" A Victorian woman is facing almost 300 animal cruelty charges after wildlife officers allegedly found the carcasses of 140 protected native birds, including 128 wedge-tailed eagles, at her property. The office of the conservation regulator said police, wildlife officers, and officials from the agriculture department searched the woman’s property in Violet Town in August after a number of dead wedge-tailed eagles were found in the area. She has been charged with 291 breaches of the Wildlife Act 1975 and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986, including offences relating to poisoning the birds of prey. The maximum penalty for killing native birds or being in possession of them without a licence carries hefty fines or penalties of up to two years in jail. The woman will face court in Benalla next year. The chief conservation regulator, Kate Gavens, said her office took matters like this “very seriously”. “Wedge-tailed eagles are Victoria’s largest bird of prey and an important part of our environment,” Gavens said. “This investigation shows the conservation regulator’s commitment to combating wildlife crime and protecting the iconic wedge-tailed eagle.” Wedge-tailed eagles are seen as a pest by some farmers because of concerns they will prey on lambs, but the department of environment, land, water and planning says the birds very rarely take healthy lambs and never full-grown sheep. Wildlife experts have said killing the resident pair creates a territorial vacuum that encourages more birds to come.  To report wildlife crime contact CrimeStoppers on 1800 333 000."
"Fish populations will continue to be over-exploited in EU waters, partly as a result of Brexit, after a decision on next year’s fishing quotas among EU countries fell well short of scientific advice. Fishing limits are set to exceed scientific advice for about a third of EU fish stocks, after EU ministers met on Thursday morning, with EU member states citing the uncertainty regarding fishing rights after Brexit as a reason for breaching limits on sustainable catches. The Brexit-fuelled dispute among EU ministers on fishing quotas in the north-east Atlantic means the EU target to end overfishing by 2020, set in legislation from 2013, will now be missed. This year was supposed to be when “total allowable catches” for fish in EU waters were set in line with scientific advice for the first time in the history of the EU common fisheries policy. It was supposed to be when the wasteful practice of throwing back healthy fish to die as discards was ended, and when fishing quotas were to be set through long-term management plans rather than annual bunfights among ministers in Brussels. Instead, EU ministers voted to roll over at least a quarter of fishing quotas from last year because they were shared with the UK, in defiance of the scientific advice. Annual disputes over fishing quotas will continue after Brexit. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, described this year’s negotiations as “exceptionally challenging” but said progress was being made towards sustainable fishing across the EU. He said: “We have brought eight total allowable catches in line with the levels that guarantee the maximum sustainable yields from those stocks. EU ministers have followed my proposals on the precautionary approach for nine fish catch quotas. This is a step in the right direction. The commission proposal was very ambitious and I welcome today’s overall good outcome. “We have also managed to respond to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and secure continued fishing for all EU fishermen and women. Vessels can take to the sea on 1 January 2021 and the fishing sector can be reassured that their business is recognised as a priority for the EU.” Rebecca Hubbard, a programme director at Our Fish, a campaigning organisation, said: “Brexit has been the excuse by which EU ministers have continued overfishing. It is very bad for sustainable fishing.” Destructive practices such as bottom trawling will continue, and the management of important fisheries in the North Sea will still be subject to annual negotiations among EU ministers and the UK. Campaigners said these decisions would harm the EU’s fisheries industries and fishing fleets in the long term. “Unfortunately, today’s outcome shows how far EU member states are from delivering their promises to their citizens, including our children who will inherit the legacy of their decisions,” said Hubbard. “EU fisheries ministers willingly lock themselves into this abusive cycle which helps nobody, not the fish, the ocean, the climate or the fishers.” Ministers agreed to higher catches than scientific advice recommends for EU-only populations, unaffected by Brexit, such as pollack and sole in the Bay of Biscay. The EU has also set limits for stocks shared with the UK to allow fishing to continue in the first three months of 2021, with that quota to be distributed among EU member states according to the existing pattern of “relative stability”. Scientists had advised a 17% cut in most catches for 2021. Campaigners said this flouted the EU’s rules on bringing fishing into line with scientific advice for 2020, but that future years could be better managed. Andrew Clayton, of the Pew Charitable Trusts, a campaigning group, said: “While smaller in scope than the usual December council decisions due to the uncertainty around shared stocks, the outcome suggests the commission is making some progress to improve management in 2021, but ministers are still opting for several catch limits in excess of scientific advice. When full limits are eventually agreed for stocks shared with UK and Norway, it is critically important that the science on sustainable fishing is followed.”"
"The Covid-19 vaccinations captured the world’s attention in November yet, around the same time, researchers behind a trial known as HPTN 084 also published spectacular results. The trial, which took place across seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, found that an eight-weekly injection with a drug called cabotegravir was more effective than daily medication in an oral pill form in preventing HIV in women. An estimated 38 million people in the world are currently living with HIV – two thirds of these people live in Africa. In South Africa, more than 62% of the 7.5 million adults living with HIV are women. While a pre-exposure prophylactic pill is currently available for people at risk, the HPTN 084 trial – undertaken by the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) and partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – found cabotegravir to be 89% more effective. “The injection overcame many of the challenges that women in the region experience with taking a daily pill,” trial chair Dr Sinéad Delany-Moretlwe says, explaining that stigma often prevents people taking their pill consistently. “Partners may feel insecure because they think it means their partners are going to be unfaithful and just generally women experience judgments about being sexually active,” she explains. Delany-Moretlwe, who works at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, says that the injection is “discreet and convenient and not visible” and therefore “overcomes barriers” for many women in African countries. The HPTN 084 trial involved 3,223 cisgender women ranging in age from 18 to 45. Only four women who received the injection acquired HIV compared to 34 women who took the pill. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a result like this for HIV prevention in women,” says Delany-Moretlwe. “This is a product that can be used by men and women, when it’s licensed, potentially, so I think that’s what’s exciting.” “I’ve worked in HIV prevention for a long time and I know we’ve had more disappointments than successes,” Delany-Moretlwe says, but “it’s an incredibly exciting result. With introduction and use of the injection, we can hopefully begin to see the reduction and possibly elimination of HIV acquisition in young women in our region.” Amelia Tait Imagine a city where power is generated from turbines and waterways. Where cycle paths, green space, allotments, veg boxes and vegan restaurants are plentiful, buses are powered by human waste and streets are closed so kids can play. It’s not a fantasy. It’s happening today in Bristol, a city increasingly feted for pioneering environmentally friendly urban life. The first city in the world to declare a climate emergency and Britain’s first European Green Capital, it is consistently top of various green matrices. This year it was judged the most environmentally friendly big British city based on high recycling rates (47.4%), generous green space (29 hectares), council seats held by the Green party (11) and carbon emissions and gas consumption. A green virtuous circle appears to be whirling in the West Country, as environmentally conscious citizens urge their leaders to make more ambitious climate commitments. In 2014, Britain’s first “poo bus” was launched, its journeys between Bristol and Bath entirely powered by human and food waste. Bristol’s leaders have looked further ahead than most. Back in 2007, the city began powering its 34,000 street lights with green electricity and, by 2014/15, it had reduced its emissions by 38% compared with 2005. The Bristol Energy Co-operative’s most exciting new scheme proposes using the water flowing through Netham weir in the city to generate electricity. A community team working at the Lawrence Weston housing estate gained planning permission for the tallest turbine of its kind in England, which will power all 3,500 homes in the area. Other schemes include a phone app using thermal imaging to help 70% of residents who struggle to pay their electricity bills identify the energy efficiency of their homes. Traders then fix problems for an affordable fee. Mark Pepper, project development manager of Ambition Lawrence Weston, says “from being seen as a middle-class problem” paying attention to the climate crisis is now seen as a way of investing in the future. As well as being a middle-class concern, environmental issues have typically been championed by people who are overwhelmingly white. This, too, is changing in Bristol, the first major city in Europe to elect a black mayor, Marvin Rees. “Someone said, ‘I hear the voice, I hear what the voice says but I don’t hear my voice’,” says Carlton Romaine, coordinator of the Black and Green Ambassadors project in Bristol, which aims to create a new generation of environmental leaders from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. “We want to empower the BAME community because we’re always at the bottom and we’re usually add-ons,” says Romaine. “We want to be leading green projects or at least a partner, not just somebody that is asked to do something.” Patrick Barkham The Air Company, based in New York, makes vodka from two ingredients: carbon dioxide and water. Each bottle that’s produced takes carbon dioxide out of the air. It has been chosen as one of the finalists in the $20m NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE, which aims to incentivise innovation in the field of carbon capture, utilisation and storage. The company’s chief technology officer, Stafford Sheehan, hit upon the idea while trying to create artificial photosynthesis as a chemistry PhD student at Yale. Photosynthesis, you may remember from chemistry at school, is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert CO2 into energy. For 2bn years, plants were equal to the task of balancing the carbon in the atmosphere – but now we are emitting it at a rate beyond what nature can restore with photosynthesis. Hence the interest in carbon capture. “Our aim is to take CO2 that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere and transform it into things that are better for the planet,” says Sheehan A nice cold martini is undoubtedly better for the planet than global warming. Unfortunately, however, it would require 11 quadrillion Air Vodka Martinis to make any kind of significant impact. But Sheehan hopes to make alcohol for a variety of different applications. “Ethanol, methanol and propanol are three of the most-produced chemicals in the world, all alcohols,” he says. “Plastics, resins, fragrances, cleaners, sanitisers, bio-jet fuel… almost all start from alcohol. If we can make the base alcohol for all of those from carbon that would otherwise be emitted, that would make a major impact.” Air Company currently captures its CO2 from old-fashioned alcohol production: concentrated CO2 rising from a standard fuel-alcohol fermentation stack is transformed into vodka. That’s a fairly boutique product. However, power stations are much more plentiful sources. “You can burn natural gas, then capture the CO2 you’re emitting, and that feeds you the carbon dioxide,” says Sheehan. “That’s what we’d like to do and that’s where you can do it at scale.” Richard Godwin The Pacific Trash Vortex is the largest accumulation of rubbish in the world. Ocean currents mean the Eastern Garbage Patch near Japan is locked in a perpetual exchange of tyres, toothbrushes, discarded Minion toys, etc, with the Western Garbage Patch, between California and Hawaii. It spans more than 1m sq miles. Most of it is plastic: an estimated 87,000 metric tonnes broken down into 1.8tn tiny pieces. In 2012, a Dutch teenager named Boyan Slat gave a Ted Talk that had grown out of a school project. He revealed a plan to install a series of floating platforms that would harness those ocean currents and concentrate the rubbish in tighter areas, making it easier to remove. He founded the company Ocean Cleanup in 2013 and raised over $40m in funding. “There isn’t an instruction manual for doing this,” says Slat when I connect with him over video link – no longer a wide-eyed kid but a shaggy haired 25-year-old. After much research and trial and error, the company is now concentrating most of its efforts on rivers, stopping at source most of the plastic before it can get into the oceans. However, Ocean Cleanup achieved a significant milestone last year by extracting plastic from the ocean and turning it into something useful: sunglasses, yours for $199. The frames only represent a drop in the ocean in terms of plastic extracted, but Slat hopes they will create a virtuous circle. Each pair will fund the clean-up of up to 24 football fields of plastic from the Garbage Patch. “It would be quite poetic if we could fund the clean-up by recycling the plastic we take out.” Slat sees 2021 as an inflection point – the moment to deliver on its promises. “We have the tools to do it now. We have applied the lessons we’ve learned. Now it comes to actually doing it at scale.” What gives him hope? “The willingness of the world to address the issue. When we started, I thought the main difficulty would be people not caring – and the technology would be relatively easy. Actually it’s the opposite. But that makes me hopeful that when all the tools are there, it will actually happen. It is possible, even in this time when everything seems so polarised, to tackle problems through all the things humans are good at: entrepreneurship, ingenuity, creativity. It can bring people together. Things that seem insoluble can be solved.” Richard Godwin Antarctic blue whales Blue whales were abundant off South Georgia before industrial whaling arrived in 1904. By the 1970s they had vanished from the surrounding seas. Between 1998 and 2018 there was only a single sighting. This year, that changed: there have been 58 blue whale sightings. Kakapo The kakapo is the world’s heaviest, longest-lived parrot – a flightless, nocturnal creature which, like New Zealand’s other flightless birds, was imperilled by the mammalian predators introduced by humans. Years of conservation efforts had saved it from extinction, but then the species was struck down by the respiratory disease aspergillosis. Stricken birds were helicoptered to Auckland and treated in a human hospital with a paediatric nebuliser. The virus was contained and the population now stands at 213. Beavers It seemed like 2020 was the year every grand estate obtained a licence to release beavers into large, fenced enclosures. The beaver is increasingly valued as a natural flood-defence engineer, with its dams storing water upstream and slowing the flow of flood water, protecting towns downstream. Its ponds and channels have also been shown to benefit fish, amphibians, insects and birds. This year, the government in England allowed beavers unofficially released in the River Otter in Devon to stay, paving the way for its return as a natural native species, 400 years after being hunted to extinction. Great fox spider The critically endangered spider was feared to be extinct in Britain. But the nocturnal 5cm arachnid, known for its speed, agility and ambush hunting, has been rediscovered on a Ministry of Defence site in Surrey. Mike Waite from Surrey Wildlife Trust rediscovered the spider after being allowed in to survey the area over a two-year period. MoD sites are often wildlife havens with land undisturbed by the general public. Hen harrier A fine spring and summer across the UK meant that voles bred prolifically in the wild, in turn helping birds of prey enjoy successful breeding years. The endangered hen harrier enjoyed its best breeding year for nearly two decades. Nineteen nests produced 60 chicks. Patrick Barkham Four years ago, Rebecca Mayhew lost her job, then the pigs on the farm she owned with her husband Stuart were plagued by health problems due to the way they were intensively farmed. The couple became uneasy about the animals’ welfare and the health of their conventionally farmed land, so they sold their pigs and took a holiday in Scotland, where Rebecca fell in love with a friend’s Jersey cows. Four years on, their once-conventional arable and pig farm is a very different beast. The Mayhews have embraced regenerative farming, a way of working that aims to fix the food production system by restoring degraded soils and reducing and ultimately eliminating artificial fertilisers and pesticides. The revolution at the Mayhews’ 500-acre South Norfolk farm began with a small herd of Jersey cows. Unlike a traditional dairy, where calves are removed from their mothers after a few hours and fed formula, they chose to produce milk naturally, allowing calves to feed from their mothers, who are milked just once a day. “Looking into what’s good for the cows, and what’s good for us led us into looking at what’s good for the land,” says Rebecca. The Mayhews have jettisoned the farming orthodoxies of the past half-century. Ploughing is sacrilege: it erodes fertile top-soil. Decades of relentless scaling-up is turned on its head: big fields are turned into smaller fields – hedges replanted to stop erosion and provide shade and fodder for the cattle. Grazing fields that would normally be sown with a monoculture of rye-grass are instead seeded with up to 20 species to provide healthier food for the cattle (which, in turn, need fewer expensive veterinary drugs). Arable fields are planted with “cover crops”: so clovers are planted alongside barley or oats. Clovers are “nitrogen-fixing” plants that take nitrogen from the atmosphere and add it to soil, so it can be used by other plants – a free fertiliser and soil-improver. “Modern conventional farming is a constant war with nature. It’s about killing everything so one plant can grow,” says Mayhew. “We need to mimic nature and work with it.” The Mayhews’ new way of farming is nature-friendly so they’ve been able to take advantage of government subsidies for wildlife-enhancing farming. British farmers know that generous EU farm subsidies are coming to an end and farm payments in the future are likely to be more dependent on farms providing environmental “goods” such as healthy soils and clean water. Patrick Barkham Between the ages of 42 and 57, Bernardeta Gómez from Spain couldn’t see a thing. But then scientists embedded a port into her skull and after 16 years of blindness, Gómez was able to see again. It was all thanks to the innovations of Eduardo Fernandez, director of neuroengineering at the University of Miguel Hernández in Elche, Spain. Fernandez is working on a unique cure for blindness – instead of developing an artificial retina, he has created a device that restores sight by feeding signals directly to the brain. As the majority of blind people have damage to the nerve system connecting the retina and the brain, Fernandez’s work could help more people than developing an artificial eye. Fernandez has compared his prosthesis to a pacemaker or cochlear implants, both of which are pieces of electronic equipment that have been widely implanted into humans for more than 60 years. His system is made of a small camera attached to a pair of slightly outsized black glasses. This relays live video to a computer, which translates the footage into electronic signals. These signals are sent through a cable to a 100-electrode implant in the brain’s visual cortex (hence the port in the back of Gómez’s head), which deliver currents directly to the brain, producing sight. Gómez was able to see a low-resolution representation of objects rendered by white-yellow dots and shapes. She could see lights, letters and shapes at 10 pixels by 10 pixels. Although she couldn’t make out human faces, she was able to play a simple computer game “piped directly into her brain”. Unfortunately, the implant had to be removed after a year. “The body’s immune system starts to break down the electrodes and surround them with scar tissue,” explains Fernandez, “which eventually weakens the signal.” He hopes to continue testing his bionic eye while figuring out ways to stop the implant degrading. Ultimately, the prosthesis will be wireless. Amelia Tait Among the many novel terms that have entered our lives lately – “lockdown,” “herd immunity,” “flatten the curve” – one is decidedly more glamorous. In November it was suggested that “Dollying” should become shorthand for referencing an occasion when a celebrity does something that makes you love them even more. This was in response to the revelation that Dolly Parton had contributed $1m towards the Moderna Covid vaccine, news which was met with euphoria as we collectively – and only slightly melodramatically – exclaimed that Dolly had “saved the world”. Yet before we add “Dollying” to the dictionary, let’s consider the competition. How about “Doing a Rashford”, in reference to Man Utd’s striker Marcus Rashford forcing the UK government to confront child poverty and reinstate free meals for underprivileged schoolchildren? “Riri-ing” could also work, following Rihanna’s donation of $2m to charities supporting domestic-violence victims during lockdown. And then there’s “Pitting” (I sense this cute word game has now run its course), after Brad Pitt was spotted delivering groceries to disadvantaged LA households. The internet squealed with delight. These acts stand out in a year in which celebrities have been stripped of red carpets and live concerts and rendered impotent, left to spout platitudes over social media. Philanthropy has become common ever since Bob Geldof’s Live Aid concerts for famine-stricken Ethiopia in the 1980s, and is now so widespread it’s “almost part of the job description of an A-list star,” says Jo Littler, sociology professor at London’s City University. It is, she adds, “a form of brand promotion”. This means we have an ingrained scepticism when we see a celebrity doing a good thing: is it genuine or a PR play? Evan Ross Katz, a fashion writer and podcast host, says acts resonate when, instead of “affixing themselves to something because it’s trendy,” the celeb has a personal connection to the cause. Such was the case with Rashford, who subsisted on free school meals growing up, or ASAP Rocky, who last month delivered meals to the homeless shelter in New York where he and his mum sought refuge when he was young. Gestures needn’t be grand. Ryan Reynolds recently sent 300 parkas to a school in the remote Inuit community of Arctic Bay after the town’s mayor tweeted that they were desperate for winter gear. Justin Timberlake bought a wheelchair-friendly van for a teenager with cerebral palsy. And Taylor Swift’s longstanding custom of helping out regular folks continued when she paid for an 18-year-old to study maths at a UK university. We don’t need our celebs to be decent people but when they are – and in a way that isn’t overly forced and holier-than-thou – it provides a much-needed boost to our battered morale. Jamie Waters At first glance, Jarod Rollins’s work looks like magic. In a cove on an island off the coast of Maine, Rollins spends his days examining transparent worms in the hopes of extending human life. Of course, it’s not really magic, it’s science: Rollins works at the MDI Biological Laboratory, a non-profit research institution, and is motivated by a desire to “help people age more gracefully or even turn back the ageing process”. In July 2019, Rollins and 10 other researchers from across the globe made a monumental breakthrough: they increased the lifespan of some Caenorhabditis elegans worms by 500%. The reason these unassuming roundworms are frequently used in ageing research is because they share many of their genes with humans. An ordinary C elegans worm will live for three to four weeks – Rollins and his team kept them alive for months. “If we do make a discovery in C elegans and find a gene that helps regulate the rate at which they age, there is a good chance that that research is going to apply directly or indirectly to humans,” he explains. “I’m not in the business of making worms live longer,” he laughs, “I want to make people live longer and healthier, and worms are just one step on the way.” The worms in the experiment lived longer because his colleagues in China altered two signalling pathways in their cells. These pathways were previously both linked to ageing – in the past, experiments altering one of the pathways had doubled C elegans’s life expectancy, while experiments with the other increased the worms’ lifespan by 30%. The team expected that altering both pathways simultaneously would see worms living 130% longer. Instead, they lived five times longer. Mutating the two pathways sends signals to cells telling them to use dietary nutrients to go into “maintenance mode” instead of “growth mode” – fixing the damage caused by age. But what are the immediate repercussions? Rollins explains that scientists used to look for one “silver bullet” in anti-ageing research, but the therapies that “are going to have the most effect are probably going to stimulate multiple different genetic pathways at once… This is really going to change how people look at the ageing process.” Amelia Tait Troubled eras have always inspired positive human progress – and 2020 will be no different, says Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford University This year has been a terrible and chastening experience. But rather than allow doom and despair to sweep us away, we should be optimistic about the future – and in the long run, we might just owe 2020 a debt of thanks, rather than mutter its name with spite. The experiences of this year will – and must – teach important lessons about being better prepared for future epidemics. It will lead to greater understanding of how to plan and execute large-scale emergency responses more quickly and more efficiently and with better outcomes. And it will make us think about the risks and threats in the world around us with greater clarity and depth. The fact that Covid-19 vaccines have been developed with astonishing speed might encourage those who fear the worst about other big problems. Climate change is the most obvious mega-threat: in the long run, our pandemic experiences must help with that. While Covid hit the economy, one outcome may be smarter policy that looks to keep people in jobs, ensures towns and city centres remain vibrant and encourages small businesses to flourish and grow – rather than enabling virtual monopolies to impose strangleholds over the economy which heighten social inequalities. And 2020 has forced a recalibration of ambitions and expectations on a personal level. At the start of the year, our aims might have included a promotion or a higher salary. Today, those hopes have been replaced by something rather more modest and, indeed, better for us: to see friends, visit the pub, watch live sports, go to the theatre or visit somewhere new. Outside the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd in May proved a catalyst in raising voices who demand a fairer, more equitable and kinder society. It forced global public attention to focus on the realities of discrimination and racism, to recognise that there might be better alternatives to having statutes of rich slave-owners towering over town squares and that cultural imperialism did not end when the age of empire did. Beyond 2020? We would do well to remember that, in the past 30 years, more people have been lifted out of poverty than ever before; more children and mothers have survived childbirth; more people are able to read and write than at any point in human history. For all the horrors of the year, hope is still present – as the historian Agathias wrote in the sixth century, times of disaster throw up prophets who talk about doom and gloom and predict how much worse things will get with great certainty. Much better, then, to be positive and optimistic."
"New international rules to tackle the “wild west” global trade in plastic, which has seen wealthy nations dump contaminated plastic waste on to poorer ones, will result in a cleaner ocean within five years, according to a UN transboundary waste chief. The rules, which come into force on 1 January, aim to make the trade more transparent in order to allow developing nations such as Vietnam and Malaysia to refuse low-quality, difficult-to-recycle waste before it is even shipped. “It is my optimistic view that, in five years, we will see results,” said Rolph Payet, the executive director of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions. “People on the frontline are going to be telling us whether there is a decrease of plastic in the ocean. I don’t see that happening in the next two to three years, but on the horizon of five years. This amendment is just the beginning.” At the moment, developing countries – many of which have recycling industries that take in shipments from other nations – cannot see whether a given shipment of plastic is actually recyclable or if it is too contaminated to use before it arrives. Waste that cannot be recycled usually ends up being illegally burned or dumped in landfills or waterways. Only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled. About 12% has been incinerated. The other 79% has accumulated in landfill, dumps and the natural environment, where it often ends up washing into rivers via wastewater, rain and floods. Much of it eventually ends up in the ocean. The new rules, agreed by more than 180 nations under an amendment to the Basel convention, introduce a system of “prior informed consent” for all exports of difficult-to-recycle or contaminated plastic. Payet acknowledged that tighter export controls may at first see major plastic exporting nations, such as the UK and the US, dispose of waste in landfill and incinerators instead. “In the short term, yes, there will be landfilling, there will be incineration of the plastic waste,” he said. “But in the long term, if government policies are right and if consumers keep applying pressure, it will create the environment for more recycling and a circular approach when it comes to plastic.” Turkey is the largest export market for British plastic waste, with Malaysia second, according to October data. So far this year, Britain has had 22 repatriation requests from seven countries to take back plastic exports, the Environment Agency told the Guardian. They include Malaysia, which sent back 42 containers of “illegal” waste in January, as well as Indonesia, Vietnam, Romania, Croatia, Poland and Belgium. Under the new rules, prior consent would have been needed for 20 of those 22 requests, presumably resulting in refusals. The Basel amendment has been incorporated into UK law, allowing UK regulators to implement and enforce it. Payet said China’s ban on plastic waste imports in 2018 had sent “shockwaves” through developed nations, who were reliant on China to take material they could not recycle themselves. “The China export ban was a signal to the world that something was seriously wrong and we had to fix it.” As well as plastic waste, developing nations also export the hidden health and environmental costs of disposal. Many of the nations that import problematic or heavily contaminated plastic lack the proper facilities to deal with it. “It was the wild west for plastics,” Payet said. “It was easier for everybody to put everything in a container and export it without asking questions: ‘Does this country have the capacity to deal with it, the technology to deal with it – and also, what can we do with the things we can’t recycle?’” The amendment is a “catalyst” for change, he said, and it is now up to governments to encourage the recycling sector, an industry with low profit margins, and other private sector firms, to innovate. “There is a lot of pressure from industry, from consumers, from supermarkets, to be innovative. Covid-19 has thrown a spanner into the works, but it also helps us to reflect a lot more on how we can repackage food in a healthier way.” The UK, which alongside the US is the world’s largest producer of plastic, exports two-thirds of its plastic waste. Britain’s total plastic waste exports to non-EU countries in October was 22.9m kg, of which 13.9m kg went to Turkey.  A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said it had pledged to ban the export of polluting plastic waste to non-OECD countries and to introduce tougher controls on waste exports, though as of October the UK was still sending 7.1m kg to Malaysia, which is not in the OECD. Simon Ellin, of the UK Recycling Association, warned that the new rules could mean more waste plastic going into domestic landfill or incineration. “In the UK we export about 70% of the plastic we collect because we don’t have the processing capacity to handle it,” said Ellin. “A lot more will be incinerated and landfilled.” Despite that “short-term hiccup”, said Tim Grabiel, a lawyer with the Environmental Investigation Agency, the new rules would have a positive impact. “I personally believe that from an ethical and environmental perspective, it can have a very positive effect,” he said. “[Contaminated plastic] has been an economic burden on developing countries. We will see a lesser amount coming to developing countries, and it will free up their waste management capacity for their own domestic waste.”"
"The mother of Ella Kissi-Debrah has called on the mayor of London to rethink his plans for a new four-lane road tunnel under the Thames warning it will drive up pollution with a potentially devastating impact on young people’s health. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, speaking after a coroner ruled that illegal levels of air pollution had caused the death of her nine-year-old daughter in 2013, said it was critical Sadiq reconsider the £2bn scheme. “I am kindly asking the mayor of London to take another look at the tunnel as there is absolutely no evidence that air quality will improve especially for the most polluted schools,” she said. Kissi-Debrah fought a seven-year campaign for justice for her daughter, and the coroner’s ruling is believed to be the first in the world to identify air pollution as a cause of death. In a landmark narrative verdict, Philip Barlow, inner south London coroner, said Ella died from acute respiratory failure, severe asthma and air pollution exposure. Now Kissi-Debrah says she has looked at the “impact assessment reports” of the proposed Silvertown Tunnel and is convinced it would increase dangerous levels of toxic air in an already polluted part of London. Khan has come under increasing pressure over the proposed tunnel with a growing list of MPs, councillors, environmentalists and residents coming out against the project. They argue it will increase pollution, drive up car use and increase emissions in the midst of a climate crisis. The shadow climate change minister, Matthew Pennycook, whose Greenwich and Woolwich constituency would contain one end of the tunnel, earlier this year called on Khan, a Labour mayor, to reverse the plan. Lyn Brown, the Labour MP for West Ham, where the other end of the tunnel would be, has also called for the project to be scrapped. The rising cost of the scheme has come under scrutiny. In September the Guardian revealed that the project could cost nearly £2bn over the next three decades if it goes ahead. The figure – which includes the construction, maintenance and operation of the tunnel as well as interest payments on the debt – is more than twice the original estimate. In June, a report from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, backed by some of the UK’s leading climate scientists, found that the development was incompatible with the Greater London Authority’s aim to become carbon-neutral by 2030. But Khan’s administration has repeatedly defended the scheme, saying it was essential to improve river crossings in east London that are “antiquated and worn out”. City Hall insists the new tunnel would provide a “public transport-focused river crossing” with improved bus links, and be paid for by introducing tolls on both the Blackwall tunnel and at Silvertown. But Kissi-Debrah said instead of focusing on a new road tunnel the mayor should extend the planned ultra low emissions zone [Ulez], which is due to be widened from its current central London zone to the north and south circular from October 2021. “Based on the success of the Ulez can the mayor rather consider implementing it London wide? 250,000 children have an asthma diagnosis and they will breathe better and it would save lives.”"
"The mother of Ella Kissi-Debrah called for her legacy to be the passing of a new clean air act to force the government in the UK to clean up the environment for future generations of children. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah spoke after a coroner ruled that illegal levels of air pollution, predominantly from traffic, had caused the death of her nine year old daughter in south London in February 2013. The coroner’s ruling was the first in the world – experts believe – to identify air pollution as a cause of an individual’s death. In a landmark narrative verdict, Philip Barlow, inner south London coroner, said Ella died from acute respiratory failure, severe asthma and air pollution exposure. He ruled that the “recognised failure” of government and other bodies, to reduce nitrogen dioxide levels or to provide information to the public about their risks, was a possible contribution to the schoolgirl’s death. “Ella died of asthma contributed to by exposure to excessive air pollution,” said the coroner on Wednesday. Ella lived within 25 metres of the south circular road in Lewisham, and other busy routes. During her lifetime nitrogen dioxide emissions in Lewisham, where she lived, exceeded EU and national legal limits and World Health Organization guidelines. Particulate matter (PM), PMs 10 and 2.5, levels were above the WHO guidelines. In the three years before her death, Ella had multiple seizures and was admitted to hospital 27 times after severe asthma attacks. “The whole of Ella’s life was lived in close proximity to highly polluting roads,” the coroner said. “I have no difficulty in concluding that her personal exposure to nitrogen dioxide and PM was very high.” Air pollution he said had induced and exacerbated her severe asthma. Seven years on from Ella’s death, nitrogen dioxide emissions met legal limits across the borough for the first time last year, but particulate pollution continued to exceed World Health Organization limits. The inquest was the second into Ella Kissi-Debrah’s death. The first hearing in 2014 did not consider air pollution as a cause of death. But her mother fought to find the truth about what was causing her daughter’s acute asthma attacks, collapses and respiratory and cardiac arrests. She forced a second inquest after her lawyer presented new evidence from Prof Stephen Holgate, a world expert, which found that air pollution levels at the Catford monitoring station a mile from her home consistently exceeded lawful EU and national legal limits. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said after the ruling: “We’ve got the justice for her which she so deserved”. She said she needed time to reflect on the ruling. “I think that it would be a fitting legacy, to bring in a new Clean Air Act and for governments – I’m not just talking about the UK government – governments around the world to take this matter seriously. “My biggest desire is to prevent future deaths, anything that saves future lives I am going to be in support of.” Kissi-Debrah said rather than a blame game, there needed to be a public awareness campaign with clear, concise, messages to teach the population about the damage air pollution is doing. Environmental lawyers, and campaigners joined the call for a radical and broad focused new clean air act – akin to the one introduced after the Great Smog in the 1950s, to be passed. Simon Birkett, Founder and Director of Clean Air in London, said: “It is the duty of the government to protect life and the environment for current and future generations and to do this they need a new Clean Air Act which will deal with present pollution and clean up the environment for future generations.” Illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide should have been reduced in the UK and Europe by 2010, but the latest data shows 75% of air quality reporting zones in the UK are still breaching legal limits, and levels across the continent are also still unlawful. The Government recently threw out an attempt to get tougher WHO limits on PM pollutants into the environment bill, with Rebecca Pow, air quality minister, questioning the “economic viability and practical deliverability’ of the stricter target. “In the seven years since Ella died, nearly a quarter of a million other UK families have suffered tragedy as a result of vulnerable loved-ones breathing toxic air – four times more than those killed by Covid this year,” said Greg Archer, of the NGO Transport & Environment. “In modern Britain this is inexcusable and preventable.” The failure of successive governments to meet legal limits led ClientEarth, the environmental legal group, to successfully taken the UK government to court three times. Katie Neild, UK clean air lawyer for Client Earth, said: “The inquest has thrown into sharp relief just how long the government has known about the harm that air pollution wreaks on people’s lives and how slow they have been to react. How many more lives will be lost before ministers act to clean up the air with the urgency and ambition that people’s health deserves?” Jocelyn Cockburn, the human rights lawyer who represented Ella’s family, said under article 2 of the Human Rights Act, the right to life, there was a compulsion on the government to act or take reasonable steps to protect life. “I think it entirely possible in relation to those people who have been affected by air pollution that they could use the Human Rights Act to try and enforce their right to breathe clean air … and there may be other legal avenues in relation to forcing the government to take steps to reduce air pollution levels or to inform the public.” Responding to the verdict, a government spokesman said: “Our thoughts remain with Ella’s family and friends. “We are delivering a £3.8bn plan to clean up transport and tackle NO2 pollution and going further in protecting communities from air pollution.”"
"When Julie Blackburn was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2016 she was told to avoid her triggers, scenarios which cause upsetting flashbacks. “But when your trigger is rain, there is no getting over it,” she said. “My husband and I don’t sleep when it’s raining, we take it in turns to stand at the window watching the rain – it’s just living in constant fear.” Blackburn’s house in Old Coulsdon, Croydon, has been flooded several times, first in 2000 when heavy rain overwhelmed the Victorian sewer system and filled her home with toxic waste. Rapid development and poor infrastructure led the south London borough to be rated the fourth worst area in England and Wales for surface water flooding in 2011. “You wouldn’t believe how long it takes to get over a flood. And I wouldn’t wish anyone to experience it,” said Blackburn, 52, who spends one to three hours a day on flood campaigning once she has finished work as a Cad technician. Even two decades on from the first major flood at the property, Blackburn struggles to feel comfortable inviting people over and fears leaving the house for too long. When they were away over the summer and the street flooded, neighbours had to deploy their sandbags. “It’s not just a little bit of water in your house, it’s the whole knock-on effect,” Blackburn said. “Mental health illness is still a taboo so perhaps it’s just not spoken about.” Research from the University of York and the Centre for Mental Health found people who have been flooded in the UK are nine times more likely to experience long-term mental health problems than the general population. PTSD was the most commonly reported condition, with a prevalence rate of between 7.06% and 43.7%. Anxiety and depression were also common. The report, which examined studies on flooding events in the UK from 1968 to 2016, found people affected by flooding experienced anxiety during heavy rain even years after being flooded. Symptoms included stress, sleep problems, panic attacks, nightmares, anger, mood swings and increased use of alcohol, prescription drugs or antidepressants. “We clearly need to think about longer term deployment of resources to areas that have been affected by flooding,” said Andy Bell, the deputy chief executive at the Centre for Mental Health. “For many people, mental health impacts may be felt years after the event but they’re just as serious.” Nikki Stocks, 59, lives in Todmorden, Calderdale, an area in West Yorkshire that has been particularly hit by floods in recent years – some residents have been flooded six times in the last five years. “You’re living on a knife edge, and it doesn’t ever seem to settle,” she said. “You don’t want to be reminded, you don’t want sandbags at your door all the time, but that’s how we live here.” She lives alone and is disabled, receiving her income through benefits, so has struggled to get her house repaired completely from when it was last flooded in 2015. “I can’t get loans to get it done all in one go, it’s just a slow process of saving a bit of money and then getting a bit of work done,” she said. Living with depression and PTSD, Stocks has relied heavily on the local charity Healthy Minds Calderdale over the years. “I feel like they saved my life,” she said. Lou Birks, the charity’s team lead for the area, said they launched a flooding project focused on bringing the community together so those affected could support each other. “We do support groups for people who want to just get stuff off their chest, and one-off workshops, for example on managing anxiety. “Every time it rains consistently, heavily, people’s anxiety levels go up. This is the climate we live in. It’s almost like a rolling programme of newly anxious people as we continue to get flooded.” Another Todmorden resident who has been flooded, Paul O’Reilly, said he experienced “massive anxiety attacks” during the storms in February this year, even though the water only came up to his back garden. “I get anxiety attacks when I read weather forecasts that predict awful weather. The threat of floods and heavy storms are triggers for me,” said the 67-year-old. “I used to think rain was a bloody nuisance, but then it became an enemy.” Dr Joana Cruz, a research associate at the University of York who led the study, said as the climate crisis increases the frequency and strength of storms, “we must provide tools for these communities to build resilience prior to flooding”. She added that more research on the issue is needed, particularly looking at the impact of flooding on people from minority ethnic backgrounds. The study also showed displacement and loss of a sense of place and home were common factors that underscored mental health problems related to flooding, even up to a year afterwards. O’Reilly, whose ground floor was gutted and rebuilt after floods in 2000 and then repaired and redecorated again after 2012 floods, said: “It’s like a major invasion of your privacy, it’s something that comes as a shock to the system that you’ve never experienced before.” With the added stress of coronavirus, O’Reilly has found this year particularly tough, but like many he has found solace in sharing his burden with people around him. “I’ve always been a self-reliant person, but you have to swallow it and say you need help sometimes, and I’m glad it’s been there when I needed it,” he said. For Stocks, she hopes that greater awareness of the mental health repercussions of flooding will encourage people to come forward: “It’s got to be talked about, even though it stresses me and I get upset, because if it isn’t talked about, it gets buried and people think they’re on their own.”"
"It’s a fine, crisp day and the first frost of the season, a significant occasion for any gardener and one that has not gone unnoticed by the seed guardians of the Stroud Community Seed Bank. Beth Richardson, a 27-year-old student midwife and coordinator at the seed bank, meets me by a big compost heap that steams on contact with the icy cold air. The heap, a valuable group resource, belongs to the allotment where Beth grows her crops. In allotment greenhouses and back-garden potting sheds across towns, cities and villages in the UK, communities of local growers are digging deep and planting the seeds for a richer, more diverse and more resilient food system. It is a trend being repeated all over the world. “Seeds are so powerful, so vital to life, but the range and variety of seeds that the big companies provide are very narrow,” says Josie Cowgill, one of the Stroud seed bank’s 30-strong growers and seed-savers. “In our small way, we are trying to, in each of our gardens or on the land that we grow food on, increase the biodiversity within our plots and within Stroud.” The Stroud Community Seed Bank in Gloucestershire is one of hundreds of initiatives across the UK focusing its seed-saving efforts on “open pollinated seed”, which – providing there is no cross pollination – will reliably produce viable, true-to-type plants year after year. Rather than being locked into a cycle of buying new seed every season, seed can be saved and stored for future use. “What we have to do to combat the very narrow genetic basis to our seed is get as many people as possible growing as wide a diversity of seeds as possible,” says Kate McEvoy of Real Seeds, a small-scale producer specialising in open pollinated seed for organic growing. Sally Oates’s garden can be heard before it is seen. Situated among acre upon acre of bare, intensively farmed fields her comparatively small plot of land appears to be a lone island of sweet, thundering birdsong. Oates says her garden, enclosed by luscious green hedges, provides its own compost and its own seeds. “What I would encourage is other gardeners to get together locally and form what is called a seed circle so within the group they can grow their favourite old varieties. When they have surplus seeds they can just exchange them. Even a few gardeners getting together, you can have quite a variety of seeds between you.” Simon Allen, another of Stroud’s seed guardians, adds: “It doesn’t need a knowledge of genetics, it just needs observation and care.” Richardson explains that “after a number of years, the seed is more adapted to the soils, climate and conditions that it’s been grown in, if the strongest specimens are selected. It’s essentially a better crop grown in Stroud because over the years it has evolved to the conditions here. It becomes a landrace.” Seed guardian Annie Page, whose polytunnels teem with bright red tomatoes, describes her garden as her sanctuary. It’s not difficult to see why. Rows of cabbages and Thrupp parsnips stand proud in the morning sun that streams into the steep valley. “One of the landrace varieties we all grow is called the Thrupp parsnip. Thrupp is a village just outside Stroud, and the lady who saves the seed has been doing it for years. It grows really well in our area. It has adapted so it’s going to be slightly different to parsnip seeds anywhere else in the world. We are developing the seeds by saving them.” Although there are many safeguards around the world for the preservation of seeds, such as the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and the Millennium Seed Bank at Kew, the continual evolution and specialisation of these saved seeds is of significant value to the robustness, resilience and diversity of seed globally. Sinead Fortune, programme manager of the Seed Sovereignty Programme, says: “By being grown out and maintained by seed guardians, they’re still living and developing. They’re still a real living entity, as opposed to a static seed in a bank somewhere.” McEvoy adds: “The more you have these things being grown on a local scale and by many people, the more resilient it is. You haven’t got just one point of failure. You’ve got multiple backups.” One of the few upsides of the lockdowns over the past year has been a huge boost in demand for seed. The seed guardians hope this could be the green shoots of a “grow your own” revolution that re-diversifies seed crops. McEvoy says that in the spring not only the Stroud seed bank but “all the home garden seed companies were basically having to just shut down their websites. They had more orders than they could actually get out the door.” Fortune, who works with many national suppliers, wondered if seed might be the new loo-roll, and if people were stockpiling. The question was whether sales were eventually going to come down but “they’ve stayed constantly much, much higher” she says. “This is promising because it means that maybe a shift is really starting to happen. I think those empty shelves in March and April were a bit of a wake-up call for a lot of people; there’s a groundswell going on. That’s very exciting. “There are brilliant things going on in every single city,” she adds. “There are community gardens and community allotments. If people don’t have a garden or access to land, there are a lot of initiatives to get engaged on all sorts of levels. I would really urge them to see what is going on in the community.” For the seed guardians in Stroud and across the country, the quiet, radical work of drying seeds on window ledges and in airing cupboards continues. Cowgill says the process is “good for the soul” and extends an open invitation to other would-be growers to begin playing in the soil, with potentially hugely positive consequences for the individual and the planet. She sums up the impact of seed-saving in the context of 2020: “It’s difficult times we are living in. We have got a pandemic, we’ve got climate change, we’ve got biodiversity loss, habitat loss and economic collapse as well. It might feel quite small, just saving beans and growing your own food, but actually I think it is really fundamental. “By doing something infinitesimally small like this tiny little gesture in a tiny little group, in a tiny little country somewhere, you are working towards something that makes you feel more hopeful. It’s a positive step. I’m not saying this is a magic wand or a cure-all, but it’s a positive step.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"When Pushki was brought to his new home on 12 November, he was scared, dangerously skinny and severely dehydrated. The two-week-old sea otter pup had been found crying on the beach in Homer, Alaska, seemingly having been separated from his mother. He needed help, fast. Now, nearly a month later, he’s running the show at the Alaska SeaLife Center (ASLC), an aquatic rehabilitation, scientific research and education facility in Seward, Alaska. The young sea otter, whose name captures his mischievous spirit (Pushki is another name for the Alaskan plant known as a cow parsnip, which can sometimes cause burns), has been keeping his veterinary team busy with his playful baby antics. “He’s incredibly lucky to have this second chance at life,” said Lisa Hartman, the ASLC husbandry director. “If we weren’t here, he likely wouldn’t be either.” But earlier this year, the research center seemed like the one in trouble. The ASLC is the only facility in the state that rehabilitates aquatic animals, and has a zoo and aquarium that are open to the public; in a normal summer, the center sees more than 160,000 visitors, largely from out of state. This year – because the vast majority of Alaska’s summer tourists come in on cruise ships, all of which were canceled due to the pandemic – it saw only a fourth of it normal numbers. The future of the 22-year-old center – and the more than 4,000 creatures it houses – appeared uncertain. On 13 July, the ASLC announced they would be forced to close permanently unless they were able to raise $2m by the end of September. Their plea resonated: by 1 October they had raised $4m, over half of which came from individual donors. Tara Riemer, CEO and president, said while they’re not yet operating at their prior level, at least they will remain open and be able to continue caring for their animals and conducting important research through the winter. With several species of seals, a few sea lions, myriad fish and an assortment of marine birds, the ASLC has made a name for itself as a bustling aquarium in small-town Seward (population: 2,700). But it also punches well above its weight in the global conservation and science arenas. The animals cared for at the center – some of which, like Pushki, have just been rescued and others which have been living there for much longer – have helped inform the greater aquatic and arctic research. One of the center’s newest studies is looking at ice seals, who historically haven’t been studied as rigorously by the scientific community as some of their aquatic peers. Studying the seals, as the ice they reside on melts due to global warming, helps give researchers an understanding of “what’s happening with our environment and our ecosystems in real time”, according to Hartman. “We’ve been able to gather information that nobody else has been able to gather before,” said Hartman. Their longest-running study began more than 20 years ago, when Steller sea lions became listed as endangered. By examining a nearby rookery over multiple generations, researchers have been able to study what threatens their existence. In the time since, they have learned about what makes for a successful breeding period for the Steller sea lions and what are some of the biggest obstacles for the juveniles to make it to adulthood. “You get an incredibly different perspective by watching them over so many years,” said John Maniscalco, the lead scientist of the study since its inception. “A lot of studies don’t last this long. You’re not going to get that understanding of how things are changing in one year versus five, 10 or 20 years.” The center is the only facility in the state capable of rehabilitating aquatic animals – the few other animal facilities in the state have a different focus. The closest facility that could take sick or hurt Alaska animals is a 44-hour drive (or several hours of driving and multiple flight connections) away in Vancouver, Canada, and getting permits to export animals is challenging. For animals rescued in poor shape, waiting that long is often not an option. The ASLC is also the only oiled wildlife response center in the state – meaning that, in the event of an oil spill, they had be tasked with organizing animal clean-up efforts. The ASLC hopes to empower other centers to take action if and when animals need to be rehabilitated: in recent years, the ASLC has started training professionals at zoos and aquariums nationwide on how to respond to animals that have encountered oil spills. They’re the only place in the country that offers that training. “If we were not here there would not be a resource to help train people, nor would there be a group of trained professionals locally that can immediately be deployed,” Hartman said. “Those first 72 hours are critical in getting your hands on those animals and starting treatment.” Whenever they can’t release an animal back into the wild, either due to regulations (NOAA doesn’t allow ice seals to be returned, for example) or because they missed out on learning necessary survival skills from mom (as is the case for Pushki), they’re sent to another aquarium or zoo with a goal of furthering that conservation message well beyond their state boundaries. Caring for a sea otter like Pushki is one of the most expensive endeavors the ASLC undergoes; it costs the center $25,000 a month to look after and rehabilitate him, largely due to their entirely shellfish diet. In the coming months, the ASLC will look for aquatic facilities elsewhere to house Pushki for the rest of his life. But, Hartman argues it’s worth it, because saving Pushki, and others like him, helps influence future generations to care about the world around them. Pushki will soon join the legions of other ASLC graduates who now, in some small way, teach millions around the world about the importance of healthy ecosystems and being good caretakers of the planet. “For me, the most critical thing about the Alaska SeaLife Center is about developing a sense of empathy and care for our environment and our world and the animals we share it with,” Hartman said. “We have the ability to connect people. To see what is happening in our world and try to inspire change.”"
"Two new fungi species that infect flies and eject spores out of a large hole in the insect’s abdomen “like small rockets” have been discovered in Denmark. The new species, Strongwellsea tigrinae and Strongwellsea acerosa, are host-specific and rely on two species of Danish fly – Coenosia tigrina and Coenosia testacea, according to researchers at the University of Copenhagen. While most fungi spore once the host is dead, with strongwellsea, the host continues to live for days, carrying out normal activities and socialising with other flies while the fungus consumes its genitals, fat reserves, reproductive organs and finally its muscle, all the while shooting out thousands of spores on to other individuals. After a few days, the fly lies on its back, spasms for a few hours and then dies, according to research by the University of Copenhagen and the Natural History Museum of Denmark published in the Journal of Invertebrate Pathology. The unusual tactic of keeping the host alive while releasing spores is called active host transmission (AHT). It is an effective way of getting access to other healthy individuals. Scientists think the fungi could be producing substances that “dope” their hosts (sometimes colloquially referred to as “zombies”), meaning they can stay fresh enough to live for days after infection – only collapsing once there is nothing left in their abdomens but the fungus. “We suspect therefore that these fungi may produce amphetamine-like substances which keep a fly’s energy levels high up until the end,” said lead researcher Prof Jørgen Eilenberg from the department of plant and environmental Sciences at the University of Copenhagen. Researchers also believe the fungi produce substances that keep microorganisms away from the fly fungal wound and keep it clean, but they are yet to test this. “They work like small rockets,” said Eilenberg. “They are almost shaped like torpedoes and are designed for going fast.” If they land on another fly they stick to the cuticle and then wiggle their way into the abdomen, where they start to proliferate. Thousands of spores will be released out from a single fly. The parasites probably only infect a small percentage of individuals – between 3 and 5% in a healthy fly population. Because the host continues to behave normally it is difficult to identify when it has been infected, which is why AHT is relatively under-researched. It has only been discovered in two complete genera – strongwellsea and a similar fungal genus called massospora, which uses cicadas in a similar way. Strongwellsea tigrinae was discovered by Eilenberg in 1993 in North Zealand in eastern Denmark. Strongwellsea acerosa was first seen in a residential area in greater Copenhagen by one of his students, Dorthe Britt Tiwald, in 1998. Both have only now been officially declared new species. There are now a total of five known species of strongwellsea. Dr Matthew Kasson, an associate professor of forest pathology and mycology at West Virginia University, who was not involved in this latest research, agrees strongwellsea may be producing the same “dope” compound as massospora, which he has researched. “It’s unclear how many species we have but I really think we’ve just scratched the surface,” he says. “The reason this discovery is important is because we can’t make broad, sweeping conclusions about host manipulation and behavioural modification based on a single genus. Having a second genus like strongwellsea, which induces the same behavioural response, is important in solving this bigger puzzle of active host transmission … Collectively, this group of insect-destroying fungi may represent the next frontier for drug discovery.”"
"Native oysters have unexpectedly returned to the shores of Belfast Lough after more than 100 years, researchers have discovered – though scientists are still unsure how they got there. Ostrea edulis, the European flat oyster, is listed as threatened and/or declining by the Ospar conservation scheme and is the focus of numerous biodiversity projects around Europe. But now it has impressed scientists by establishing itself in Belfast Lough without the aid of a reintroduction programme. Large numbers of oysters were last recorded in the sea inlet during the late 1800s before they were fished to oblivion a few years later. A WhatsApp photo of an oyster, found by an old friend who had taken a loughside walk, was what first alerted David Smyth at Bangor University in Wales to the recurrence of the species. “I nearly fell off my chair,” he said. That was two years ago and, on a visit to scour the coast, he failed to find any himself. But after receiving another report, Smyth conducted a systematic survey in May and June this year, and discovered 41 live oysters scattered around the coast. It’s a boost to biodiversity in the lough, since oysters filter seawater and their shells provide a habitat for many other sea creatures including tiny worms, snails, algae and anemones. Smyth and his colleagues published details of the discovery in the Regional Studies in Marine Science journal. They reveal that some of the oysters, based on estimates of their age, might have been living in the lough for a decade. “The big question is, how did they get there?” Smyth said. One theory suggested by the researchers is that sediment moved to Belfast Lough from the Irish Sea perhaps contained young oysters, which then went on to establish a small population in the area. Belfast is an increasingly busy port and it is also possible that the regular washing effect caused by ships’ wakes has reduced the amount of sediment along the lough shore to levels suitable for oyster reproduction. They prefer a seafloor littered with shells and low in sediment, according to Joanne Preston at the University of Portsmouth, who was not involved in the research. “I think it’s really interesting,” she said of the oysters’ return, adding: “The take-home message is, if you create the environmental conditions … then the species will be able to establish there again.” The oysters, still scarce in the lough, would probably require intervention from conservationists if they are to thrive, said Smyth. Because of this, and the possibility that the shellfish may contain pollutants, he cautioned against members of the public gathering and eating them. In principle, however, the lough could one day be home to a future oyster fishery right near Northern Ireland’s capital, he added. The return of oysters was encouraging, said Lynn Gilmore at the Seafish Northern Ireland Advisory Committee, an industry group. She also happened upon one of the oysters while out walking this April, and told Smyth about her find. She said that 40 years ago the water quality was very different: “I remember my granny letting us go swimming in Belfast Lough – and coming out with tar on our feet and her having to clean it off with butter.”"
"For about a year, McKinnon and Quinta have been watching a flock of sheep in a nature reserve in western Victoria. But the two Maremma dogs aren’t really there to look after 146 sheep. They’re there to protect 20 tiny eastern barred bandicoots in an ingenious trial to help bring the species back from the brink of extinction. Two weeks ago, the bandicoots were released from breeding programs into the fenced 50-hectare reserve to stop the bandicoots from escaping. But the fencing won’t stop feral foxes, a key threat to the bandicoots, from moving through the area. Conservationists hope the presence of McKinnon, a four-year-old male, and Quinta, a three-year-old female, will stop the foxes attacking the bandicoots. Zoos Victoria threatened species biologist Dr Amy Coetsee says the dogs have been trained since they were puppies to ignore bandicoots and bond with the sheep. “These dogs aren’t great pets – they like to have a job,” says Coetsee. “They’re big shaggy beautiful animals, but they will create what we call a landscape of fear.” The idea to use the dogs as guardians comes from a project at Middle Island in south-west Victoria, where Maremma dogs protect Little Penguins during breeding season. Coetsee said: “The dog is a bigger predator than the fox. It doesn’t necessarily stop the foxes moving through, but it makes them more cautious and they won’t stop to look for prey.” Eastern barred bandicoots only exist in protected reserves, such as fox-free French Island, and are extinct on Australia’s mainland. Zoos Victoria guardian dog coordinator David Williams said some of the bandicoots might not survive the move back to a natural habitat, but the presence of the dogs should change the behaviour of foxes enough to give the bandicoots a fighting chance. The dogs are monitored and fed regularly and all three species – sheep, dog and bandicoot – should be able to share the same grassy habitat. Coetsee said a measure of success would be if the 10 female and 10 male bandicoots started to breed. Guardian dogs could turn out to be a cheaper and friendlier solution to feral foxes than having to build long fox-proof fencing. Zoos Victoria is working with the University of Tasmania and the National Trust of Australia, which owns the reserve, on the trial. There are 35 remote cameras on the reserve. The dogs are fitted with GPS trackers and the bandicoots have lightweight radio transmitters attached to their tails. Coetsee said the bandicoots, that weight only about 750g, would once have thrived in the area. The digging action of bandicoots helps soil health and seed distribution, said Coetsee. “They’re a pretty amazing and resilient animal and they should be here.” Conservation efforts to save the bandicoot started in the late 1980s, with captive breeding programs and releases into safe havens on islands helping to stop the species going extinct. If the Skipton trial works there are plans to release more bandicoots into other areas with guardian dogs in 2021."
" Unions have mounted a legal push for casual fruit pickers to be paid a minimum of $25 an hour, putting an end to farmers paying as little as $3 an hour under piece rate arrangements. The Australian Workers’ Union on Tuesday afternoon applied to the industrial umpire, the Fair Work Commission, to change the Horticulture Award to introduce a minimum pay rate. The Horticulture Award currently allows farmers to pay workers either a piece rate, according to how much fruit they pick, or an hourly rate. A series of inquiries and reports have exposed exploitation in the fruit-picking industry, which is staffed largely by offshore labour including Pacific Islanders and backpackers. Last week, a report by the McKell Institute, commissioned by the AWU, found some blueberry pickers were being paid as little as $3 an hour, and alleged systematic wage theft by labour hire firms the union says now dominate the industry. Walton said the industry was rife with problems including physical violence, harassment and passports being taken away from overseas workers. “It’s become the centrepiece for exploitation in this country,” he said. He said the minimum pay rate would stop growers ripping off workers by reducing the piece rate when work was easier – something he said he saw on a visit to a blueberry farm. “In certain strips of blueberry plantations some had grown more than the others,” he said. “If you got a bountiful strip they’d doctor the rate. “If the industry is so focused on having piece rates in place, that’s completely fine. But don’t use piece rates as a way of undercutting what is already the lowest award rate in the country.” Under the AWU’s proposed amendment, employers would still be allowed to pay piece rates. However, they would be required to pay the award’s current minimum hourly rate – which is the same as the minimum wage – no matter how little fruit was picked. For casuals – the vast majority of fruit-pickers – that would be $24.80 an hour. Permanent employees would be required to be paid $19.84 an hour. “Piecework rates are persistently set at levels which do not enable a competent employee to earn the minimum hourly rate,” the AWU said in its submission to the FWC. Walton said that fruit farmers depended on foreign workers arranged by labour hire firms. The AWU last tried to change the award to put a floor under piece rates in 2009, but was defeated by employers. The chief executive of the National Farmers Federation, Tony Mahar, said the organisation would “reserve comment until we see the detail of the AWU’s proposal”. “However it must be stressed that when properly used, piece rates reward productivity and no change to the award can be allowed to compromise that position,” he said."
"In June 1975, a small group of activists set off from the coast of California in an 85ft boat. They were headed for the Dalniy Vostok factory ship, which was at sea conducting business as usual: harpooning sperm whales. The activists were members of Greenpeace, an organisation that had only recently been founded, in Vancouver in 1971, and they were setting out to meet the Russian whaling ship under the banner of what would become one of the most famous slogans of the environmental movement, Save the Whales. They thought they knew what to expect. Inspired by the Canadian ecologist and writer Farley Mowat, who had explained that commercial whaling was taking some species close to extinction, Greenpeace had decided to make saving whales a key part of its mission – specifically to photograph the reality of commercial whaling at sea, which few people had ever witnessed. But what they saw when the Dalniy Vostok came into view was a shock nonetheless. “There was blood all over the water, there were dead whales in the water, and there was a large pipe that came out from the hull of the factory ship that was running constantly with blood,” says Rex Weyler, co-founder of Greenpeace. “We could see the giant slabs of whale being ripped off the bone. There was the stench of dead whales and blood, and there were sharks in the water. It was a horror show.” Amid the carnage, Wexler and activists including Paul Watson, who went on to found the campaign group Sea Shepherd, attempted to slow the whale hunt by placing themselves between the live animals and the harpooners, and took photos. But they also tried something unexpected of their own. Using an onboard sound system, they began to blast an eerie noise: whale song, taken from the 1970 album, Songs of the Humpback Whale. Produced by marine biologist Dr Roger Payne from audio of male humpbacks singing off the coast of Bermuda, Songs of the Humpback Whale had been a surprise hit with the public, and remains the only multiplatinum-selling album of animal sounds. It also announced a scientific breakthrough: Payne and his team had found that whales don’t just call but actually sing to each other, in slowly repeating patterns. The success of the album had been one of the reasons Greenpeace chose whaling as an early focus in the first place. By the early 1970s, public understanding had advanced to the point that whales became animals that “people internationally could all relate to”, says Weyler. “Whales are intelligent. They have families. And they even, we learned at that time, make music and vocalise. The whale was the perfect species in danger that could stand for all of wild nature.” As the activists turned on the loudspeakers to blast it at the Dalniy Vostok, they also hoped whale song could be a language that could cross boundaries. “We came right up beside the giant ship. The crew lined the rails of three decks, towering above us,” recalls Weyler of the moment when they played the music. “It was quite dramatic. They waved and shouted and hooted. They seemed, to tell you the truth, quite friendly and interested in us. “And they were fascinated by the whale sound. Very few of the crew on the boat were actually whalers and harpooners. There were people working in the kitchens, boathands, people who were cutting up and processing the whales dragged on board.” The effect was profound. Although the harpooners did not stop whaling that day, Greenpeace had scored a success. The anti-whaling movement would go on to transform world opinion, paving the way for the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) 1982 decision to ban commercial whaling starting in 1986 – of which Russia, along with Japan, was one of the biggest proponents. The Dalniy Vostok would eventually cease whaling and became a fishing trawler. (In 2015, it sank off the coast of Russia, killing most of the crew.) Whale populations began to rise, and have done so – with some exceptions – ever since. As of May 2020, humpback whale populations had returned to 93% of their pre-whaling size. But in 2020, 50 years on from the release of the album, whales are once again in the global headlines for all the wrong reasons. A new series of threats to whales have appeared. Commercial whaling has started to return, with Norway and Japan among the countries that have abandoned the IWC ban. And whaling is the least of it. Collisions with ships, bycatch from fishing, habitat loss due to the climate emergency and a global plastic pollution crisis are hitting whales from all directions on a scale unknown in the 1970s. Most pernicious of all, however, is the noise. “Shipping has increased by 300% in the past two decades and noise is a massive issue,” says Helen McLachlan, fisheries programme manager for the Worldwide Fund for Nature. “Sound in the water is really important for the toothed whales like sperm whales, which use sound to identify prey and to navigate. If you upset those functions then you are undermining that animal’s ability to survive.” The deadly threat posed to whale song by shipping noise was underlined during the pandemic, when whales got a brief respite from the din. In lockdown-quietened waters, researchers were able to record whales singing with increased frequency, and at lower volumes. But with new vaccines emerging and the global economy adjusting to the pandemic restrictions, the “lockdown effect” looks set to be a blip. Fifty years since an album of whale songs brought to public attention one of the great wonders of the ocean, do we need to save the whales all over again? “When I discovered that humpbacks were singing, one of my biggest worries was, ‘well, nobody knows what a humpback whale is’,” says Payne, now 85, speaking from his home in Vermont. “The attitude that people had to whales then is very hard to conjure up in our age. It was sort of, ‘uh-huh’. People knew whales were very big, and that was about it.” He first heard whales singing in the late 1960s, on tapes made by a US navy engineer, Frank Watlington. Watlington had been listening out for explosions off the coast of Bermuda, but was surprised to find the noises obscured by the sound of whales calling to each other. Using military hydrophones, he recorded the whale vocalisations at rare length. A whale enthusiast himself, Watlington recognised the recordings’ potential significance, and passed them to two visiting marine biologists: Payne and his then wife, Katy. We still don’t know all the reasons that baleen whales sing, but it is thought to be how male humpbacks advertise their location and credentials to potential mates. Katy Payne, a researcher in acoustic biology at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, used the recordings to prove that male humpbacks sing the same songs together in groups, and gradually compose new ones, changing their songs each year. Females are thought to be attracted to males singing the most “current” songs. If it was a breakthrough to realise that the whales could sing, perhaps as remarkable was discovering how emotionally involving the songs of these vast marine mammals are to human ears. “Something about their sounds knocked me out, inspired a sense of wonder, just a ‘wow’ reaction,” recalls Roger Payne of hearing the recordings for the first time, and realising they could help draw public attention to whales. “It felt obvious to me that this is the way that we can capture people’s imagination.” Payne produced the album from Watlington’s audio and released it commercially as Songs of the Humpback Whale. The album was a hit. National Geographic magazine gave it a further boost by distributing 10.5m promotional copies. Payne says he has seen crowds of 200 people burst into tears on hearing it. “The definition of a song is simply a repeated rhythmic pattern,” he says, but whale song transmits “a message that gets to other levels of your brain than the songs of most animals. “Some of the laws of musical composition of humpbacks’ songs are the same as in human music,” he notes. “Whales, for example, use sonata form: the establishment of a theme and then a variation, then a return. Well, how the hell do you explain that? My suspicion is that music probably vastly predates our species.” What’s more, Katy Payne and her colleague Linda Guinee would go on to prove that humpback songs also use the equivalent of “rhyme”: consistent end-note sounds to the most complex sections, thought to be a mnemonic device to help the whales memorise the longest songs. Songs of the Humpback Whale heralded a cultural shift, as awareness of whales’ intriguingly human-like qualities became widespread. The “great whales” – including humpbacks and blue whales – became awe-inspiring wildlife icons, a status that is now self-evident. They were also in unparalleled danger. Commercial whaling had existed since the 1800s, but by the mid-1960s it was happening on a mass scale around the world. It was largely through the efforts of Greenpeace that the public began to realise the threats posed to whales, after the activists returned from their shocking encounter with the Dalniy Vostok. “It was a really traumatising experience for all of us on the Greenpeace ship,” says Weyler, speaking from his home on Cortes Island, British Columbia. “We had never seen anything like that.” Still, he credits that trip and the resulting photographs for beginning to change public opinion. “We were aware that just explaining that the whales were being hunted would not be enough to get the attention of global policymakers and media. By confronting the whalers and bringing the pictures of the horror of the slaughter, that’s what shocked the world – and brought ecology into the modern era.” In 1974, a 14-year-old girl named Maris Sidenstecker was one of those shocked. The teenager, from Los Angeles, had come across an article in an inflight magazine explaining the new existential threat to blue whales. “I just could not get it out of my mind,” says Sidenstecker, now a marine biologist. Inspired, she designed and printed a T-shirt with her drawing of a blue whale and the words, “Save the whales”. People began to ask her where they could buy one and soon, through a small ad in Rolling Stone magazine, Sidenstecker was shipping T-shirts nationwide. “That’s when we really started selling a lot more,” she says, “boxes and boxes of them.” At the age of 16, Sidenstecker founded a charity, Save The Whales, which she still runs today. It was official: saving whales was mainstream, and the anti-whaling campaign went worldwide. “Later, we confronted the whalers in the mid-Pacific around Hawaii and then, even later Greenpeace, Sea Shepherd and other organisations confronted whaling fleets in the South Pacific and South Atlantic,” recalls Weyler. “It became a global movement.” By the 1980s, as the IWC ban came into effect and populations began slowly to recover, crowding on to the deck of a boat to catch a glimpse of a whale’s back became a life-affirming way to spend leisure time. “Whale-watching was something I pushed right from the start,” says Payne, “because if you see a whale up close you’re not going to forget it.” The 1986 film Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home captured the zeitgeist with its story of saving humpback whales in San Francisco Bay. Save the Whales had become – along with the effort to reduce the hole in the ozone layer – perhaps the greatest environmental success story of the 20th century. Incidentally, Sidenstecker never claimed to have invented the phrase “save the whales”. Greenpeace chose it independently for its campaign, and in a 2015 interview with NPR, Katy Payne remembered Watlington telling them, “Go and save the whales”. At one point Sidenstecker attempted to register the name for her charity. “We did try to trademark the name about 20 years ago,” she says from her home in whale-rich Monterey Bay, California. “We were told to forget it. It’s a phrase in the public domain now that everyone uses.” Just as the world thought whales were saved, however, new threats began to emerge. In 1993, just seven years after the IWC whaling ban, Norway broke from the agreement and resumed commercial whaling; it is still the world’s biggest killer of whales. Japan abandoned the agreement in 2018. Iceland, too, is also still whaling, though there are signs that the practice might be coming to an end as whale-watching tourism makes better economic sense. Still, commercial whaling pales in comparison to the death toll in what is known as “bycatch”. Whales are frequently entangled in fishing gear, such as lines joining equipment on the seabed to surface buoys, or killed while fishers are hunting other species. Worldwide, bycatch kills as many as 300,000 whales, dolphins and porpoises every year, making it by far the biggest killer of cetaceans. According to the WWF, bycatch led to the recent extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin in China, and is a critical threat to endangered North Atlantic right whales and Arabian Sea humpback whales, among many other cetacean species. Another threat is from commercial shipping, particularly collisions. “Vessels are getting bigger and travelling more quickly, which makes them a key threat to whales,” says McLachlan. Whales struck by ships often die, and a recent study  suggested that speed limits don’t always help: even slow-moving boats are likely to kill endangered right whales in a collision. But the most poignant new threat of all, given the profound impact of Songs of the Humpback Whale, must be the disruption of their song caused by the noise from commercial shipping, which has had a direct effect on whale populations. “It’s about communication, including for breeding and between mothers and calves,” says McLachlan of whale song. “You know yourself that if you’re in a crowded pub. You have to shout to be heard, and it’s exhausting after a while.” Some scientists also speculate that commercial shipping noise may be altering the content of the whale songs. Michelle Fournet of Cornell University hypothesises that whale song may be richer and more complex when human-generated noise abates, as it did during the pandemic, when reduced shipping activity briefly allowed humpbacks to benefit from the clearer singing conditions. That effect is not likely to last, however. Some solutions are being sought, such as responsive shipping routes plotted to avoid areas where whales are likely to be breeding, feeding or migrating. In Canada’s Bay of Fundy, “shipping lanes were moved for right whales, and they returned to areas they had vacated”, says McLachlan. “There is even whale-avoidance software that vessels can operate.” In October 2020, blue whale song was also found to change during migratory journeys, with a Stanford University study showing that whales’ switch from night-time to daytime singing as they start to migrate – potentially another way to better predict whales’ migration routes, and thus help reduce collisions. Similarly, with bycatch, technological innovation could help lower casualties from fishing equipment with, for example, remote collection of lobster traps rather than lines attached to a buoy on the surface. Many of the threats cannot be solved with technology, however. Critical habitat loss and the plastic pollution crisis are threats for which taking action after the fact is often too little, or too late, or simply impossible. For example, once toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) had entered the food chain, banning them did not change that fact. They are still found in orcas off Scotland. “It is key for overall ocean health that we have a healthy, dynamic population of these top predators,” says McLachlan. She adds that, because whales store tonnes of carbon dioxide in their bodies, they are also key to mitigating the climate crisis. If whales are threatened, it’s bad news for all of us. Roger Payne’s obsession with what he calls “whale speak” continues to inform his research. As well as discovering that some whales sing, another breakthrough was calculating just how far some great whales can hear. In deep ocean (and, he adds, in a pre-human-noise-pollution world), “I was shocked to calculate that blue whales and fin whales could hear each other as far as 13,000 miles away.” But it’s the languid musicality of whale song itself that connected with so many people. Otherworldly in the truest sense, it predates humans by tens of millions of years. There is something else that plays on Payne’s mind, something he has never been able to prove, and probably never will. “My suspicion is that the difference between whale communication and human communication may be that they are transmitting emotions directly,” he says. “We can’t do that. We need words.”"
"The willow tit has become Britain’s fastest declining resident bird, and one of half a dozen imperilled woodland species, according to the definitive survey of the country’s birds. Numbers of the diminutive tit, a subspecies unique to the UK, have plummeted by 94% since 1970, and by a third since 2008. The willow tit, which lives in dense birch thickets close to wetlands or water, has almost entirely vanished from south-east England and now survives mainly in post-industrial sites such as former coalmines, north-east of Derbyshire. Woodland birds have slumped by 27% since the 1970s and are continuing to dramatically decline, falling by 7% over the past five years, according to the new report. The breeding populations of five rare forest-dwelling species – lesser spotted woodpecker, lesser redpoll, spotted flycatcher, capercaillie and marsh tit – are now less than a quarter of what they were 50 years ago. Fiona Burns, lead author of the report produced by the RSPB, the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT) together with the government’s nature conservation bodies, said: “The UK’s birds are telling us that nature is in retreat. The continuing losses seen across many species are not sustainable and more needs to be done to stop the declines and help populations revive and recover.” According to Mark Eaton, principal conservation scientist at the RSPB, the willow tit’s decline is caused by a burgeoning wild deer population eating out dense thickets and the scrubby under-storey of many woodlands, the drying out of soils caused by the climate crisis, and the fragmentation of woods because of developments such as housing, new roads, and new railways. All three trends are particularly pronounced in the south-east. While a few woodland species such as goldcrest can survive in non-native conifer plantations, such new forests – being planted in part to offset carbon emissions – will not help the declining birds. “The easiest solution to our lack of trees is a very poor solution for these struggling birds,” said Eaton. The Breeding Bird Survey also shows a continuing decline for “farmland” birds, including Britain’s fastest declining bird, the migratory turtle dove. Farmland birds have continued to decline by 5% between 2013 and 2018 with an overall decline of 45% on 1970 populations. But Eaton said the prognosis for farmland birds was more hopeful, with conservation science better understanding the reasons for their declines, and agri-environment schemes – where farmers are paid for nature-friendly practices – being scientifically proven to boost bird numbers. With the government promising that its new post-Brexit farm support, the Environmental Land Management Scheme (Elms), will provide money for farming that produces “public goods” such as healthy soils and wildlife-rich countryside, Eaton said there were “reasons to be cautiously optimistic”. “We know agri-environment schemes work,” he said. “It’s having them at sufficient scale across enough farms to really turn things around at a population level. Certainly in England there’s the potential for that scale to be achieved [with Elms].” One thriving farmland bird is the wood pigeon, which is singlehandedly responsible for the biomass of native British birds actually rising since the late 1960s, despite the loss of 19 million pairs of native birds, to leave a population of 83 million native pairs. Smaller birds have declined in number – 10.7 million pairs of house sparrows have vanished – but the wood pigeon has added 3,300 tonnes of biomass to the UK total of 20,000 tonnes. The wood pigeon has prospered with the intensification of arable farming, fattening up on winter-sown crops and oilseed rape. According to Eaton, Britain’s bird populations show signs of “biotic homogenisation”, which means there are fewer species thriving but some adaptable “generalist” species such as wood pigeons are thriving, while species with very particular needs, such as willow tits, are disappearing. Britain’s 83 million pairs of native birds are joined each summer by 57 million non-native pheasants and partridges, which are released to be shot. While fieldfares and golden orioles are close to becoming extinct as breeding birds in Britain – not helped by global heating pushing their natural ranges northwards – there is some good news. Climate warming has helped large waterbirds colonise Britain, with cattle egrets now following little egrets, little bitterns and spoonbills to breed successfully, helped by improved legal protections for the birds and their wetland habitats. Populations of some of Britain’s rarer breeding birds have also increased, with cirl buntings, stone-curlews and corncrakes responding to targeted conservation action."
"Rain returns in the fretting hours, beating against panes of dream. Early traffic splashes down from Broseley, birds stay hunched in roosts. When the weather breaks, they sally out in the first damp glimmer. At dawn, behind horizon clouds, what is not fire burns what is not day. Sunlight of the new normal is a cool, rinsed thing that draws something not-normal from the water. A mist rises from ponds and brooks. It flows uphill, pale and smoky, following the old green rut of a track, hollowed and abandoned generations ago. What looks like a pasture with a few tall lime trees and a cluster of thorns was once a place of wilder festive gatherings. The mist moves up it with direction and purpose as a processional breath, to pool in open ground beyond the trees. The day is over quickly and leaves little of itself behind but the tinkling of goldcrests in the ivy and the echoes of gunshots. Dusk is filthy with mud and mystery. On the hill, against a moony lustre in the south-west, there is the slight of a buzzard gliding darker than the edge of trees – a thought just beyond sight. So, whistle. Whistle it back. The buzzard mews, and although the sounds are so unlike, here it comes, turning short spirals in the lighter air, lifting on the central-heating updraught above school buildings towards the hill until it’s overhead. In a breeze through year’s end, the buzzard takes a speculative turn to inspect the whistler, then without pause or wing movement, swings over pines and the cold quarry hole north. Along the lane it is still mild enough for bats to thread laceholes between trees, and the spirit claps for the almost-touch of wings and ultrasound grins of them. Three tawny owls, one in the wood, one in the lane, one in the field, shake their calls out, triangulating a position. The lane owl, silhouetted in an ash tree, throws its head forward and hoots three times. It retreats into the dark with the studied urgency of a quarry blaster who has lit the fuse in a drill hole of black powder."
"The “ugliest orchid in the world”, a toadstool discovered at Heathrow airport, and a bizarre scaly shrub have topped a list of new species named by scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and their collaborators in 2020. The researchers said the 156 new plants and fungi highlighted the amazing diversity of species that remain to be found, with the potential to provide new crops, medicines and gardener’s favourites. One is a morning glory plant, whose sweet purple tubers are already eaten by local people in the high Andes of Peru. A third of the new species are orchids, but one confounded the family’s reputation for great beauty, with RGB Kew calling it the “ugliest in the world”. The plant – Gastrodia agnicellus – was found in a national park in Madagascar and its 11mm flowers are brown, fleshy and grotesque, and are likely to be pollinated by flies. The orchid remains underground in the deep shade of a humid forest most of the time, emerging only to flower, but it has “a noticeable musk rose-like scent”, the scientists said. “In a difficult year, it’s so thrilling to see botanical and mycological science continue, with a bumper list of incredible newly named species,” said Martin Cheek at RBG Kew. “There are some amazing new finds, each with their own unique qualities and potential for humanity.” “However, the bleak reality facing us cannot be underplayed: with two in five plants threatened with extinction, it is a race against time to find, identify, name and conserve plants before they disappear,” he said. There were six new webcap toadstools named in the UK in 2020, all from a genus known to be important in supporting the growth of oak, beech and birch trees. Cortinarius heatherae was discovered along the river on the boundary of Heathrow airport by the mycologist Andy Overall and named after his wife, Heather. Three were found in Scotland, one in Brighton and another in woods at Barrow-in-Furness. The strangest new species was a dwarf shrub with bizarre scaly leaves that grows in extremely hot natural salt pans in Namibia. Its name – Tiganophyton – is derived from the Greek word τηγάνι (tigani), which means frying pan. DNA analysis showed the plant is part of the cabbage order, but represents a completely new family – such discoveries are rare. Among the new orchids, 19 tree-dwelling species are from the tropical paradise island of New Guinea, one with spectacular golden orange flowers and others having hair-like tufts on their flowers. A beautiful new bromeliad discovered on a forest-shaded limestone cliff in Brazil was one of the species already under threat. The scientists believe the plant is pollinated by hummingbirds but only 25 plants were found and the extraction of limestone to make cement is a serious threat in this area. Another new species is a shrub related to blueberries found in Indonesian New Guinea, close to the world’s largest gold mine. Other finds included two new species of succulent-leaved aloe in Madagascar, which may have the medicinal benefits already known in aloe vera, and a new herb from the medicinally important plant family Apocynaceae, whose members are used to treat health issues such as flatulence, gonorrhoea, paralysis, burns, and fungal skin infections. The herb was found in the Chirinda forest of Zimbabwe but only a few plants are known to exist. One discovery did not involve scientists tramping through jungles or across mountains but was found by searching online. The spectacular Tanzanian hibiscus was found by the Australian specialist Lex Thomson, who was studying online images of historic herbarium specimens. The new plant has great potential for gardeners as it can withstand much drier conditions than the well-known Hibiscus schizopetalus."
"Microplastic particles have been revealed in the placentas of unborn babies for the first time, which the researchers said was “a matter of great concern”. The health impact of microplastics in the body is as yet unknown. But the scientists said they could carry chemicals that could cause long-term damage or upset the foetus’s developing immune system. The particles are likely to have been consumed or breathed in by the mothers. The particles were found in the placentas from four healthy women who had normal pregnancies and births. Microplastics were detected on both the foetal and maternal sides of the placenta and in the membrane within which the foetus develops. A dozen plastic particles were found. Only about 4% of each placenta was analysed, however, suggesting the total number of microplastics was much higher. All the particles analysed were plastics that had been dyed blue, red, orange or pink and may have originally come from packaging, paints or cosmetics and personal care products. The microplastics were mostly 10 microns in size (0.01mm), meaning they are small enough to be carried in the bloodstream. The particles may have entered the babies’ bodies, but the researchers were unable to assess this. “It is like having a cyborg baby: no longer composed only of human cells, but a mixture of biological and inorganic entities,” said Antonio Ragusa, director of obstetrics and gynaecology at the San Giovanni Calibita Fatebenefratelli hospital in Rome, and who led the study. “The mothers were shocked.” In the study, published in the journal Environment International, the researchers concluded: “Due to the crucial role of placenta in supporting the foetus’s development and in acting as an interface with the external environment, the presence of potentially harmful plastic particles is a matter of great concern. Further studies need to be performed to assess if the presence of microplastics may trigger immune responses or may lead to the release of toxic contaminants, resulting in harm.” The potential effects of microplastics on foetuses include reduced foetal growth, they said. The particles were not found in placentas from two other women in the study, which may be the result of different physiology, diet or lifestyle, the scientists said. Microplastics pollution has reached every part of the planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People are already known to consume the tiny particles via food and water, and to breathe them in. Their effect in the body is unknown but scientists say there is an urgent need to assess the issue, particularly for infants. In October, scientists revealed that babies fed formula milk in plastic bottles are swallowing millions of particles a day. In 2019, researchers reported the discovery of air pollution particles on the foetal side of placentas, indicating that unborn babies are also exposed to the dirty air produced by motor traffic and fossil fuel burning. The Italian researchers used a plastic-free protocol to deliver the babies in order to prevent any contamination of the placentas. Obstetricians and midwives used cotton gloves to assist the women in labour and only cotton towels were used in the delivery room. Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King’s College London, told the Daily Mail it was reassuring that the babies in the study had normal births but “it is obviously preferable not to have foreign bodies while the baby is developing”. Elizabeth Salter Green, at the chemicals charity Chem Trust, said: “Babies are being born pre-polluted. The study was very small but nevertheless flags a very worrying concern.” A separate recent study showed that nanoparticles of plastic inhaled by pregnant laboratory rats were detected in the liver, lungs, heart, kidney, and brain of their foetuses."
"The sun sets the water ablaze, creating a dazzling trail of Greek fire, the light glittering as it bounces off the breeze-ruffled surface into my squinting eyes. I wish there was some way of distilling that molten brightness and drinking it; it is such a potent antidote to the past few days, which were hardly days at all, just a few hours of sickly gloom while the valley festered under cloud and murk. December can be a squalid month: dark, muddy, windy, waterlogged. The pocket of Wharfedale where I am living is overshadowed by the Chevin escarpment, and the sun barely creeps above it at this time of year. When a bright day finally materialises, I feel a vital urge to bask in the sunlight, and will spend as much time as possible between work manoeuvring myself into the valley’s high places, open spaces and sun traps. This is one such spot: the wetland nature reserve surrounding the small lakes created by the inundation of the old gravel pits. The sight of sunlight and water together is heartening in itself, reminding us of life’s fundamentals, but this area of water, woods, rough grassland and reedbeds is also home to a busy avian community. I have seen little egrets flying above the adjacent River Wharfe, and I think I spot one today. Cormorants, coots and black-headed gulls congregate on the wildfowl lake. Best of all, for me, are the lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), which overwinter here in relatively large numbers. At one point, a hundred or so rise up from the banks of a lake and flock together in a great aerial organism; a morphing, contorting mass which recalls the shapeshifting grace of a starling murmuration, twisting and turning in apparent unison. Lapwing flight is sometimes mischaracterised as clumsy, but in this massed form they reveal enormous powers of control and coordination. As the flock’s collective mind changes from one moment to the next, so does its appearance, oscillating between the main colours of lapwing plumage – black, white, and iridescent green – as the angle of flight shifts. Up there in the cold December sun, the birds seem wild, bright and brilliant."
"Watching an American indie band is not the most obvious way to commune with a wonder of the natural world but look up Saint Simon by the Shins on YouTube. The band plays in a forest in central Mexico, surrounded by towering chandeliers of butterflies, trees full of butterflies, clouds of butterflies. It is a stunning encounter with the monarch, one of the world’s most remarkable migratory insects. Today it is tragic, too, because the video, filmed 15 years ago, is already a memento of vanished glory. Eastern monarch populations, which overwinter in Mexico, have fallen by 80% over 40 years.  Western monarchs, which over winter in California, have all but gone. In 1997, more than 1m were counted in California over Thanksgiving. Five years ago, it was 300,000. In 2020, less than 2,000 were counted. Despite this collapse, the US government has concluded that the monarch is unworthy of special protection under the Endangered Species Act. There are more urgent priorities, apparently. In Mexico, conservationists are murdered for trying to protect the monarch. Ultimately, the extinction crisis will kill us, and if we cannot take the international action required to save this wondrous creature – outlawing insect-killing pesticides and saving ancient forests – then perhaps obliteration is what we deserve."
"Australia’s wildlife are at least 20 times more likely to come across a deadly feral cat than one of the country’s native predators, according to a new study. Invasive cats, which kill billions of native animals each year, form a triple threat, the study finds, by hunting with greater intensity, in broader environments and in greater numbers than an equivalent native marsupial predator – the spotted-tailed quoll. “They eat everything and they’re in every environment,” says study author Dr Rowena Hamer. “They’re impressive, but devastating.” Feral cats have a devastating toll on Australia’s wildlife, killing an estimated 2bn animals every year and being implicated in at least 25 mammal extinctions and pressuring a further 124 threatened species. Domestic cats also kill about 230m Australian birds, reptiles and mammals each year, research has found. Hamer and colleagues attached GPS collars to 25 feral cats and 10 quolls in four locations in the middle of Tasmania and then tracked their movements. Quolls are similar in size to cats and have similar diets, hunting for small mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs. “This was about understanding why cats are so devastating, because Australia seems to have similar native predators,” said Hamer, who did the research while at the University of Tasmania, and is now a conservation ecologist at the not-for-profit Tasmanian Land Conservancy. Hamer’s results, published Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, reveal quolls are more selective and less voracious hunters than cats. Using data on the numbers of cats and quolls, the habitats they prefer, and how often they go back to the same area, the study finds native wildlife are at least 20 times as likely to encounter a cat than a quoll. Hamer said the data showed the location of the cats and quolls every five minutes over about a month for each animal, and showed some quolls travelling 12km over a few days. Across fields, the data showed how quolls sprint across open areas in a straight line. Cats have only been in the Australian environment since the late 18th century and generally native species have not found ways to avoid being killed when they come across one. The study also found there were about nine cats for every square kilometre in the area studied, but there were only 0.4 quolls. Whether in pasture, grassland, woodland or creek banks, wildlife is now more likely to come across the invasive cat than the native quoll. The Australian National University’s Prof Sarah Legge, who has researched the toll of cats on native species, said the study revealed useful and complex information on why cats were such a “superb generalist predator that native mammals struggle to evade”. Legge, who was not involved in the study, said: “We know they are targeting small- to medium-sized mammals and this study helps us understand why it’s happening and gives us some clues as to what to do about it.” One approach suggested by the study is to maintain and restore complex understorey in habitats to give native animals places to hide from cats. Feral cats were declared a pest species in 2015. Feral cats threaten some 124 nationally listed species, according to the government. The Australia government is developing a new threatened species strategy which is expected to be released later this year. The previous five-year strategy, which closed in mid-2020, included targets for cat management and culling. Some 844,000 cats were culled between July 2015 and June 2018, an interim review said."
"A landholder’s controversial plans to clear almost 2,000 hectares of native vegetation on Queensland’s Cape York were denied after he rejected government advice that it would put five threatened species at risk. Kingvale station owner Scott Harris, who wanted to clear the land for cropping, had also refused to pay for ecological surveys before clearing, according to a detailed statement provided to environmental campaigners by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, and seen by the Guardian. Guardian Australia revealed in December 2020 that Ley had rejected the plan to clear eucalypt forest and melaleuca swamps in a catchment running into the Great Barrier Reef. Ley released a statement of reasons to the Wilderness Society on 24 December with details about the process and her decision. In the statement, Ley said she was ready to allow the application with conditions, but Harris “had not given his consent to these conditions”. Ley’s refusal under Australia’s national environment laws was a rare example of a minister using the national powers to deny a development application. The power has been used just 24 times since the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act came into force in 2000. Campbell Newman’s Queensland government had granted a permit for the Kingvale clearing in 2014, but the plan was referred to the federal government to assess its likely environmental impacts. Environmental campaigners successfully went to court in 2018 to force a more comprehensive assessment of the Kingvale plan. Environment groups lined up to oppose the plan, encouraging more than 6,000 public submissions. Ley wrote that the clearing would be likely to have a significant impact on five species: the bare-rumped sheathtail bat, northern quoll, golden-shouldered parrot, antbed parrot moth and red goshawk. To protect the species, Ley wanted surveys carried out before any clearing took place, and an offset area identified, with a management plan that would improve habitat. Harris had offered not to clear trees on an area of the property the same size as that being cleared, but Ley’s statement said Harris did not propose to manage the area. In the statement, Ley said there had been “considerable correspondence” between Harris’s legal representative and the government. Ley wrote that as a result, she understood Harris’s position was that there was no evidence that any matters of national environmental significance existed on the property, or that clearing would have any impact on threatened species. Harris was not able to consent to the offset conditions, Ley wrote, and he had not agreed to pay for pre-clearance surveys. Ley had invited Harris to a meeting with her and environment department staff, but Harris “did not take up these invitations”, she wrote. Ley wrote that without mitigation, the clearing would have contributed a “substantial new and ongoing source of pollutants”, with fertilisers, sediment and pesticides going downstream into the Great Barrier Reef’s waters. The area proposed for the clearing drains into two rivers – the Hann and Kennedy – which run for 200km before reaching the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park at Princess Charlotte Bay. Ley said the Queensland government’s development permit required erosion mitigation measures, but she wanted further steps, including soil conservation, groundcover maintenance and sediment management. Gemma Plesman, a senior campaigner at the Wilderness Society, said it was estimated there were fewer than 1,500 golden-shouldered parrots left in the wild, and Kingvale had habitat suited to the bird. She said: “The fact that our system would even assess and consider the destruction of suitable habitat in the first place is preposterous.” She said surveys found termite mounds that the parrot and the northern quoll used for shelter, which would have been bulldozed. The fact that Ley was willing to allow the plan subject to offsets exposed a flaw in national environment laws, Plesman said. “Any system that would have allowed the destruction of mature habitat for endangered species will continue to lock in the loss of those species. “Our federal environment laws need to be strengthened so that old growth and important forest for endangered species like the golden shouldered parrot are off limits from destruction.” Representatives for Harris did not respond to email, text and voicemail messages requesting comment."
"Perched on a tussocky slope, we eat our sandwiches in the winter sun, sit-mats sinking into damp moss among leaves of betony and St John’s wort. Heather stems nudge against my knees. Young hawthorns make a spiky canopy above my head. Through backlit stalks of knapweed, a field lies way below us, held in a crook of the Warksburn. The far side of the river is bordered by a cliff seen through a lattice of riparian alders. Atop that is a sheep field and above that the wide Northumberland sky. The Warksburn gathers water from a series of sikes or rills – including Nameless Sike – in the south-east corner of Kielder Forest. It’s a crimped blue line on the map like a pulled thread from a knitted jumper, twisting and looping through boggy ground between mist-caught ranks of conifers. Nearby, there are signs of the farming past in the shielings, stells and stack stands: shepherds’ huts, circular sheepfolds and mounds for drying fodder for winter. Passing the forestry village of Stonehaugh, the river winds through upland country sprinkled with names drawn from the land: Standingstone Clints, Lousy Bog, Cowcrook Moss and Boggly Burn. The Black Pool is deep and dark. By the long abandoned house of Low Roses Bower, there’s a netty called the Long Drop. A small stone building on the crag’s edge and 12 metres above the burn, it was in use until the 1950s. Past Roaring Hole waterfall, past settlements and peles, past a former watermill and through ribbons of woodland, the river descends to join the North Tyne. Running through what were once the unruly Debatable Lands, it inspired a 19th-century fiddle tune, the Warksburn Waltz. The great Northumberland forests are woven into the recent audio tales of the November Club, a local performing arts charity; the stories in Lost, Found and Told are united by a soundscape of moving water. We too find inspiration, sitting on the riverbank, sketchbooks held in cold hands, pencil and pen feeling for the lines of trees, the smooth curve of a natural weir. This was one of the first places that I discovered when I moved to Northumberland. At this difficult time, I feel calmed by the continuity of its flow and the history it carries with it."
"Just before the 2008 Olympics, a machine on the roof of the US embassy in Beijing began to tweet air pollution measurements to the world. The numbers that appeared each hour were often shocking but they demonstrated the power of objective measurement. The resulting response has led to huge improvements in air quality for much of the vast Chinese population. Globally, particle pollution contributed to an estimated 4.1 million early deaths in 2019, but 141 of the world’s 234 countries had no regular measurements. If you live in the US, Canada or western Europe, your average distance to a monitoring site is just over 20km (12 miles). This seems a long way to give an understanding of the air in your local street but in central Africa the average distance is more than 1,000km. Satellite data can help but it is hard to resolve pollution in the lowest part of the atmosphere where we live. Computer models can combine satellite data with the location pollution sources and the sparse measurements, but this data is not good enough to tell us how air pollution changes day to day and in response to cleanup initiatives. There is an urgent need for more pollution measurements around the world."
"Leading scientists have warned that global conservation is being undermined by celebrity power after they suffered death threats and abuse in a hostile dispute over trophy hunting. Groups such as the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting and Born Free are pressuring the UK and US governments to ban trophy hunting, with support from many famous names, much of the public and more than 150 MPs across the political spectrum. Many of them signed an open letter calling for a ban, which scientists say contained misleading information. Several scientists told the Guardian that poor political decision-making and abuse directed at them are being fuelled by what they describe as “myths driven by emotion and morality that ignore critical facts”. They also warn that well-meaning but ill-informed campaigning on the emotive issue risks imperilling millions of acres of wildlife habitat and African livelihoods. Although poorly regulated trophy hunting has had a negative impact historically on some wildlife populations, there is wide evidence, including from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), that for many threatened species such as the black rhino, white rhino, lion and markhor, well-regulated trophy hunting has brought population increases and reduced larger threats. Conservationists say that when habitats are managed for hunting, it can protect many other endangered species living in the same area. In 2019, 133 leading scientists and community representatives warned in a letter to the journal Science that banning hunting without implementing viable alternatives to protect habitat and generate revenue for local communities would imperil biodiversity. The scientists involved say this has led to a wave of abuse, including from anti-hunting campaign groups and celebrities. Dr Amy Dickman, a lion conservationist from Oxford University who has received funding from both pro- and anti-hunting groups, was the first author on the Science letter and said she had received numerous verbal attacks. The actor and animal welfare campaigner Peter Egan called her “a very limited scientist”, while others accused her of being a “paid mouthpiece” for hunting or called her “a monster” and “a twisted sadistic bitch”. Dickman claims another said they would love to see her face ripped off by lions. She was also asked to leave a meeting in parliament of politicians, activists and the media arranged by the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting. She is not alone: other signatories to the letter have reported similar abuse. The scientists say such attacks deter people from pointing out when misleading information is being spread. Adam Hart, professor of science communication at the University of Gloucestershire, said: “A lot of conservation scientists are scared to get involved in this debate as it is so toxic. I have had people call me a shill for the hunting industry, which is absolute twaddle. We get personal slurs against our professional integrity just for trying to engage people with the science, and trying to limit the wildlife loss that will come if trophy hunting is banned.” Born Free in the US and the UK Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting both say trophy hunting does not support conservation. Dickman said: “The campaigners’ narrative – suggesting trophy hunting is driving species to extinction and banning it will make things better – is false. I am unaware of any species where current trophy hunting is the primary threat to their persistence. The major threats are overwhelmingly habitat loss, poaching, prey loss and conflict with humans – all of which will be worsened if land used for trophy hunting is converted to agriculture or settlement. She added: “I can completely sympathise with how those images of grinning hunters turn peoples’ stomachs – they do the same to me – but the kinds of killings we see in areas where wildlife has no economic value are even worse.” Many red-listed species and their habitats are assessed by the IUCN as being supported to some extent upon by trophy hunting, including the giant eland, black rhino, white rhino, African elephant and lesser kudu. A UN report found that trophy hunting is conserving millions of acres of wildlife habitat in sub-Saharan Africa. Kenya’s 1977 ban on hunting was followed by declines of 70-88 % in some wildlife species monitored, including the warthog, lesser kudu, Thomson’s gazelle, eland, oryx and impala, while livestock increased substantially. Tanzania lost anti-poaching units and millions of acres of hunting areas after elephant trophy hunting imports were banned in the US. More than a million people signed a 2020 petition presented to Downing Street to ban trophy hunting imports, and the results of a government consultation are pending. In July, more than 50 African community leaders, who say they represent the views of millions of people across southern Africa, signed an open letter criticising British celebrities for using their influence to drive bans on trophy hunting – naming Ricky Gervais, Joanna Lumley, Peter Egan, Ed Sheeran, Dame Judi Dench and Piers Morgan. They asked them “to stop undermining our globally recognised conservation efforts and our basic human right to sustainably use the natural resources on which our communities’ livelihoods depend.” They added: “Imposing worldviews and value systems from faraway places, amplified through your powerful, influential voices, results in disastrous policies that undermine our rights and conservation success.” Dickman agreed: “I find it strange that people listen more to actors and comedians than to trained conservation scientists, or more importantly, to local stakeholders.” Born Free’s head of policy, Dr Mark Jones, said: “Trophy hunting is an emotive issue. Nevertheless, Born Free does not condone abuse of any kind.” He added: “We challenge the claims made by proponents of trophy hunting that it delivers significant conservation and community benefits, or that it positively contributes to the sustainable use of wildlife. Trophy hunting is a cruel relic of a colonial era that results in intense animal suffering and disruption of wildlife populations, while contributing little or nothing to local economies or wildlife conservation. It is also wracked by corruption and greed.” The Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting did not respond to requests for comment."
"A coalition of NGOs is calling for an urgent ban on destructive bottom trawling in EU marine protected areas, after the failure of member states to defend seas. The ban is part of a 10-point action plan to “raise the bar” to achieve biodiversity targets, which they say will not be met by current promises, such as last year’s high-profile pledge by world leaders at the UN summit on biodiversity in New York to reverse nature loss by 2030.  A raft of EU laws to safeguard marine life – including a duty on EU member states to achieve “good environmental status” in seas by 2020, to achieve healthy ecosystems and to introduce sustainable fisheries management – have not been enforced, says the group, which includes Oceana in Europe, Greenpeace and ClientEarth. They warn that this failure, combined with existing pressures on Europe’s seas, including climate change, risks triggering irreversible changes to the ecological conditions under which humanity has evolved and thrived. The 10-point call to action, which the groupwill present to EU leaders, MEPs and member states, follows the commitment of Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission, and many EU heads of state or government, to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.  The call was published in response to a European parliament draft report on the EU’s biodiversity strategy for 2030. That draft report, which will be presented to the environment committee on Thursday, expresses strong regret that the EU has “neither fully met the 2020 biodiversity strategy objectives nor the global Aichi biodiversity targets”. While the NGOs welcomed the draft report, they said it does not go far enough to ensure enforcement of current EU laws or to set action plans to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. Rebecca Hubbard, programme director of Our Fish, which aims to end overfishing, said: “The EU has failed to achieve good environmental status for EU seas and the EU biodiversity strategy must be implemented if we are to have a chance of saving it – this implementation needs to include the 10 action points we have in our report.” She said the EU has also failed to end overfishing, and to protect marine habitats from bottom trawling. “What we really need to do is go from strategies and goals to action and outcomes. National pledges, goals and agreements are important for setting a direction but if we are going to save the planet we need action.” The 10-point action plan calls for a network of fully and highly protected ocean sanctuaries covering at least 30% of the oceans by 2030 and a drastic improvement in fisheries protections. It urges the EU to commit resources to dramatically ramp up, implement and enforce existing legislation to safeguard marine life. The groups also call on the EU to carry out environmental impact assessments of fishing activities, to set fishing limits with “precautionary buffers” for climate change and mandatory remote monitoring systems for all fishing fleets. It calls for measures to mitigate bycatch and for protections of the deep sea, such as closing sensitive areas to hydrocarbon exploration. And it calls for an end to harmful fishing subsidies and controls on underwater noise. Nicolas Fournier, the campaign director for marine protection at Oceana Europe, said: “The EU 2030 biodiversity strategy is strong on marine protection targets, but we want the European parliament to raise further the EU’s ambition on biodiversity, both internationally to champion the 30% of ocean protection and support the UN treaty for the high-seas, but also in Europe to call for a ban of all destructive fishing gear inside marine protected areas, starting with bottom-trawling.” Fewer than 1% of European marine protected areas are fully off-limits to fishing. Last month, the European court of auditors warned the EU had failed to halt marine biodiversity loss in Europe’s waters and to restore fishing to sustainable levels. In 2019, the European Environment Agency found “signs of stress at all scales” and warned the current and historical use of Europe’s seas was “taking its toll” on marine ecosystems  The call for action comes just days after warnings from international scientists that the planet is facing a “ghastly future of mass extinctions, declining health and climate-disruption upheavals” that threaten human survival."
"Global sales of electric cars accelerated fast in 2020, rising by 43% to more than 3m, despite overall car sales slumping by a fifth during the coronavirus pandemic. Tesla was the brand selling the most electric cars, delivering almost 500,000, followed by Volkswagen. Sales of electric cars more than doubled in Europe, pushing the region past China as the world’s biggest market for them, according to data published on Tuesday by EV-volumes.com, a Sweden-based consultancy. Sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) made up 4.2% of the global car market, up from 2.5% in 2019. The rising sales are being driven by government policies to reduce carbon emissions, but a key factor is that electric cars are simply a better technology, said Viktor Irle, sales and marketing analyst at EV-volumes.com. Sales of electric cars did fall below 2019’s levels from March to June, at the height of the Covid-19 lockdowns, but recovered strongly after that and by December were at double the level in December 2019. A series of governments have set dates for the end of sales of fossil fuel-powered cars in the next decade or so. “The political push is still there – [governments] everywhere speak about the green recovery,” said Irle. “But the main reason for growth is simple – electric cars are a better technology. There is no noise, no pollution, better acceleration, and cheaper running costs. If people test-drive an electric car, they’re not going to go back to gasoline vehicles. The problem at the moment is that the price is a little bit higher, but the cost is really coming down as well.” Irle said the surge in sales in Europe may in part be because carmakers had to meet EU emissions targets averaged across their fleets in 2020, and may have pushed sales of low-emission vehicles more than in 2019. The relatively high purchase prices of today’s electric cars may have helped manufacturers weather the Covid-19 storm, Irle added: “The cheap car segments are always the worst hit [in recessions], because it’s not normally high-income people that buy those cars.” Tesla’s approach of selling cars directly to customers, rather than via franchised dealers, may also have helped while others’ showrooms were closed, and carmakers including Volkswagen also took up this sales approach in 2020. There are about 150 new BEV and PHEV models expected on the market in 2021. This indicates that 2021 will see continued growth, said Irle, who estimates sales of about 4.6m electric cars by the end of the year. The EV-volumes.com data showed the five highest national sales were in China (1.3m), Germany (0.4m), the US (0.3m), France and the UK (both 0.2m). However, growth in the US was only 4% in 2020, due to few new models being available. In the UK, 2020 was a record year for electric vehicle sales, according to data from the trade body SMMT, which said the sector was looking to a green recovery from poor overall sales. Sales of BEVs almost tripled in the UK, while those of PHEVs almost doubled, giving the vehicles a combined market share of 10.7%. Other non-plug-in hybrids took 18% of the market, but overall car sales were down 29%. In December 2020 BEVs and PHEVs outsold diesel cars by two to one in the UK, while the Tesla Model 3 was the UK’s top selling car that month. “The accelerated take-up [of electric vehicles] in 2020 is encouraging but a true mass market depends on a wide range of models at competitive prices,” said Steve Gooding, director of pro-motoring organisation the RAC Foundation. “The industry is delivering on the first point – there are reports that more plug-ins will be launched in the UK in 2021 than those running on petrol and diesel – but there remains an affordability gap. “Much attention also focuses on battery-powered cars as being ideal for the city, but they could be just at home in rural and remote areas where there is plenty of space for public and private recharging facilities, and a relative scarcity of forecourts selling fossil fuels, and where there is availability it comes at an inflated price.” "
"The UK has been accused of failing to honour its promise to curb shipments of plastic waste to developing countries, after it emerged Britain’s new post-Brexit regulations are less stringent than those imposed by the EU. From 1 January, shipments of unsorted plastic waste from the EU to non-OECD countries were banned. But Britain will continue to allow plastic waste to be exported to developing countries, despite a Tory party manifesto commitment to banning the practice, and promises of no regression of environmental standards post-Brexit. UK exports will now be made under a new system of “prior informed consent”, under which the importer has to agree to accept the waste, and has the opportunity to refuse it. Britain is one of the biggest producers of plastic waste in the world, second only to the US. It exports about two-thirds of its plastic waste. The EU ban and the UK’s new regulations were prompted by international rules, under the Basel convention, to tackle the global trade in plastics, which has seen wealthy nations dump contaminated plastic waste on poorer ones. The regulations came into force this month. Jim Puckett, director of the Basel Action Network, said it was known as early as April 2019 that the EU planned to ban exports of dirty and unsorted plastic waste.  “We had assumed the UK would at least follow the EU, and so it is a shock to find out now that instead they choose to have a far weaker control procedure, which can still permit exports of contaminated and difficult-to-recycle plastics to developing countries,” said Puckett. “They are talking the talk, but they have failed to walk the walk.” Puckett said about 90% of plastic waste exports come under the category of dirty and unsorted plastic waste, subject to the Basel rules. “This is the guts of the amendment. This is the stuff we see being dumped and burned in south-east Asia.” The UK shipped 7,133 metric tonnes of waste to non-OECD countries, including Malaysia, Pakistan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Turkey in September 2020 alone, according to HMRC data analysed by the organisation the Last Beach Clean Up. Yuyun Ismawati, an activist with Indonesian environmental group Nexus3 Foundation, said: “It is disturbing to see that the UK wishes to continue its waste management malpractice using developing countries as dumping grounds. In Indonesia, we have documented large amounts of imported UK plastic waste dumped and burned in farming communities by substandard recyclers who can only actually recycle a small percentage of the waste.” Indonesia was one of seven countries to request containers of UK plastic waste be sent back last year. Luke Pollard, the shadow secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, said it was time the government delivered on its pledges. “The government has made big promises to match environmental standards from Europe and to ban plastic waste exports. There can be no dither or delay. “The British people expect to see these exports banned, more recycling of materials at home and faster action on the climate crisis. It is up to ministers to deliver on their promises and fast, but this does not look good.” Waste that cannot be recycled usually ends up being illegally burned or dumped in landfills or waterways, where it finds its way into the ocean. Last month, the UN transboundary waste chief told the Guardian he hoped to see a reduction in ocean plastic within five years after the introduction of the new international rules. Tim Grabiel, environmental lawyer at the Environmental Investigation Agency, said: “We would have liked to see the UK show leadership and align with the EU in going the extra step and banning plastics to non-OECD countries. If 27 states of the EU can do it, then the UK certainly can. We hope in time the UK will reconsider its position.” While the UK’s introduction of prior informed consent for plastic waste exports will increase transparency in the notoriously lawless transboundary trade, the system is open to abuse, environmentalists say. Sam Chetan-Welsh, a Greenpeace political campaigner, said: “Our government promised to maintain or exceed EU environmental standards after Brexit, but creating a loophole to allow the dumping of our plastic trash on environments and communities bodes very badly. This is not leadership, it’s failing to do the bare minimum.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said the government had “pledged to ban the export of all plastic waste to non-OECD countries”, but did not give a timetable for action. The department said it had commissioned research to better understand existing UK plastic waste recycling capacity and would consult in due course on how to deliver its manifesto commitments."
"The energy company Origin wants to search for fossil fuels across 225,000 hectares of the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin in Queensland’s channel country – part of one of the world’s biggest free-flowing river systems. The company is waiting to hear if the Queensland government will grant the applications for 10 petroleum leases, which were submitted in July last year but have not been previously reported. The 10 blocks – covering an area about the size of the ACT – are to the east and south-east of the tiny outback town of Windorah. Several blocks straddle Cooper Creek, with one block neighbouring Lake Yamma Yamma – a nationally important wetland. Campaigners are concerned Origin could be planning to target unconventional gas resources in the area, potentially using hydraulic fracturing and multiple drill sites. Asked what was planned for the leases, the company said only that it would target “any potential hydrocarbons” if its applications were successful. Last year it was revealed an independent report commissioned in 2019 by the Queensland government, but not made public, had called for a ban on unconventional gas exploration in the region. The government is now consulting stakeholders and traditional owners to develop a new set of regulations covering the basin area. Oil and gas production has taken place in the basin since the late 1960s. A 2020 federal government assessment of the Cooper basin shows existing gasfields to the south and east of Origin’s applications. Carmel Flint, national co-ordinator for the Lock the Gate Alliance campaign group, said the energy industry was focused on developing unconventional shale gas locked up in sedimentary rock in the area. She said the Queensland government had previously committed to protect the area, in particular from unconventional gas exploration, which required more gas wells than conventional gas production. “We want to see a moratorium on all unconventional gas drilling and activities on the floodplains of the basin while the government works out the long term process to look after these areas,” Flint said. “They should not be handing out petroleum leases whilst they are undertaking consultation to protect these areas.” Prof Richard Kingsford, director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW, has been researching the floodplains of Cooper Creek for two decades. He said the Cooper Creek floodplain could bulge as wide as 80km during flood in the area of the leases. He said the basin was an “incredibly complex” system of ephemeral rivers and lakes that can go from isolated pools and dried-up channels during dry periods to rivers many kilometres wide during floods, unleashing an explosion of birds, plant and insect life. “That incredible complexity gives it incredible fragility. It’s recognised as one of the world’s last big free-flowing rivers,” he said. “The spectre of potential exploration and development on sensitive floodplain could have major environmental impacts in stopping water from going to where it’s used to going.” He said the floodplain downstream from Windorah, in the area covered by Origin’s applications, was particularly important. “It’s extraordinary by any scale,” he said. During floods the region becomes a magnet for wading birds, including migratory species from the northern hemisphere. Because the region was so flat, Kingsford said, the water moved slowly, “and any obstructions can change the course of the river”. In October the state’s deputy premier, Steven Miles, wrote to environmental campaigners at Lock the Gate Alliance promising protections for the Lake Eyre basin, which includes Cooper Creek. He said the Palaszczuk government had made a commitment in December 2019 “to ensure the protection of streams and floodplains in the Queensland section of the Lake Eyre basin by returning the protections that existed in the Wild Rivers framework”. The 2019 independent report, which was leaked and later tabled in parliament, recommended that gas wells and ponds be excluded from areas which frequently flood, and unconventional petroleum and gas production should be designated “unacceptable use” in an area that overlaps with some of the Origin lease applications. Origin is among a number of high-profile businesses to support independent MP Zali Steggal’s climate change legislation that includes a target for Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions to to reach net zero by 2050. A spokesman for Origin said in a statement the company was the majority holder of the petroleum lease applications, which he said had been made by a smaller company, Blue Energy. The spokesman said: “They are yet to be granted by the Queensland government, along with any regulatory conditions and work commitments. “Origin would adopt all regulations and put in place approved management plans, procedures and controls to protect the environment.” A statement from Queensland’s Department of Resources said the applications for the petroleum leases were “under consideration” but there was “no prescribed timeframe by which any decisions must be made”. The Department of Environment and Science said in a statement it “remains committed to working with First Nations peoples, industry, local councils, stakeholders and communities to ensure the sustainable management of the Lake Eyre basin”. Consultation to develop a new framework to cover the region was postponed in February 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the statement said, but this would “recommence soon”."
"There are many ways to be a plant. Hawthorns take their time, laying down annual growth rings before they flower, producing berries year in, year out, and surviving to a grand old age. But weeds like the goosegrass (Galium aparine) are in a hurry. They complete their ephemeral cycle of life, seed to seed, in just a few months. It is January, and already I see their seedlings shouldering aside the decaying leaves along the bottom of a bare hawthorn hedge. They will have germinated only last autumn, but their vibrant green shoots are stealing a march on their competitors whose seeds are still lying dormant in the soil. And the smell … when I pick and crush a handful of its precocious, sappy shoots, buried last week under a layer of snow, it transports me to the first warm days of April. When spring finally arrives, this weak-stemmed, well-adapted social climber – which invests little in structural strength – will be threading itself through the hedge. It claws its way upwards with row upon row of tiny hooked hairs along the edges of its stems and whorled leaves, gripping anything they touch. Then in May, the minute white, four-petalled flowers will be quickly followed by paired, hooked seeds that are carried away on fur, feathers and clothing. Every generation of children on a country walk learns how tenaciously a well-aimed handful of goosegrass will stick to coats, hats and gloves. The goosegrass is ubiquitous, a ruderal that follows humanity around, thriving wherever we cultivate soil. Which is surely why it has acquired more than 70 local, colloquial names. The commonest is cleavers, but my favourites, bearing witness to its tendency to cling, are gentleman’s tormentors (Suffolk), lover’s kisses (Somerset) and devil’s garters (Northern Ireland). Some of last summer’s withered plants remain woven into this hedge. A few remaining seeds fulfil their destiny and stick to my gloves. That may be how I originally carried it home, where it has since become a persistent, but sometimes useful, garden weed. A handful of those hooked shoots, dragged across the pond surface, magically skims off the floating carpet of duckweed that threatens to smother it every summer without disturbing the aquatic life below."
"Insect populations are suffering “death by a thousand cuts”, with many falling at “frightening” rates that are “tearing apart the tapestry of life”, according to scientists behind a new volume of studies. The insects face multiple, overlapping threats including the destruction of wild habitats for farming, urbanisation, pesticides and light pollution. Population collapses have been recorded in places where human activities dominate, such as in Germany, but there is little data from outside Europe and North America and in particular from wild, tropical regions where most insects live. The scientists are especially concerned that the climate crisis may be causing serious damage in the tropics. But even though much more data is needed, the researchers say enough is already known for urgent action to be taken. Insects are by far the most varied and abundant animals on Earth, with millions of species and outweighing humans by 17 times. They are essential to the ecosystems that humanity depends upon, pollinating plants, providing food for other creatures and recycling nature’s waste. The studies show the situation is complex, with some insect populations increasing, such as those whose range is expanding as global heating curbs cold winter temperatures and others recovering from a low level as pollution in water bodies is reduced. The good news is that the raised profile of insect declines in the past two years has prompted government action in some places, the scientists said, while a “phenomenal’’ number of citizen scientists are helping with the huge challenge of studying these tiny creatures. The 12 new studies are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “Nature is under siege [and] most biologists agree that the world has entered its sixth mass extinction event,” concludes the lead analysis in the package. “Insects are suffering from ‘death by a thousand cuts’ [and] severe insect declines can potentially have global ecological and economic consequences.” Prof David Wagner of the University of Connecticut in the US, the lead author of the analysis, said the abundance of many insect populations was falling by 1-2% a year, a rate that should not be seen as small: “You’re losing 10-20% of your animals over a single decade and that is just absolutely frightening. You’re tearing apart the tapestry of life.” Wagner said most of the causes of insect declines were well known. “But there’s one really big unknown and that’s climate change – that’s the one that really scares me the most.” He said increased climate variability could be “driving [insect] extinctions at a rate that we haven’t seen before”. “Insects are really susceptible to drought because they’re all surface area and no volume,” Wagner said. “Things like dragonflies and damselflies can desiccate to death in an hour with really low humidity.” One of the studies identifies an increasingly erratic climate as the overarching reason for region-wide losses of moths and other insects in the forests of north-western Costa Rica since 1978. This could be a “harbinger of the broader fate of Earth’s tropical forests”, said Wagner. However, another study contradicts a 2018 report of a 98% collapse in insects in a Puerto Rican forest. The new paper says “abundances are not generally declining” and that changes in populations are driven by the impacts of hurricanes and not climate change. Brad Lister, who led the 2018 study, said he was unconvinced by the work but would conduct his own analysis of the data used and submit the conclusion to the PNAS editors. Wagner said increased public attention had spurred some action, such as an EU initiative to protect pollinators, a pledge of €118m (£106m) for insect conservation in Germany and $25m in Sweden. Another of the papers sets out actions that can protect insects. Individuals can rewild their gardens, cut pesticide use and limit outdoor lighting, it said, while countries must reduce the impacts of farming. All groups can help change attitudes towards insects by conveying that they are crucial components of the living world. The biggest systematic assessment of global insect abundances to date, published in April 2020, showed a drop of almost 25% in the last 30 years, with accelerating declines in Europe. It indicated terrestrial insects were declining at close to 1% a year. The previous largest assessment, based on 73 studies, led the researchers to warn of “catastrophic consequences for the survival of mankind” if insect losses were not halted. It estimated the rate of decline at 2.5% a year. Other PNAS papers found both declines and rises. Butterfly numbers have fallen by 50% since 1976 in the UK and by 50% since 1990 in the Netherlands, according to one. It also showed the ranges of butterflies began shrinking long ago, dropping by 80% between 1890 and 1940. However, a study of moths showed zero or only modest long-term decreases over the past two decades in Ecuador and Arizona, US. “The most important thing we learn [from these new studies] is the complexity behind insect declines. No single quick fix is going to solve this problem,” said Roel van Klink of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research. “There are certainly places where insect abundances are dropping strongly, but not everywhere. This is a reason for hope, because it can help us understand what we can do to help them. They can bounce back really fast when the conditions improve.” Wagner said: “We know nature is under siege and we know we are responsible – we don’t really need to have a lot more data to start changing what we do. It’s unconscionable what could happen if we don’t start paying attention and change our way of consumption.”  Another paper in the series, co-authored by Wagner, concluded: “To mitigate the effects of the sixth mass extinction event that we have caused, the following will be necessary: a stable (and almost certainly lower) human population, sustainable levels of consumption, and social justice, that empowers the less wealthy people and nations of the world, where the vast majority of us live.” "
"The environmental activist Greta Thunberg has been featured on a new Swedish postage stamp, in recognition of her work to “preserve Sweden’s unique nature for future generations”. Thunberg, who turned 18 on 3 January, is pictured standing on a rocky cliff top wearing a yellow raincoat, with swifts flying around her, as part of a set by the artist and illustrator Henning Trollbäck titled Valuable Nature. The series, available from Thursday, features some of the 16 environmental quality goals recently drawn up by the Swedish government, including habitats designated as important to protect, said the national postal service, PostNord. Other stamps in the set, intended for domestic letters, feature high mountains and their flora, a forest, an agricultural landscape and a uniquely biodiverse bog. This year’s European stamps include a picture of the endangered green spotted toad. “We’re pleased that Greta, among several illustrations of important nature, will be symbolised on our stamps,” said PostNord’s Kristina Olofsdotter. “These natural places are very important and we all need to do our part to preserve them.” Previous stamp series in Sweden have portrayed Astrid Lindgren, the children’s author who created Pippi Longstocking, the footballer Zlatan Ibrahimović and the late DJ and producer Avicii. In a recent interview to mark her birthday, Thunberg, whose solo school strike in 2018 snowballed into a global youth movement, told the Sunday Times she had stopped flying and “consuming things” but did not judge people whose choices were less environmentally friendly than her own. “I’m not telling anyone else what to do,” she said. “There is a risk when you are vocal about these things and don’t practise as you preach, then you will be criticised and what you are saying won’t be taken seriously.”"
"The Arctic is “pervasively” polluted by microplastic fibres that most likely come from the washing of synthetic clothes by people in Europe and North America, research has found. The most comprehensive study to date found the microplastics in 96 of 97 sea water samples taken from across the polar region. More than 92% of the microplastics were fibres, and 73% of these were made of polyester and were the same width and colours as those used in clothes. Most of the samples were taken from 3-8 metres below the surface, where much marine life feeds. Other recent analysis estimated that 3,500tn plastic microfibres from clothes washing in the US and Canada ended up in the sea each year, while modelling suggested plastic dumped in the seas around the UK was carried to the Arctic within two years. The researchers found plastic fibres at the north pole. With plastic recently discovered at the deepest point on Earth, the Mariana Trench, and the peak of Mount Everest, it is clear humanity’s litter has polluted the entire planet. It is known to injure wildlife that mistake it for food. People also consume microplastics via food and water, and breathe them in, although the health impact is not yet known. Much more water flows into the Arctic from the Atlantic than the Pacific, and the new research found higher concentrations of the microplastic fibres nearer the Atlantic, as well as longer and less degraded fibres. “We’re looking at a dominance of Atlantic inputs, which means sources of textile fibres in the North Atlantic from Europe and North America are likely to be driving the contamination in the Arctic Ocean,” said Peter Ross, at Ocean Wise Conservation Association in Canada, who led the study. “With these polyester fibres, we’ve essentially created a cloud throughout the world’s oceans.” “The Arctic is, yet again, at the receiving end of pollutants from the south,” he said. Toxic chemical pollutants including mercury and PCBs are well known at the pole. “It’s certainly cause for concern, when we realise that the Inuit people rely very heavily on aquatic foods.” The 3-8m layer of sea water is “a biologically important area where we find phytoplankton, zooplankton, small fish, big fish, seabirds and marine mammals, foraging looking for food”, said Ross. Large animals such as turtles, albatross, seals and whales are known to be killed by plastic and he said there was no reason to think it was different for the smaller ones. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications, and took 71 near-surface samples stretching from Norway to the north pole and then into the Canadian High Arctic. Another 26 samples were taken at depths down to 1,000m in the Beaufort Sea, to the north of Alaska. “A dominance of polyester was evident throughout the water column, highlighting the pervasive spread of synthetic fibres throughout the waters of the Arctic Ocean,” the researchers concluded. They found an average of 40 microplastic particles per cubic metre of water. The researchers said the type of plastic found at different depths in the oceans would depend on the density of the plastic, with buoyant polystyrene likely to float and dense PVC more likely to sink to the ocean floor. Polyester is closer to neutral buoyancy. Only a small proportion of the fibres found are thought to be from fishing gear, which use different plastics. It is possible that some of the fibres were carried to the Arctic by winds. “It is impressive how many samples they were able to take from such inhospitable places,” said Erik van Sebille, at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. “The results show again plastic is now omnipresent. The question should perhaps become ‘where don’t we find plastic yet?’” “Plastic anywhere in the environment is an atrocity, but in the Arctic it’s probably more harmful than in most other places,” he said. “That’s because it comes on top of the dramatic and dangerous climate change that the region and its ecosystems are experiencing. Pollution could be the proverbial drop that tips the bucket, as we say in Dutch.” Ross said individuals, clothes manufacturers, wastewater treatment companies and governments could all help stem the flow of microplastics into the Arctic: “We all have a role to play. It’s not about blaming textiles, or blaming the petrochemical complex. It’s about everybody acknowledging that this is not something that we want to see in the world’s oceans.” Van Sebille said: “We could hardly go out and about without clothes, could we? But we should think about better textiles.”"
"In the bleak midwinter, Orkney is surprisingly busy with wildlife. Starlings murmurate over the old Stromness pier every night before flying down to roost in its struts. Geese gather in their hundreds in the hollows between hills. And, down by the water’s edge, seals have been hauling out on to the rocky strands to give birth. A few weeks ago we visited Windwick, South Ronaldsay, to see this year’s crop of pups: the foreshore was crowded with cow seals feeding their fluffy, wet-eyed babies. One or two bulls waited in the shallows nearby, rising and falling with the waves, or seen in silhouette like submarines. One mother sat up to her belly in water, watching her pup yelp for her, seeming to will it forward into the surf. It cried and cried. She waited, eyes fixed on it, then gently rolled over in the foam, as if to demonstrate how fun it might be to swim. It was a charming afternoon. So I have returned to Windwick to check on their progress. At first the beach looked empty. Was I too late? But, craning over the cliff, I finally located a pocket of holdouts. At first I felt a flash of horror: there were bodies strewn over rocks and rotting heaps of kelp. Some sleek and grey marl, others stained a nicotine yellow. All was deathly still, like the aftermath of some terrible battle. But then one flipper paddled the air, another corpse twitched awake, and the whole scene came to life. These are the awkward teenagers of the seal world: in the absence of their mothers they now shed their baby clothes, scratch themselves on rocks, and live off their fat reserves until – eventually – they must leave the beach to begin their seagoing careers. Until then, they will lie around, filling the air with Wookie-like wails. They haul themselves up on to the land, are found on roads and in fields, and generally get under people’s feet. Fifteen per cent of the world’s grey seal population breeds here on Orkney in the winter months. It’s a privilege to see it. But I must admit that some life stages are cuter than others."
"The hill has two names. Its Welsh one as given on the Ordnance Survey map is Allt Tair Ffynnon (high place of three fountains). The other – a local one bestowed since the tide of the old language ebbed from this valley – is both biblical and physically descriptive of rock strata thinly clad by hill vegetation: Jacob’s Ribs. Especially in years of drought, a striking geology is revealed beneath parched grass. You see it to best effect left of the road from Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant to Llanfyllin. There should be stories about it, and perhaps once were, but they’re lost. I’m reminded of Uvayok, a sleeping giant of a hill a quad bike ride out across the tundra from the settlement of Iqaluqtuutiaq in Nunavut – the Inuit High Arctic homeland in Canada. A wealth of tales from the oral tradition attaches to Uvayok. For Allt Tair Ffynnon, to my knowledge there are none. Yet it has such presence. It’s one of those hills that “give back / The sun’s glare with a fixed intensity”, as Hugh MacDiarmid wrote in Bracken Hills in Autumn. Allt Tair Ffynnon is the perfect autumnal bracken hill. It gathers the western light that floods along this valley. A brace of fine journalists for this newspaper group – Christopher Wordsworth and Geoff Nicholson – lie in the chapelyard at its foot. From my skylight, when I lived in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, it dominated the view. I was captivated by this hill, in the way that a rare and lucky man or woman might find in their domestic companion someone whom a world fixated on appearance and achievement might not celebrate, but whose imperturbable good humour is a quiet delight. On winter mornings, it rises above valley mist and frost as a shimmering presence, its bracken a sodden, heavy terracotta against the sky’s wan blue. You come at its dragon-crest summit by way of the hillside beyond Llannerch Aur (golden glade). Three springs – small, gravelly, quartz-pebbled pools among fallen bracken-litter, runnels seeping down from them, rowans overhanging gracefully, fieldfares feasting on frost-darkened berries – punctuate an ascent which few make other than the quiet sheep of the hills. I passed by recently, and stopped to contemplate its glow in the last sun, which stilled my heart."
"A whale skeleton thought to be up to 5,000 years old has been discovered, almost perfectly preserved, by researchers in Thailand. The skeleton, believed to be a Bryde’s whale, was found in Samut Sakhon, west of Bangkok. Researchers have excavated 80% of the remains and have so far identified 19 complete vertebrae, five ribs, a shoulder blade and fins. The skeleton measures 12 metres (39ft), with a skull that is 3 metres long. The bones will be carbon dated to verify their age, but it is thought they are between 3,000 and 5,000 years old. Bryde’s whales are still found in Thailand’s waters, where they are considered a protected species. The whales – which prefer waters above 16C (61F), and feed on schooling fish such as anchovies – face threats from fishing equipment as well as tourism. The remains, which were found about 12km (7.5 miles) inland, will help scientists understand the evolution of the species, and track how sea levels have changed over thousands of years, said Varawut Silpa-archa, the natural resources and environment minister. Marcus Chua, of the National University of Singapore, said the discovery adds to evidence of “relatively large sea level changes around 6,000 years to 3,000 years ago in the Gulf of Thailand, where the shoreline was up to tens of kilometres inland of the present coast”. Previously, only marine deposits containing small fossilised marine shells or crabs had been found inland, and it was not clear if those fossils had been moved by humans, said Chua. “A large subfossil whale dated thousands of years ago near Bangkok would provide strong evidence of where the sea was during that time,” he said. Such evidence is highly relevant, given that the climate crisis is contributing to rising sea levels. “This could certainly bring attention to the issue, and show how and where low-lying areas could be inundated by the sea when that happens,” said Chua. The discovery will also help deepen researchers’ understanding of the Bryde’s whale, as well as other marine life. Alongside the skeleton, researchers found preserved items including shark teeth and shells. “Scientists could also study the deposits found at the same level as the whale to reconstruct the biological communities present during that time, and compare them to present day systems,” said Chua. The exact age of the skeleton is expected to be confirmed in December."
"Scientists have discovered a climate crisis refuge for coral reefs off the coast of Kenya and Tanzania, where species are thriving despite warming events that have killed their neighbours. The coral sanctuary is a wildlife hotspot, teeming with spinner dolphins and boasting rare species, including prehistoric fish and dugongs. Researchers believe its location in a cool spot in the ocean is helping to protect it and the surrounding marine life from the harmful effects of the climate crisis. Tim McClanahan, the author of a study on the refuge published this month in Advances in Marine Biology, has been looking for coral sanctuaries in the west Indian Ocean for more than a decade. “I’m very excited about it,” McClanahan said. “It gives us something to hope for. Some good news in gloomy times.” Marine biologists are scouring the ocean to find and protect coral refuges – areas where reefs have the best chance to survive the climate crisis. McClanahan, the lead scientist for the Wildlife Conservation Society, who lives and works in Mombasa, Kenya, said he had an “epiphany” when he realised why the reef was so rich in wildlife. The coastline has the highest density of dolphins in east Africa, and coelacanths, fish once believed extinct, swim in its deep waters. “I thought ‘why are all the animals here?’ And I realised it was because of Kilimanjaro,” he said. The coral refuge, which stretches from Shimoni, 50 miles south of Mombasa, in Kenya to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, is fed by cool water from deep channels formed thousands of years ago by glacial runoff from Kilimanjaro and the Usambara mountains. The cool water appears to protect the corals from episodic warming events like El Niño.  McClanahan put temperature gauges along the coast and used satellite data to monitor them. Then, when there was a warming event, which occur only every few years, he got into the water to see its effects for himself. “It turns out there is a long stretch from Kenyan waters into Dar Es Salaam where these warm water events like El Niño don’t penetrate. So the stress killing corals does not penetrate. Outside that area, the corals are bleached and dying. But inside the area, of around 400 sq km [150 sq miles] they retain their colour and their health. They are reds and brown. My research partner likes to call them: ‘happy corals’.” McClanahan said he has found three potential coral sanctuaries in the western Indian Ocean, but only for this one is the available scientific evidence “pretty strong”. Part of his research was to examine whether – if fisheries are better managed – the effects of global heating could be mitigated in the ocean. “Our study shows that while warming waters may devastate surrounding reefs, this area could become an incredibly important sanctuary where marine species big and small will flock to find refuge from climate change,” he said. “If well protected, this key transboundary marine ecosystem will remain a jewel of biodiversity for the entire east African coast.” Unfortunately, however, the climate crisis is not the only threat to the area’s biodiversity and the newly discovered refuge. Unsustainable fishing continues, and there are future plans for coastal development, including a port in northern Tanzania."
"An “ecological Swat team” has discovered 20 previously unknown species in the misty cloud forests and cascading waterfalls that flank Bolivia’s Zongo valley. Among the animals found were a minuscule 10mm-long frog, a pit viper, two metalmark butterflies and an adder’s-mouth orchid. The pristine forests are just 30 miles (48km) from the capital, La Paz, but the expedition also rediscovered the devil-eyed frog, seen just once before, and a satyr butterfly not seen for nearly a century. Alongside these were threatened species including the spectacled bear and the channel-billed toucan. The high, steep-sided peaks of the Andes harbour enormous biodiversity because movement between them is difficult for wildlife and results in isolated hotspots of evolution that are known as “sky islands”. The scientists spent two weeks hiking up and down the 2,000-metre slopes and, while expecting to find some new insects, were surprised by what they encountered. “We certainly did not expect to find new vertebrates, like the two snakes and the frog, so that was very exciting,” said Trond Larsen, of Conservation International, who co-led the expedition with Claudia Cortez, the head of conservation for the municipal government of La Paz. “What’s so amazing is that you could hear the distinctive call of the little frog throughout the forest, but you get close and they stop calling,” Trond said. “Trying to spot it when it’s not making a sound and is hidden in the moss was a tremendous task.” The team rediscovered the devil-eyed frog that had only been seen once, 20 years previously, by Steffen Reichle, a Bolivia-based scientist who was also on the new expedition. “That was really exciting – it was just assumed it must have gone extinct, but we actually found it to be relatively common,” Larsen said. The expedition was part of Conservation International’s Rapid Assessment Program, which Trond describes as an “ecological Swat team” that responds when information on a poorly known area is urgently needed. In the Zongo valley, the assessment is underpinning a new conservation area that will protect not only wildlife but also the clean water, construction materials and forest foods that local people rely on. The ecosystem also regulates the flow of water to the small dams in the valley that help power Bolivia’s capital. The protected mountain slopes will furthermore provide vital refuges for species moving uphill to escape the rising heat brought by the climate crisis. The 17-strong team of scientists hiked into their study area over a long, high suspension bridge that spans the Zongo River. As well as the highly venomous pit viper, they found another new snake which had the red, yellow and green colours of the Bolivian flag. The flowers of the new adder’s-mouth orchid appear to mimic an insect and may serve to fool unwitting pollinators, while a new cup orchid displayed striking purple and yellow flowers. A bamboo species found by the team was new to science but already well known by indigenous communities who use it to make musical instruments called sikus, or panpipes. Another plant, in the arrowroot family and which closes its leaves at night, similar to hands in prayer, was rediscovered after 125 years. “This truly beautiful and diverse landscape has become a safe haven for amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and plants that haven’t been found anywhere else on earth,” said Larsen."
"The water shines blue and gold in the evening light. Across the fields, a herd of dark fallow deer runs out of the trees and across the brooks. One by one, they slow to a stop and queue, waiting as the animal in front of them disappears into a ditch, reappears as it climbs out, and then runs to catch up with the others. I count 79 deer, but see only one adult stag, its tall antlers glinting as it turns to watch the stragglers. A female marsh harrier, brown with a cream head, flaps over them, probably heading to roost. The sun will soon drop below the shadows of the South Downs, so I turn and head down the steep flood bank and back across the marsh. Noisy flocks of starlings descend on the tall trees by the river. They crowd on to the branches and chatter in a loud atonal chorus. More join them and the cacophony builds. Then they begin to soar into the air, 40 or more at a time, forming clouds of black dots – swerving in fluid, changing shapes, first one way, then back, moving across the brooks until they rise above a patch of reedbed and drop down into it. As the birds adjust their flickering wings to land, the sunlight leaks through their turning feathers, making the wings shimmer briefly, like flashing lights, before they disappear. I watch several small groups perform the same ritual as they settle down for the night. Only occasional bursts of chattering from deep within the vegetation – growing louder, then fading – give away their presence. A bird of prey spears low across the dark water and up over the reeds. The starlings react instantly, exploding in deafening alarm calls. Some fly up in defensive swarms, while the others scatter across the marsh or stay hidden. The sparrowhawk, a large female, chases across the reedbed, then turns and dives out of sight. It must be the same bird that hunts here most evenings, having learned to make the most of the wintering roosts. She emerges again, this time flapping slowly, purposefully, carrying a limp starling in one dangling foot. She glides into the blackness between the nearby trees."
"Labor says revelations that the former environment minister Josh Frydenberg proposed amending the boundaries to an area of internationally significant wetlands after he was lobbied by a developer and major party donor demonstrate why Australia needs an independent environmental regulator. Federal Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, compared the now-treasurer’s past proposal in relation to Toondah Harbour to the Jam Land case, in which Frydenberg’s office sought advice about changing protections to grasslands at the centre of an investigation into illegal clearing on a property part-owned by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and his relatives. “Another day, another historic example of Josh Frydenberg trying to change the rules to help his mates,” Butler said. Guardian Australia revealed on Thursday that Frydenberg wrote to the Queensland government in early August 2017 concerning Walker Corporation’s proposed Toondah Harbour apartment and retail complex. He suggested the two governments jointly create a proposal to change the boundary of the Moreton Bay Ramsar wetland. Walker Corporation, which has been a major Liberal party donor, has applied to build up to 3,600 apartments, a marina, a hotel and shops inside Moreton Bay, south-east of Brisbane. The site is an important habitat for migratory birds and is listed under the Ramsar convention, an international treaty set up to protect the ecological character of listed wetlands. In the letter to Queensland’s then environment minister – now the deputy premier – Steven Miles, Frydenberg wrote that in order to meet Australia’s obligations under the Ramsar convention any proposal to change the boundary of the wetland “is required to demonstrate that the change is in the ‘urgent national interest’ and that additional areas of compensatory habitat be included in a revised boundary”. Lang Walker and executives from Walker Corporation had met with Frydenberg and senior environmental officials in 2016 and department records of that meeting show they raised the potential under the Ramsar convention for part of the wetland to be delisted in the “urgent national interest”. “The proponent had previously lobbied Mr Frydenberg about the project,” Butler said. “Mr Frydenberg’s 2017 letter indicated that amending the boundaries for the internationally protected wetlands would need to be done by demonstrating ‘urgent national interest’.” A spokeswoman for Frydenberg said: “No environmental approval was provided for the project while the former minister was in the portfolio.” Butler said: “Mr Frydenberg has history as environment minister. Today’s revelations reinforce the need for strong national environmental standards and a strong independent cop on the beat,” she said. Guardian Australia revealed in 2019 that Taylor met with Frydenberg’s office and senior environmental officials to discuss critically endangered and protected grasslands that were at the centre of an investigation into illegal clearing by Jam Land, a company in which he holds shares via his family company Gufee. The Guardian’s investigation found evidence to suggest that Frydenberg’s office canvassed whether protections for the grasslands could be watered down and whether this could be done without making the decision public. Both Frydenberg and Taylor have repeatedly stated that their discussions at the time were focused only on the “technical aspects” of the grasslands listing, with Taylor saying he had raised the matter on behalf of constituents in his electorate of Hume and that he “has never asked Mr Frydenberg to change laws governing the clearing of native grasslands”. Frydenberg said at the time: “Following the briefing and since, no changes to the listing have been made.” But the Greens democracy spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, said on Thursday: “We have never had a satisfactory answer about the role Frydenberg played in seeking to downgrade the listing of endangered vegetation on property owned by Angus Taylor’s family.” She added that Frydenberg’s letter about the Toondah Harbour development was “yet more proof” of the need for “strong protections for nature that are independently enforced”. “These FOI documents raise serious questions about the extent to which this government will consider relaxing environmental protections to push through developments proposed by their donor mates,” Waters said."
"An empty 1970s shopping centre in Nottingham could be transformed into wetlands, pocket woodlands and a wildflower meadow as part of a post-pandemic urban rewilding project. The debate about Broadmarsh shopping centre, considered an eyesore by many, has rumbled on for years. This year it was undergoing a £86m revamp by real estate investment trust Intu when the firm went into administration. The number of empty shops on UK high streets has risen to its highest level in six years, and as retail giants such as Debenhams and Arcadia Group falter, Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust has come up with a new model of inner city regeneration: urban rewilding. The trust wants to bulldoze the already half-demolished Broadmarsh building and turn it into 2.5 hectares (6 acres) of scruffy green space at an estimated cost of £3-4m. The designs were created with Influence Landscape Architects and could set a precedent for what to do with the growing amount of vacant retail space in other cities. “It’s unbelievable to hear that stores like Debenhams are in the position they are in – they’re stalwarts of the city, but it does put out an opportunity,” said Sara Boland, managing director of Influence. Ponds surrounded by reeds, crocus meadows and wet grasslands would attract butterflies, dragonflies and a range of birds including reed warblers and black redstarts, according to the Wildlife Trust, which is calling on people to back its green vision. It will put its plans to Nottingham city council in the coming weeks as the authority canvasses views on what Broadmarsh could become as part of a 10-week consultation process. The proposed scheme would run counter to the conventional idea of urban parks and instead hark back to what Broadmarsh would have looked like in centuries gone by. “Often open spaces in cities can be manicured and a bit formal,” said Boland. “The idea of this was to have more rewilding, restoring, protecting – this kind of connectivity, so the zones we then developed were about foraging, pond dipping and protecting species.” Nineteenth-century maps helped architects get a clear picture of what this part of Nottinghamshire once looked like – a fertile garden area covered in fruit trees. Old street names include Pear Street and Peach Street; those fruits would be grown in the park to reflect its heritage. Crisscrossing the park would be walkways based on centuries-old street layouts. Nottingham Wildlife Trust has long wanted to create green corridors in this area of the city to connect it to Sherwood Forest to the north. It has put up nest boxes on many buildings close to Broadmarsh to encourage black redstarts, which used to live in the city but are now rarely seen. “We’ve actually spent quite a bit of time over the past 20 or 30 years looking at various redevelopment proposals for this part of the city and for the Broadmarsh centre. We’ve submitted ideas for roof gardens and new avenues, all sorts of greener features,” said Erin McDaid, head of communications and marketing at Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust. “We feel this could be a real opportunity for the city to stand out from the crowd as cities across the UK look to recover their economies and find a new direction for urban centres.”  The Broadmarsh centre was opened in 1975, in an area of the city designed with drivers in mind. Now times are changing, said Nottingham resident Ewan Cameron. “I don’t think people really want [a shopping centre]. It’s kind of a 90s style of thinking … Broadmarsh felt like a place that people used to walk through, but there was no sense of community, no sense of life. “Anyone coming into Nottingham on the train would have to pass by it before they reached the city centre, and it was just this horrible, ugly building with no windows. It was very unwelcoming,” he said. When Intu went into administration five months ago, Cameron started a petition to turn the unloved shopping centre into green space. It struck a chord with many people, and already has 10,000 signatures. Last year Nottingham city council won the Guardian’s public service award for its ambitious policies to become the UK’s first carbon-neutral city. The city met its 2020 target to reduce carbon emissions by 26% four years early and the energy consumption of council buildings has fallen by 39%. A green development would show the city’s commitment to securing 30% of land for nature by 2030, the Wildlife Trust says. David Mellen, Nottingham city council leader, said the conversation about the Broadmarsh site had captured people’s imagination. He said: “It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine a significant space right in the heart of one of the country’s core cities and build a new vision for urban areas following the coronavirus pandemic that is people centred and green but also leads to jobs and housing, improving quality of life.” Cameron said he was “blown away” by the new designs. “It’s a chance for people to rethink how cities work and how we can design cities to make people’s lives better, rather than a place to shop,” he said. “I hope the council will genuinely listen to people and I hope they haven’t made their mind up already and this isn’t a box-ticking exercise.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"Walls, windows and a mid-morning cuppa break were no defence against a rising rush of sound that demanded investigation. The hiss and swish, like a battering hailstorm but on a blue-sky day, arose from somewhere out of doors. It flushed us out into the back garden – a mistake. A dozen or so jackdaws zipped over, and they were heading for the main action, towards a swell that came from over the other side of the rooftop. We raced back through the house and opened the front door to a sky darkened with crows. I hazarded a hundred, but it could have been twice that number. The jackdaws flocked by disciplined instinct and swilled around half a dozen lime trees, quilting the air with vapourless trails. A few carrion crows mingled among them, but they abided by no rules, often beating across the jackdaw traffic. I saw one lumpen hulk of a crow collide with its smaller cousin, sending it into an open-winged cartwheel. The magpies stayed true to their ancestry as forest birds and jumped, as if nervously, from branch to branch. The sight was as nothing compared with the mob music that brayed out of this soup of corvids. The daws lengthened their “jack” calls, lacing them with excitement or anxiety; some even gave orgiastic yelps. One of the magpies sank its familiar high ack-ack rattle into a low slow drill, a purr with menace. The crows – well, I couldn’t hear them above the din. What was all this commotion about? Round and round the limes circled the crows, an audience looking for an event. A man passing with two perplexed-looking sons in tow offered a witness statement: “The magpies have got something dead on the roof.” But we could see nothing at all on any roof. The accused in black and white had ganged up by now, seven for a secret never to be told perching on the rungs of one lime, while two for joy occupied its neighbour. They fell silent, and waited. Nothing to see, move on. The clamour overhead had dropped to a hush, the birds melted away. The tension had gone out of the scene, the heat had gone out of my teacup."
"Communities in the UK are being asked to bid to host a prototype nuclear fusion power plant, which a government-backed programme plans to build by 2040. The site does not need to be near existing nuclear power stations but will need 100 hectares of land and a plentiful water supply. Ministers say the project would bring thousands of skilled jobs and be part of its planned “green industrial revolution” to tackle the climate crisis. Nuclear fusion replicates the intense atomic reactions that power the sun and uses a hydrogen isotope found in seawater as fuel. It cannot produce a runaway chain reaction like conventional nuclear fission, which involves splitting atoms rather than fusing them together. The level of radioactive waste is also far lower. No exclusion zone will be needed around the site, officials said. However, the technical challenges are enormous and the programme’s leaders acknowledge it is “hugely ambitious”. This is because fuel heated to 10 times the temperature of the sun has to be magnetically levitated to stop it melting the reactor vessel. Scientists and engineers have pursued the dream of limitless and clean fusion energy for more than half a century, but the first power stations remain decades away. The UK programme is called Step – the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production – and has been granted £222m to date by the government. Communities have until March 2021 to submit their nominations, with the successful site chosen by the end of 2022. “We want the UK to be a trailblazer in developing fusion energy,” said Alok Sharma, the business and energy secretary. He said communities had an “incredible opportunity to secure their place in the history books” by potentially helping the UK to be the first country in the world to commercialise fusion power. The UK has the largest working fusion reactor in the world – called Jet – at the Culham Science Centre near Oxford. However, a far larger €20bn (£18bn) fusion reactor called Iter is being assembled in France, backed by the world’s biggest countries. It expects to create its first super-heated plasma by 2025 and reach full power by 2035, with the aim of demonstrating that more energy can be taken out than is put in. The goal of Step is to show that a smaller and less expensive plant can create fusion power. Key to this is the spherical shape of the chamber that contains the plasma, which is more compact than the doughnut-shaped chamber being used at Iter. However, this compactness means the Step system must have a much more efficient cooling system. Technology to achieve this is being tested in the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (Mast) experiment, also at Culham. But the Culham site is too small to host the Step project. Prof Ian Chapman, the chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, which is leading Step, said: “Step is about moving from research and development to delivery. It will prove that fusion is not a far-off dream, but a dawning reality.” Tim Luce, the chief scientist at Iter, said: “It is gratifying to see the UK make a firm commitment to continuing its historic leadership in magnetic fusion development. Step promises lower costs but faces various engineering and physics challenges, such as large stresses in the magnet structure and high heat fluxes to the wall. [But] first plasma in 2040 appears to be a realistic goal, assuming favourable and timely results in the present generation of spherical tokamaks.” The UK is a participant in Iter due to its membership of Euratom, but it will leave the group after Brexit. However, officials say they are hopeful that the UK can rejoin Iter as an associate country. The timetable for Step is to have a concept design by 2024, then a detailed engineering design allowing the start of construction in 2032 and operations to begin in 2040."
"For 20 years, Richard Lechleitner had a grueling task at Mt Rainier national park: digging human waste out of backcountry toilets and carrying it down the mountains. Staff at the park in Washington state grappled with an influx of visitors hiking far from roads, along with thousands of climbers attempting to reach the active volcano’s 14,000ft summit each year. People heeded the call of nature on Mt Rainier’s pristine glaciers, as well as in its unvarnished wilderness toilets. “They’d put in these horrible toilets that just smelled terrible,” Lechleitner said. Maintaining them, he found, was appallingly dirty work.  At national parks across the US, from the peaks of Denali in Alaska to desert backpacking destinations in Utah and Arizona, managers have struggled to deal with this inevitable byproduct of people eager to get outdoors, a desire that continues amid the pandemic. Unlike a discarded Clif Bar wrapper, human waste carries a slew of bacteria and pathogens when left unbagged or otherwise unaddressed. Colorado’s Rocky Mountain national park has been hit especially hard. There, a surge in visitors meant toilet paper became a more common sight in wilderness areas, rangers told the Guardian. But the park is now known nationally for pioneering a solution used at other sites, including Mt Rainier. Between 2016 and 2019, the 265,000-acre park near Denver saw a 40% increase in visitors hiking and climbing its woods and jagged peaks. In 2019, it was the third-most visited national park in the US. More hikers than ever were flocking to Longs Peak, a sheer 14,000ft mountain near the continental divide. The main trail attracts thousands of people each day during the summer, but around the mountain there are just four toilets, spread miles apart. That leaves hikers with limited options.  By 2015, rangers were trekking to the toilets and finding repulsive conditions. At its worst, the solid matter would freeze and thaw repeatedly and rise above the seat. Rangers would have to dig the material from the chamber and load it into a five-gallon bucket, place the cargo on to a pack animal and ride down. “This is some of the worst work in the world,” said Geoff Hill, a toilet entrepreneur who worked with the park’s rangers as a doctoral student studying backcountry waste. Because the toilets were in such a sordid state, many hikers probably refused to use them, opting instead to dig a shallow hole or cover their business with a rock. Human pathogens can sully streams and harm high-altitude denizens, such as marmots. The beaver-like creatures would sometimes become stuck inside the toilet chambers and covered in waste, according to park staff. Park chiefs poured time and resources into a solution. They settled on a nifty toilet product that Hill designed, called ToiletTech. The system separates urine from solid waste, which creates cleaner excrement – and less work for rangers. Beneath the toilet seat, excrement lands on a small conveyor belt, while urine flows through a separate pipe and into a septic field. When a visitor presses a foot-powered pump inside the bathroom, ordure travels from the conveyor belt into its own chamber. There, it remains dry, lightweight and free of viruses usually present in a wet barrel of urine-soaked waste. The new facilities, which replaced the four toilets near Longs Peak, have since helped cut down on solid matter in the area and made rangers’ lives much easier, although 200mph winds once blew the doors off a unit in the Boulder Field area. Land managers have installed Hill’s toilets across the country to rave reviews, from Angel’s Landing in Utah’s Zion national park to Terwilliger Hot Springs outside Portland, Oregon, as well as at Mt Rainier. “If I was to win the lottery, I literally would go out … and buy enough toilets to work in all of the backcountry camps at Mt Rainier,” Lechleitner said of the new design. But even Hill’s toilets come with drawbacks. Waste from remote areas is still flown out by helicopter, which is expensive. Lechleitner also said the ToiletTech units aren’t cheap, at $4,000 per unit, and National Park System maintenance upgrades are notoriously backlogged. Mt Rainier is a petri dish for experiments in another, cheaper method of waste control: requiring climbers to carry their own excreta off the mountain when they’re not near bathrooms. Land managers will either supply visitors with a kind of plastic bag – often containing an inner lining that seals and neutralizes some of the smell – or ask that they bring their own. Merely asking hikers to carry their waste has helped protect Coyote Gulch, a maze of narrow canyons swarmed with backpackers in Utah’s Glen Canyon national recreation area, and other popular canyons. The dry environment means waste won’t degrade easily there, and the remote region only has one toilet, said the ranger Steve Henry. “People are really opening up to the idea,” Henry said. Plastic bags aren’t a perfect fix – they have to be incinerated at a cost to already cash-strapped agencies, or tossed in a landfill. And people generally don’t want to carry their own feces for days on end. If a bathroom is still miles away and hikers don’t have a carry-out bag, the best thing they can is tote a trowel to a spot far from streams and trails, said Ben Lawhorn, director of education and research for the outdoor ethics group Leave No Trace.  “Once you get eight miles into the backcountry, it’s up to you to dig a hole,” Lawhorn said."
"Cultured meat, produced in bioreactors without the slaughter of an animal, has been approved for sale by a regulatory authority for the first time. The development has been hailed as a landmark moment across the meat industry. The “chicken bites”, produced by the US company Eat Just, have passed a safety review by the Singapore Food Agency and the approval could open the door to a future when all meat is produced without the killing of livestock, the company said. Dozens of firms are developing cultivated chicken, beef and pork, with a view to slashing the impact of industrial livestock production on the climate and nature crises, as well as providing cleaner, drug-free and cruelty-free meat. Currently, about 130 million chickens are slaughtered every day for meat, and 4 million pigs. By weight, 60% of the mammals on earth are livestock, 36% are humans and only 4% are wild. The cells for Eat Just’s product are grown in a 1,200-litre bioreactor and then combined with plant-based ingredients. Initial availability would be limited, the company said, and the bites would be sold in a restaurant in Singapore. The product would be significantly more expensive than conventional chicken until production was scaled up, but Eat Just said it would ultimately be cheaper. The cells used to start the process came from a cell bank and did not require the slaughter of a chicken because cells can be taken from biopsies of live animals. The nutrients supplied to the growing cells were all from plants. The growth medium for the Singapore production line includes foetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood, but this is largely removed before consumption. A plant-based serum would be used in the next production line, the company said, but was not available when the Singapore approval process began two years ago. A series of scientific studies have shown that people in rich nations eat more meat than is healthy for them or the planet. Research shows cutting meat consumption is vital in tackling the climate crisis and some scientists say this is the best single environmental action a person can take. The companies developing lab-grown meat believe this is the product most likely to wean committed meat-eaters off traditional sources. Vegan diets are viewed as unappealing by some, and plant-based meat replacements are not always regarded as replicating the texture and flavour of conventional meat. Meat cultivated in bioreactors also avoids the issues of bacterial contamination from animal waste and the overuse of antibiotics and hormones in animals. The small scale of current cultured meat production requires a relatively high use of energy and therefore carbon emissions. But once scaled up its manufacturers say it will produce much lower emissions and use far less water and land than conventional meat. Josh Tetrick, of Eat Just, said: “I think the approval is one of the most significant milestones in the food industry in the last handful of decades. It’s an open door and it’s up to us and other companies to take that opportunity. My hope is this leads to a world in the next handful of years where the majority of meat doesn’t require killing a single animal or tearing down a single tree.” But he said major challenges remained, with the reaction of consumers to cultured meat perhaps being the most significant: “Is it different? For sure. Our hope is through transparent communication with consumers, what this is and how it compares to conventional meat, we’re able to win. But it’s not a guarantee.” He said the cultured chicken was nutritionally the same as conventional meat. Other challenges included getting regulatory approval in other nations and increasing production. “If we want to serve the entire country of Singapore, and eventually bring it to elsewhere in the world, we need to move to 10,000-litre or 50,000-litre-plus bioreactors,” Tetrick said. Eat Just already has experience in selling non-animal products, such as its plant-based egg and vegan mayonnaise, to consumers. Another company, Supermeat.com in Israel, has just begun free public tastings involving a “crispy cultured chicken”. Industry experts said other companies, including Memphis Meats, Mosa Meat and Aleph Farms, might do well in future as they were working on textured products such as steaks and were able to produce significant amounts of lab-grown meat from the start. Tyson and Cargill, two of the world’s biggest conventional meat companies, now have a stake in Memphis Meats. A recent report form the global consultancy AT Kearney predicted that most meat in 2040 would not come from dead animals. The firm’s Carsten Gerhardt said: “Approval in an innovation hotspot like Singapore already in 2020 could fast-forward market entry in other developed nations. In the long run we are convinced that cultured meat will address the health and environmental impact issues that traditional meat has when produced in a highly industrialised way.” Gerhardt said he expected cultured meat would replace cuts of traditional meat, but that plant-based products, which were less expensive, were more likely to replace burgers and sausages. “The [Eat Just approval] is a very big deal for the future of meat production globally,” said Bruce Friedrich, at the non-profit Good Food Institute in the US. “A new space race for the future of food is under way.” He said cultivated meat was unlikely to become mainstream for some years, until it matched the cost of conventional meat. Hsin Huang, the secretary general of the International Meat Secretariat, which represents the global meat and livestock industry, agreed the cultured meat approval was a significant moment. “It seems certain that similar products from other companies will follow,” he said. “There has been so much hype on cell-cultured meat that the anticipated first steps to mass sales is a significant moment.” “We believe the market potential for cultured meat is vast, as consumers in general continue to show great enthusiasm for the taste and nutritional benefits of animal products. Of course, our view is that real animal products will better meet these needs, but healthy competition is welcome.” He added that livestock are currently essential to the livelihoods of an estimated one billion poor people globally. He said the IMS believed strongly in consumer choice, with appropriate labelling and regulation."
"Brazilian activists have voiced alarm over their government’s plans to bulldoze a 94-mile highway through a biodiverse corner of the Amazon along the border with Peru that is home to at least three indigenous communities. The planned road is an extension of the BR-364, a 2,700-mile highway that links São Paulo with the Amazon state of Acre, and would connect the town of Cruzeiro do Sul with the Peruvian border town of Pucallpa. Backers of the “transoceanic” project, who include Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, argue it will boost the economy of this remote region by creating a transport hub through which agricultural products can be shipped to Pacific ports in Peru and on to China. “This project won’t destroy the forest, it will bring sustainable development to the region by heating up commercial and cultural relations [with Peru],” said Mara Rocha, a centre-right congresswoman from Acre who supports the idea. Rocha said the project was critical to a region that felt “forgotten and invisible to the rest of the country”. Opponents, however, fear it could have catastrophic consequences for Brazil’s environment, which is already reeling under Bolsonaro as the rate of Amazon deforestation soars to its highest level in more than a decade. A report in the Estado de São Paulo newspaper said an 80-mile (130km) stretch of pristine forest would need to be felled to build the road, which would cut through the centre of the protected Serra do Divisor national park. Experts call the park one of the Amazon’s most biodiverse regions, hosting at least 130 species of mammal and more than 400 species of bird. Brazilian lawmakers are considering plans to water down its protections in an apparent attempt to accelerate the road’s construction. Luís Puwe Puyanawa, a local indigenous leader who opposes the project, said: “The truth is that nobody in Acre needs this transoceanic route – there’s already a road linking us to Peru. What we need is to leave the forest standing.” Miguel Scarcello, the head of SOS Amazônia, an environmental group based in the state capital, Rio Branco, described the project as “irresponsible” and a throwback to Brazil’s military dictatorship when roads where bulldozed through the Amazon in an attempt to populate and develop the region. “It’s such an old-fashioned, backwards vision … that pays absolutely no attention to conservation. It will cut through an untouched area of forest and affect the headwaters of really important tributaries of the Juruá River,” Scarcello said. He described how during the 1964-85 dictatorship such roads “decimated” indigenous communities and inflicted “immense destruction” on the rainforest, as loggers used them to access previously inaccessible areas. “We’re not in the 1960s any more,” Scarcello said. “It’s as if we’ve learned nothing from the effects that this could cause and how much destruction could be caused.” He added: “They say it will bring development but, as always, it will be development for half a dozen people,” and he warned of a “carnival of land grabbing” that would accompany the planned road. If the project is approved, three indigenous communities near the road will reportedly be affected: Nukini, Jaminawa and Poyanawa. Scarcello said it was possible the national park was also home to isolated tribes with whom contact had not been made. Puyanawa, 41, said he feared his community would be worst hit. “The road is expected to pass within about a kilometre of our lands. One of my biggest concerns is that this stretch is home to some of the most important water sources of the Amazon basin. The Alto Juruá provides all the waters that flow into the Rio Solimões and then Rio Negro, until they reach the sea,” he said. “All of these rivers could be really affected and this could cause the disappearance of important headwaters in the Amazon. With that, many species could disappear.” Puyanawa said plans for such a route had been touted by politicians for decades but appeared to have accelerated since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. “Nobody has wanted it as much as Bolsonaro,” he said. Bolsonaro has overseen a highly controversial dismantling of Brazil’s environmental protection system, causing Amazon deforestation to skyrocket, critics say. Last month government figures showed Amazon destruction had surged to a 12-year high, with an area seven times larger than Greater London lost between August 2019 and July 2020. That increase has been blamed on the feeling of impunity that Bolsonaro’s presidency has brought illegal loggers, cattle ranchers and miners seeking to cash in. “They feel completely at ease,” said Carlos Rittl, a Brazilian environmentalist who works at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Germany. “We are being governed by people whose motto for the environment is: destruction.” The BR-364 extension, which Bolsonaro has publicly backed as a means to give Brazil “a passage to the Pacific”, is not the only Amazon road project worrying environmentalists and climate campaigners. Last week his administration said it would begin repaving the BR-319, a decaying dictatorship-era highway that cuts north to south through the Amazon from Manaus to Porto Velho. “A historic day for the north!” Bolsonaro wrote on Facebook, announcing the news. But in a recent essay, Prof Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at Brazil’s National Institute for Amazonian Research, said reviving the BR-319, which has been abandoned since late 1980s, “would give deforesters access to about half of what remains of the country’s Amazon forest” and was “certainly among the most consequential decisions facing Brazil today”."
"When it was born, the second world war was several years away, none of the Beatles were alive and there were about five billion fewer people above the waves than today. An unnamed 81-year-old midnight snapper, caught by the Australian Institute of Marine Science in 2016, has been revealed as the oldest tropical reef fish known to science. The discovery was made as part of a new study to find out how changing ocean temperatures might affect the biology of these fish, and others like them. Not far behind the octogenarian snapper among the new discoveries was a 79-year-old red bass caught during a fisheries survey in 1997. Both were caught at Rowley Shoals off north-west Australia. Dr Brett Taylor, a fish biologist at the institute who led the study, said he “may have used some colourful language” when he realised the snapper specimen was 20 years older than the previous record for a tropical reef fish – a rockfish from the Caribbean. “The first thing I did was email my co-authors from Western Australia fisheries ... ‘am I seeing this right?” Taylor and colleagues aged the fish by examining “one of nature’s gifts to scientists” – small ear bones called otoliths that never stop growing and have visible bands like the rings of a tree. The study examined the ages of three species – red bass (Lutjanus bohar), midnight snapper (Macolor macularis) and black and white snapper (Macolor niger) – none of which are widely caught commercially. But their close relatives are. “Snappers make up a large component of commercial fisheries in tropical Australia and they’re also a key target for recreational fishers,” said Dr Stephen Newman, from the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development. He said long-lived fish were considered more vulnerable to fishing pressure. As well as the two oldest fish, the research found nine other specimens that were more than 60 years old. Taylor told the Guardian: “A lot of these snapper species that are commercially harvested are 40, 50 and 60 years old that people are buying. There’s a serious history to some of these.” He said he had separately analysed the ocean temperatures in the tropical Indian Ocean where the oldest snapper and red bass were caught. “We talk about climate change being something in the future, but these 80-year-old fish saw a tremendous uptake of temperature [in the ocean] in their life spans.” Taylor said the research underscored that as oceans warm, the lifespan and growth rate of fish would change – important information for economies and communities that rely on fishing. He said: “The main point is to understand how temperature affects growth and the lifespans of these species. By 2100, I don’t think we will have any more 80-year-old midnight snappers. “These locations will warm to a point that based on current models it will have an impact on their biology.” The long-lived tropical fish analysed by Taylor and colleagues are a long way from being the oldest fish in the ocean. That record belongs to the Greenland shark. Analysis of the eyes of these Arctic dwellers has revealed a lifespan as great as 400 years."
"This is a disappearing watery world – always on the verge of surrender to the churning belt of brine beyond the shingle bank. The path in midwinter is flooded and, standing with my sketchbook, feet like the reeds’ in the clear dark water, I think of Elizabeth Bishop’s poem Sandpiper: “… that every so often the world is bound to shake”. This fragile place shakes and shimmers continuously. Nothing is still. France Woods, to my west, is opalescent in the late afternoon, its many oaks a flat plane of optical greys as the weak sun sinks behind the hill. The water between us dances with tiny halations – lead-white and gold. Ash, sycamore and alder branches sweep and tangle in the foreground, bone-black and intricate against the light. Goat willows, toughly delicate, dark green and grey, fan into the listening heavens, offering up just a few slim ovals of bronze – tiny brushstrokes of colour in the December sky. From the top of a young sycamore (her smooth bark a pale, raw umber, buds perfect in their as yet unwrecked opposing symmetry), a robin effortlessly sings the spaces between things. What am I doing? My left boot has started to let in the icy water and my hands, even gloved, are numb. I’ve been drawing for an hour and have only a page of scribbles to show for it – pathetic grasping attempts to describe and outline. Tethered to form in a formless world. From somewhere in the reeds there is the muffled trumpet of a coot, and a cormorant slides rapidly out of his reflection to swallow a struggling eel in the open water. Mesmerised, I can clearly see the writhing lump fight and bulge in the bird’s long throat. Low in the water, he raises his hooked bill, repeatedly stretches, and dips. Sipping water, easing the meal down. Later, from his oak perch, he preens and ignores me (he has seen me before), a strange and wingless biped who understands nothing. The evening lays out her dark pieces, and I abandon my drawing to watch him: Miltonian creature, wingèd eel, part of this place, part of this paradise, this world of loss; alive until he isn’t."
"People are being invited to help track the spread of a moth that often hides its hindwings of dazzling fuchsia beneath a dowdy brown “overcoat”. The dark crimson underwing has enjoyed an “amazing” August, according to experts, appearing in many new locations, including the first ever recorded sighting in Wales. Its spread, along with that of other large “underwing” moths boasting bright colours beneath grey-brown forewings, will be recorded by thousands of enthusiasts during Moth Night, an annual three-night event on 27-29 August during which people are urged to go moth-spotting. While many moth populations are in decline, climate change is dramatically boosting the abundance and distribution of several species of underwing. The red underwing is one of Britain’s largest moths, with a wingspan of up to 9cm (3.5in). Until recent decades it was restricted to southern and central England, but is now spreading northwards and westwards and has been recorded in Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. The rarer dark crimson and light crimson underwings were once confined to the New Forest but are now flying over new sites in southern England. Rarer still is the rosy underwing, a recent colonist of the Channel Islands. Mark Tunmore, the founder of Moth Night and editor of the journal Atropos, said: “Already we have been receiving widespread reports of dark and light crimson underwing moths in southern England, indicating that the range expansion of these species is continuing, induced by climate change. “Particularly exciting has been a recent sighting of dark crimson underwing in Gwent, and just a few days ago we received a report of a rosy underwing in Dorset. So we can’t wait to see what happens with so much interest focused on these stunning species over the Moth Night event.” Richard Fox, of Butterfly Conservation, which organises Moth Night with Atropos, Butterfly Conservation and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, said: “Moths are on the move in the UK, with many species in decline, but others, such as the red underwing, are increasing and spreading to new areas. “We need people’s help to find out how far the red underwing has got: has it now colonised Scotland, for example? By taking part in Moth Night, everyone can help.” People can buy humane moth traps, which use special lights to lure moths so they can be identified before they are released the next morning. A simple sheet and a torch, or painting a tree trunk with a “sugar” mix of treacle, brown sugar and brown ale, can also lure in moths. Moth records can be shared and submitted at the mothnight.info website or the event’s Facebook page."
"If you’ve managed to beat the hordes and snag a new bike amid the increase in demand during the coronavirus pandemic, the challenge now is ensuring it survives the growing bicycle thievery problem. There’s no guarantee that any of the measures here will stop your bike from being stolen, but they’ll definitely help. If you’ve just bought a new bike, here’s how to lock it up properly. Don’t buy an amazing bicycle Arguably the strongest anti-theft measure going. A carbon frame and wheelset might make for a quick commute, but your bike will be target number one if it’s seen in the same location day after day. Even if it’s locked up like Fort Knox, a thief only has to be handy with an allen key and cable cutter in order to make off with potentially hundreds of pounds worth of components. The crappier your bike appears, the more likely you are to find it where you left it. If there was ever a better excuse for skipping washing your bike at the weekend, this is it. Use two locks Never lock your bike up with just a cable lock; you’re better off using dental floss. A gold standard D-lock is essential. Stick to brands such as Kryptonite, Oxford, OnGuard or Abus. The Kryptonite Evolution Mini-5 is small enough to be portable but strong enough for quick trips to the shop, park or pub. If you’re leaving a bicycle outside, out of view for longer than an hour, try the Kryptonite Fahgettaboudit or New York Standard. Decent locks are expensive and heavy but thieves would rather go for cheaper, weaker locks. Two D-locks is ideal, but a D-lock with a cable lock for the front wheel should be enough to ensure you return to a bike that’s in one piece. A set of locking security skewers are a good option if you don’t fancy lugging a second lock around with you, and can also be used to secure saddles too. Learn how and where to secure your bike Lock your bike tightly, keeping everything off the ground and leaving no space for power tools, bolt cutters, pry bars or lock pickers. Use your second lock to secure the front wheel to the frame. Leave your bike within eyeshot, among other bikes, somewhere bright and busy where there’s CCTV. Quiet, leafy, posh side streets are never good. Look for dedicated Sheffield stands or cycle hoops. Avoid flimsy racks which only lock the front or rear wheel, wooden posts or trees, and anything your bike can be lifted over. Check whatever you’re locking to hasn’t been cut and covered. (It happens.) Bring your bike inside Going to a friend’s house? Bring your bike in. Going to the pub? Ask if you can leave your bike out of the way in the beer garden. Your work might have a bike/storage room you can use; if they don’t, petition for one. If you live in a tiny flat, congrats on your new piece of bicycle furniture. Alternatively, ask your council to install secure hangers. This might involve befriending your cycling neighbours and getting them behind your cause. Prepare for the worst Make a note of your bicycle’s serial number (it’s on the bottom bracket, underneath the bike), take a few pictures and register it on Bike Register and Immobilise. If it’s lost and found you’ll need to prove it’s yours. If it’s stolen, keep an eye on eBay, Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace. Avoid setting up a sting if it does appear – there’s a chance you’ll be going up against professional bad people and they’ll be far more experienced at this kind of thing than you are. Instead, call the police and let them know you’ve found your bike. Otherwise, bicycle insurance is well worth considering."
"A growing number of “cryptic species” hiding in plain sight have been unmasked in the past year, driven in part by the rise of DNA barcoding, a technique that can identify and differentiate between animal and plant species using their genetic divergence. The discovery of new species of aloe, African leaf-nosed bats and chameleons that appear similar to the human eye but are in fact many and separate have thrilled and worried conservationists. Scientists say our planet might be more biologically diverse than previously thought, and estimates for the total number of species could be far higher than the current best guess of 8.7 million. But cryptic discoveries often mean that species once considered common and widespread are actually several, some of which may be endangered and require immediate protection. The Jonah’s mouse lemur was only unveiled to the world this summer but is already on the verge of extinction. The newly described Popa langur in Myanmar, previously confused with another species, numbers around 200 and is likely to be classified as critically endangered, threatened by habitat loss and deforestation. The discovery of these cryptic species has been driven in part by the rise of DNA barcoding, a technique that can identify and differentiate between animal and plant species using their genetic divergence. African elephants, Indian vine snakes and South American neotropical birds are among the growing number of unmaskings. Thousands more are expected in the coming years, from living creatures and museum samples. “DNA barcoding is a tool that allows us to detect differences among species at a finer scale than before, like a microscope allows us to see fine details of surface structure that are invisible to the naked eye,” says Brian Brown, entomology curator at the LA Natural History Museum, who is using the technique for research on flies. “It gives us a way to delimit some of the previously suspected, but unexplored, diversity within what we call species. It is showing that the world is even more wonderfully biodiverse than we suspected.” The first cryptic species discoveries made using DNA barcoding were in Guanacaste conservation area (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica, now the most DNA barcoded place on Earth. In a paper entitled Ten Species in One, Canadian professor Paul Hebert, known as the “father of DNA barcoding”, revealed the true identities of the two-barred flasher butterfly in 2004, along with University of Pennsylvania professors Daniel Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs, who have dedicated their lives to the ACG. It was an insect that had bothered Janzen for decades. Taxonomic consensus told the 81-year-old evolutionary ecologist that the caterpillar samples he collected in the ACG were those of a common, unremarkable tropical butterfly found from Texas to northern Argentina. But he did not believe it. Janzen had always been puzzled by the diversity of two-barred flasher caterpillars – Astraptes fulgerator – and the variety of plants on which they feasted. So when in 2004 he had the opportunity to test a controversial new technique called DNA barcoding put forward by Hebert (then primarily known for his expertise on water fleas), he knew which insect samples he would send. The results were thrilling. In his study area alone, the barcoding analysis indicated the two-barred flasher butterfly was, in fact, at least 10 genetically distinct species. The revelation of the butterfly as a cryptic species could mean across the rest of Latin America there are thousands of unidentified insect species waiting to be described – along with many that have never been collected and examined. The findings were highly controversial and provoked a backlash from taxonomists and biologists who questioned whether genetic information should be included in identifying a species. Others did not agree that a binary, genetic threshold should be imposed on the continual process of evolution. For centuries, humanity’s understanding of life on Earth was based on the physical form. Every organism in the library of life fits within a hierarchy of classifications based on appearance, according to the modern taxonomic system first developed by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus. “God created, Linnaeus organised,” he immodestly told people. Today, the technique is commonly used alongside traditional Linnaean-based methods, quickly separating samples before further genetic and morphological analysis. Among the sceptics nearly 20 years ago was Brown, who is now responsible for a large unmasking: species once lumped together as Megaselia sulphurizona, a type of humpback fly, also collected in the ACG. DNA barcoding analysis of samples across Latin America revealed 16 separate species, according to his unpublished research with co-authors.  “I thought I could tell my species perfectly well by looking at genitalia,” says Brown, referring to the common practice of identifying insects by studying their reproductive organs. “I didn’t really care if I was going as quickly as possible. But when I started working on this group of small flies, I realised what I was calling one species was actually 16 and that I wasn’t able to identify them morphologically like I thought.” Another convert, Michael Sharkey, an entomologist and emeritus professor at the University of Kentucky, DNA barcoded the insects he had classified for his PhD, only to realise that most of the species concepts he had proposed after three years of hard work were incorrect. “It would have been much better if I had never published. I am happy to have had that experience though; it has taught me that despite best efforts morphological evidence is not sufficient. Barcodes will have their drawbacks as well, but they are a vast improvement,” he wrote of the experience. Either way, the direction of travel is clear. “We’re not going to be looking at genital apertures in beetles in 50 years from now to tell which species were on a tree,” Hebert says. Brown says that if, as he suspects, some species are much rarer than previously thought that only makes conservation efforts more urgent. “I look at my flies and there are maybe 100,000, maybe a million, undescribed species of them in the world. We don’t really know. But if we don’t use methods that take into account genetic divergence, we’re never going to get close to the truth.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"Jordan Ellis was not suited to school. “I couldn’t just sit there and concentrate. I had to mess about. I hate just sitting in the classroom working, listening to the teachers talk. I don’t like getting told what I have to do,” he says. Ellis, 18, still has to follow instructions on his apprenticeship at Future Roots, a care farm in Dorset, but he’s free from the static confines of a classroom and has 30 acres to mess about in. The pleasant smell of rain fills the air when I arrive at the farm on a muggy morning in August. I’m greeted by Future Root’s managing director, Julie Plumley, and her two dogs. Plumley, 57, had the idea for Future Roots in 2008 after working with troubled children as a social worker. She recalls one visit to a local school as we trundle through muddy grass towards her duck pond. Plumley thought the children’s inability to keep still could have been put to good use on the farm she grew up on. “Dad was my hero. So, he was never the best at anything. He was a dairy man, he fixed tractors, he was a builder, he was a plumber; whatever went wrong on the farm dad would just fix it,” she says. “And I was like: ‘God, the farm can teach you something that you might enjoy’.” There are about 250 care farms operating in the UK. They typically offer farming-related activities including animal and plant husbandry, horticulture and land management. Increasingly GPs or community mental health workers can prescribe these farms as part of a care package. Future Roots, like other care farms, has a range of programmes that cater to people with learning difficulties, mental health issues and physical disabilities. It has managed to stay open throughout the pandemic and today is hosting two groups: the Countryman’s Club, a scheme that helps men over the age of 50, who often have degenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, and the Future Farmers course for students aged 14–18. The course teaches basic literacy and numeracy and offers a City & Guilds award in land-based operations. Plumley works with about 20 schools throughout Dorset and neighbouring Somerset and has a team of mentors who have backgrounds in social services, special education and occupational therapy. 70% of Future Root’s funding comes from local authorities and the schools who send their students to the farm. The remaining 30% comes from donations. She says that the kids who come to her are bright, just not academic. “If you speak to their teachers, they’ll tell you they’re aggressive, they’re angry, they’re into drugs, they’re antisocial.” Despite their reputation, Plumley says she’s never had to exclude anyone from the farm and thousands have attended over the past decade. “The kids have said they walk on to this site and they feel safe – they feel that nobody’s going to trap them,” she says. Many of the young people who come to the farm have dependency issues, live or have lived in the care system, and have been excluded from mainstream education. According to research by Bournemouth University, young people attending care farms “displayed a significant reduction in self-reported mental health risks and behavioural regulation difficulties; improved social relationships and coping; improved life and work skills; and re-engagement with learning”. Ellis has finished with the ducks and stops for a brief chat on the way to his next task. Why is the farm better than the classroom? “You’re out in the open, you’re doing stuff physically, working with people who are actually similar to me and got the same problems and their mind works the same,” he says.  Ellis admits he was a “pain in the arse” when he was younger and had a fiery temper. He took drugs and would rob people using knives. “That’s what happens when you mix with the wrong crowd and get into that mindset,” he says. Ellis is now keeping out of trouble and gets his kicks from tearing around the farm on a tractor. Jaryn Taylor, who turned 17 the previous day, is working in the hay barn. “School messed me over bad,” he says, as we perch precariously halfway up a haystack at the barn’s entrance. “I’ve got learning difficulties, so I can’t read and write properly. They did nothing to help. So, I was messing up in all my lessons and I wasn’t learning anything.” Taylor would get frustrated at the lack of help and would abscond in the middle of lessons. “Basically, I’d tell them to fuck off, walk out and go home.” Since coming to the farm three years ago, Taylor’s life looks radically different. He loves to drive the tractors and wants to own his own farm: “I used to hang around in this little group down in town. There’d be fights and I’d get involved and then I started coming here. I just realised I could do good for myself and just stay away from all of them.” The rest of the group are attending to the stars of the farm, a herd of Simmentals – posh cows from Switzerland. Mo (not her real name), 17, was home schooled before she started here four years ago. She can match every calf in the field to its mother and has done the family trees of all the cows. When Mo arrived on the farm she was terrified of the cows and would not go near them. “It was nice to come here and out of the house. It’s helped my confidence a lot,” she says. “I’m a lot less anxious than I used to be. I wasn’t very social. I didn’t really see anyone.” Mo is excelling at her numeracy and literacy and has already completed the land management course. You’d expect a group of socially excluded teenagers to be carrying the weight of the world around with them. Guards up. Heads down. Constricted. But if the young people here were once burdened with such weight they must have left it at the entrance. All are glowing with enthusiasm for their work, for the animals. It probably helps that they have mentors who seem to encourage them, who champion them, who won’t condemn them for having a tizz when it all gets too much. They’re understood here and it shows. But like all farms, Plumley’s is vulnerable to the potentially disastrous implications of the imminent trade deal with the EU. One of the prevailing fears is that cheap food imports and lower standards on agricultural products could destroy domestic farming. “I am afraid for farming being considered unnecessary in the future and [that] we will be totally reliant on other countries,” Plumley says. The centrepiece of the latest agricultural bill is the Environmental Land Management scheme, where farmers can receive subsidies in exchange for meeting environmental standards. Plumley is not impressed: “It will decrease farming opportunities because landowners will keep land to get subsidies not to farm it. I really feel this is wealthy people rewarding themselves as they buy land.” As we walk back to the hay barn we see Ken Barnes and Andy Pollard from the Countryman’s Club singing along to an acoustic rendition of Loch Lomond. Watching from the sidelines are their wives, Sue Barnes and Sue Pollard, who are about to get some well-earned respite from providing full-time care. Ken and Andy were both active ex-farmers and sportsmen. The farm provides them with an opportunity to reclaim part of their former selves. “I got his wellies out this morning and his face just lit up,” Pollard says. Before learning about the farm she says there wasn’t anything available that Andy wanted to do: “This is like a godsend here, you can’t believe the difference it makes. When he comes home after being here, we actually have a conversation.” Barnes shares Pollard’s enthusiasm: “It took me quite a while to bring Ken here because he always had this thing about being with other people who had the same problems as him,” she says. But now her husband loves coming: “He doesn’t want to do anything else but farm. He’s always been like that. It gives me a break so when he comes here, I know he’s safe, I know he’s being looked after.” It’s coming to the end of the day and a few of the Future Farmers are growing restless and have taken to chucking unripened apples around. We gather round in a circle in a shaded spot next to the chicken coops. All of them are past school-leaving age and today they’re deciding if they want to stay on at the farm. All are adamant they want to continue. Studying in classrooms with more than 30 pupils didn’t work for them. Some of them were bullied, while others struggled with the curriculum and acted up as a result, but the farm is working, and they only have to look to Ellis to see where it can take them. Ellis is coming to the end of his apprenticeship and he’ll soon be able to earn more money and save up for the driving lessons he wants to take: “I can’t believe how much I’ve changed to be honest. I think it is this place. I’m out here every day, I don’t have time to do drugs or think of any of that crime stuff.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"Efforts to win endangered species protections for the imperiled Joshua tree in California are encountering entrenched opposition from local officials, who say the added protections may prevent real estate development and economic growth. On Thursday, the California fish and game commission (FGC) will vote on a petition that, if approved, will grant the yucca plants temporary protected status for a year while the agency conducts a study. But local government officials say that granting additional protections to the plant will hinder real estate development and cause undue economic damage. The petition was authored by a local conservationist and grew out of increasing scientific evidence that Joshua trees face existential threats, from urban development and climate change. Brendan Cummings, the conservation director for the Center for Biological Diversity and author of the petition, believes local protections for the Joshua tree are superficial at best and often ignored. He believes local officials’ opposition to granting the Joshua endangered status in the state stems from deference to real estate developments. Since spring, San Bernardino county officials have been outspoken against this proposed listing. Robert Lovingood, a district official who serves a wide swath of the county, warned his constituents it will have a “devastating economic impact” on the high desert region. The Joshua tree – which is not a tree at all but actually a succulent called Yucca brevifolia – grows and reproduces slowly. They are associated with the Mojave desert, and millions of tourists flock annually to see them in national parks and wildlife preserves. But the moths the plants rely on for pollination are becoming more scarce. Wildfires are shrinking the areas where Joshua trees remain. This week, the Dome fire, which sparked on Saturday in the Mojave national preserve, incinerated more than 43,000 acres in some of the world’s densest old-growth Joshua tree forest. Some models predict the plant could be virtually eradicated by the end of the century. In Yucca Valley, a small town north-west of Joshua Tree national park, the city council, the local water district and the mayor have all come out strongly against the petition to study the Joshua tree. The county and Yucca Valley submitted a joint legal brief to FGC stating they “strongly oppose” the move, citing a lack of evidence that Joshua trees are threatened and even argued that “population levels have remained stable or potentially increased over the past 50 years.” Yucca Valley officials cite a local law – requiring residents and businesses to obtain a permit before cutting down any of the succulents on their property – as proof the Joshua tree has ample environmental protection. But a recent public records request – filed by a local retired activist, Ernesto Nevarez – showed the relative ease of obtaining a permit to cut down the yucca plants. Of 147 permit requests the city received in 2020, none have been denied. Nevarez believes this is evidence the city does little to protect the Joshua trees. “After I got the documents, I thought, ‘This is bullshit,’” Nevarez said in a call. He added, “Not one [permit] was declined, there’s no appeal process, there’s no procedural remedy for opponents or proponents of any tree.” Mayor Jeff Drozd has repeatedly argued on social media that further restrictions would bring “red tape, cost and delays” for homeowners but denied charges that he doesn’t care for Joshua trees. “I personally do not oppose protection of Joshua trees, but there is little regard for private property owners,” Drozd said in an email. Speaking to the Desert Sun, he described the possible approval of the petition as “horrible for our town”. But Cummings, the author of the petition, says his goal isn’t to stop development. Moreover, he argues that if his petition passes, it will have positive ripple effects; protections for the Joshua tree will blanket less prominent desert plants and wildlife, such as the endangered desert tortoise. “The Joshua tree, because of its iconic status and because of some of its unique attributes, can be a model of doing climate adaptation planning to ensure that biodiversity of the state is protected,” Cummings said. “Right now, it’s a symbol of our utter failure as a society to address climate change. I’d like to think it can become a symbol of us coming together.”"
"When Kosum Kao-Uthai’s family noticed mysterious imprints in the sand outside the hotel resort they own in Koh Samui, she knew exactly which animal had paid a visit. She remembered spotting the same marks, left by a nesting sea turtle, when, as a teenager, she helped her father farm coconuts on the island. Kosum hadn’t seen another for five decades. Yet, this year, as the coronavirus pandemic emptied Thailand of tourists, nests belonging to endangered hawksbill and green turtles cropped up across the island. Since February, 838 baby turtles have scuttled their way across the island’s sandy beaches and into the sea, with two nests yet to hatch. The surge in nests – 19 so far – has delighted conservationists who have been fighting for years to reduce the threats posed by humans. “It is really exciting and we hope that people in Samui will help us protect the turtles in the future – we have a chance,” says Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, deputy dean at the faculty of fisheries at Kasetsart University in Bangkok. Local people and businesses have rallied to protect the animals, building bamboo fences around nests to shield them from roaming water lizards and dogs. Some have camped next to nests in the hope of spotting the babies hatch, or seeing a mother turtle, who usually returns after a break of 10 or 12 days to lay more eggs. One hotel instructed its security teams to keep a watchful eye, visiting every hour, and redirected CCTV and motion sensors to make sure the eggs were not disturbed. Female turtles typically nest every two to three years, using their flippers to dig a teardrop-shaped cavity in the sand, and lay between 80 and 120 leathery eggs. “They look for areas that are calm and peaceful,” says Thepsuda Loyjiw, a marine biologist working at the Banyan Tree resort, where a green turtle laid five nests this year. “We try to grow the [banyan] plants, because normally they love the trees because of the shade,” she says, adding that the turtles usually nest at night. It’s not clear if turtles that may have been put off from nesting on crowded Samui beaches in previous years might have travelled elsewhere to nest. It’s possible that they released the eggs in the water, and they failed to hatch, says Thon. “The eggs inside the sea turtle cannot wait. It’s like humans – if you need to give birth, you will give birth in the taxi,” he says.  The number of sea turtles in Thailand’s waters has fallen drastically over the past century. Samui was a completely different place 50 years ago, says Kosum: “It was only wooden forests, coconut farms and there was no road.” Now the island has more than 2 million visitors in a good year. It’s not just the development of beaches that poses a threat to turtles. Other dangers include poaching, pollution and the risks posed by fishing nets. Around the world, their future is increasingly threatened by global heating, as hotter temperatures contribute to rising sea levels and storms, changing ocean currents and harming the coral reefs on which many depend for survival. There is also growing concern about the impact of the climate crisis on the sex ratio of turtles: the warmer the sand in which eggs are buried, the more likely the offspring will develop into a female. In Thailand, conservation experts are finding new ways to monitor the species. Over recent months, the Phuket Marine Biological Centre has tracked a hawksbill mother turtle that laid eggs on Samui, in an attempt to discover more about how her route can be better protected. “If you want to conserve any animal you have to know their life cycle and habitat,” says Dr Kongkiat Kittiwatanawong, the centre’s director. Facial recognition technology that identifies turtles is also being developed. It is hoped that this could help generate more accurate estimates of numbers, as turtles are difficult to count because of their migration patterns. The number of nests reported on Samui in 2020 is far higher than any other year on record – though veterinary reports only date back to 2012. No one knows what will happen when the island sees the return of tourists, which so many businesses depend upon. “Before [the pandemic] it was full, the parking area was full,” says Kosum, adding that the family business has become increasingly hard to run.  Thon hopes a balance can be struck. The pandemic has illustrated that Samui is an important nesting ground for the species, and the pause in tourism caused by the pandemic is a chance to act, he says. “We have to.”"
"Scientists have developed a method to 3D-print greener buildings using local soil that they say has the potential to revolutionise the construction industry. The technology is designed to be a sustainable alternative to concrete, which accounts for approximately 7% of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. Sarbajit Banerjee, a professor of chemistry and materials science and engineering at Texas A&M University, said 3D printing enabled a versatility that allowed them to print entire architectural facades, although getting such structures to meet existing building regulations remained a significant challenge. Concrete remains the primary material used in many construction projects but it cannot be recycled and requires a lot of energy to mix and transport. The research team’s aim is to print structures using the type of soil that can be found in any garden. “While the widespread use of concrete has democratised access to housing and enabled the growth of cities, this has come at a considerable environmental cost,” said Banerjee. “The move to 3D-print concrete threatens to exacerbate this problem. However, we envision a new paradigm of construction that uses naturally sourced materials. Using such materials will further pave the way for building designs that are specifically adapted to the needs of local climates, instead of cookie-cutter houses. “We see this as a means of providing dignified habitats to some of the neediest populations across the world.” What’s more, the use of local materials would reduce the need to transport concrete long distances, further reducing the environmental impact of the buildings. The research team’s plan to replace concrete with the earth beneath our feet depends on their ability to improve soil’s load-bearing capabilities, to which Banerjee said they “are making excellent progress”.  Once they have a clearer idea of the limits of the technology, Banerjee and his team plan to investigate how it might allow for building on other planets. “We see this research not just as a means of replacing concrete but allowing for construction in difficult environments. For instance, we have worked on addressing the problem of building all-weather roads in the subarctic. [The technology] could one day be used beyond Earth, to create settlements on the moon or even Mars.”"
"Expensive prices for electric cars could hold back the UK’s transition from fossil fuel vehicles, the industry has warned, amid signs that demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is waning. The premium paid for electric cars is a concern for more than half of UK consumers, according to a poll conducted on behalf of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK car industry lobby group.  Despite government subsidies, battery electric cars are still more expensive than those burning petrol or diesel, but carmakers are scrambling to ramp up production and sales in order to meet the new restrictions on emissions that came in this year. Sales of new battery electric cars have almost tripled to 39,000 in the year to July, but there are signs that demand is falling back. Data from online marketplace Auto Trader show that the average asking price for electric cars fell 5.2% in the year to August. Ian Plummer, Auto Trader’s commercial director, said the higher “upfront retail price of EVs is somewhat off-putting” for consumers, despite the potential savings from their cheaper running costs. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “Until these vehicles are as affordable to buy and as easy to own and operate as conventional cars, we risk the UK being in the slow lane, undermining industry investment and holding back progress.” The SMMT has been calling for the UK government to broaden the subsidies offered to buyers of new electric cars to include plug-in hybrid vehicles. The withdrawal of subsidies from plug-in hybrids last year prompted a furious reaction from the industry, which argues the controversial technology, which combines an internal combustion engine with a battery, is a crucial stepping stone for consumers. However, environmental groups argue that the best way to accelerate consumer take-up of electric cars is to bring forward bans on internal combustion engines. The government is committed to banning polluting carbon dioxide-emitting engines by 2040, but is considering moving that forward to 2035 or even as early as 2032. Both the industry and environmental groups are united in calling for a dramatic increase in investment in charging points to make it more attractive for consumers around the country to switch to electric cars. The UK will require as many as 1.7m on-street electric car charging points by the end of the decade, and a further 1.1m by 2035, in order to allow for a zero-emissions car fleet, according to analysis by the SMMT and consultancy Frost and Sullivan. That would equate to more than 500 new charge points per day over 15 years."
"Maritime authorities in Spain have warned sailors off the coast of Galicia to give orcas a wide berth after a naval yacht lost part of its rudder following a brush with two of the whales and a similar incident left a French boat with minor damage. Both encounters took place hours apart on Sunday in the Rías Baixas area of north-west Spain. The French boat was found to have marks consistent with the orcas rubbing against its hull, while the Mirfak – a Spanish naval yacht en route to a regatta – lost part of its rudder after the boat attracted the animals’ attention. A video shot by the one of the Mirfak’s crew shows the animals swimming alongside and underneath the boat before the sailors realise the rudder has been damaged. On Monday, Spain’s maritime rescue service warned vessels in the area of the presence of the orcas, and asked sailors “to keep their distance, give them a lot of leeway and inform the coastguard”. Experts from the Co-ordinator for the Study of Marine Mammals (Cemma) in the Galician town of Nigrán are investigating the episodes, which they describe as highly unusual. Alfredo López, a biologist at Cemma, said orcas were usually spotted off Galicia in September each year when the whales make their way up from the Gulf of Cádiz and follow tuna into the Bay of Biscay. “We’re looking into the matter but we don’t yet have all the information we need to draw a clear conclusion,” López told the Guardian. He said the “interaction” with the French boat had taken place at about midday on Sunday, while the Mirfak had encountered the orcas about five hours later in the same area. “We managed to get a look at the French boat, which showed evidence of contact, of the animal brushing up against the hull, but there was no evidence of structural damage in that case,” he said. “The navy boat seems to have broken its rudder, but we’re waiting to see if they’ll let us examine it and the rest of the boat.” López said he and his colleagues were in touch with teams in Portugal to check through similar cases there and to determine whether the same animals were involved. He added: “These interactions are very rare and aren’t something we’ve seen here before.” Orcas, also known as killer whales, can weight up to six tonnes and live for up to 80 years."
"Narrow lanes running west reflect the low sun, where asphalt is dampened by seeping springs and moss revives along the centres. Clusters of browning keys weigh down the ominously thin crowns of ash, and withered beech leaves accumulate in shallow drifts; immature hazelnuts have blown off, gobbled up by squirrels. Sufficient rain has ensured heavier crops of second-cut silage, in contrast to the meagre production of early summer. Grass regrows vigorously on vacated pastures; swirling flocks of jackdaws peck over softened ground before beef cattle are brought back from adjoining fields for another grazing session. South from home, minor roads between high banks lead downhill towards the tidal river. Cuttings excavated through contorted slate help reduce the gradient and made these routes suitable for horse-drawn heavy wagons, carting local produce towards steamers that called in en route to North Corner in Plymouth, there to be unloaded for Devonport market. Lime was also dragged uphill from the kilns at Halton Quay, worked from as early as 1411 and last burned in 1916, for the reclamation of Viverdon Down, which needed lime to be ploughed into the acidic soil. On this quiet evening, stubble fields inside rutted muddy gateways are overrun with pheasants, at liberty before the shooting season. Lower down, tailless poults scuttle across steep land, opposite woods on Mount Ararat and overlooking Hornifast Marsh. Derelict market gardens still grow eucalyptus for the blue foliage used by the cut-flower trade and, in a nearby community orchard, branches on young fruit trees droop with heavy crops of apples and pears. A few gaunt cherry trees survive, almost dead, overwhelmed in ivy topped with strands of scarlet rosehips. Close to the river, old man’s beard – characteristic of chalky soil – benefits from the once-important lime trade; tendrils of its fluffy seeds scramble among bright red haws, smother hedges and tangle the purple flowering reeds at the confluence with the stream from Dairymill. Smooth river water is a mirror for sky, mud banks, reedbeds and darkening woods on the Pentillie meander, and from up-river comes the clacking sound of a gig’s oars, out on a run from Cotehele Quay."
"The government’s badger cull is being expanded to 11 new areas of England including parts of Oxfordshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire so that more than 60,000 badgers can be killed. Conservation groups said the expansion was a betrayal of trust after the government this year pledged to phase out the badger cull, intended to reduce bovine TB in cattle, after a scientific review cast doubt on its efficacy. Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: “The decision to expand the badger cull is a huge betrayal of public trust by the government. Despite responding to the Sir Charles Godfray TB Review in March with a clear commitment to phase out badger culling in favour of TB vaccination of badgers and cattle, the government is now embarking on a mass destruction of badgers, which is little more than ecological vandalism on an unprecedented scale.” Jo Smith, the chief executive of Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, also condemned the decision. “This is a staggering government U-turn and one which will result in thousands of healthy badgers being shot across England this autumn. “We are at a critical turning point for our natural world and this latest U-turn should set alarm bells ringing. Culling is an outdated policy that seeks to eradicate protected wildlife rather than addressing the real problem which is the main cause of bovine tuberculosis: cattle-to-cattle infection.” Bovine TB causes more than 30,000 cattle to be prematurely slaughtered in England each year, but the contribution of badgers to the disease’s spread is disputed and not precisely understood by science. When the culls began in 2013, 26,594 infected cows were prematurely slaughtered in England. In 2018, 32,925 cows were slaughtered because of the disease. For the first time, culling – including cage-trapping and “free shooting” – will take place this autumn in Derbyshire, Warwickshire, Shropshire and Oxfordshire, where successful badger vaccination projects are under way. Vaccinating badgers has been shown to reduce bovine TB in badger populations. The government has yet to respond to a formal complaint that the cull breaches the Bern convention, while the humaneness of the shooting of free-running badgers allowed under cull licences is being challenged in the high court. The Badger Trust said the government had yet to publish any reliable scientific evidence that culling was reducing TB in cattle, but the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said peer-reviewed research showed reductions in new cattle TB outbreaks of 66% in Gloucestershire and 37% in Somerset. Stuart Roberts, deputy president of the union, said: “The NFU has always supported the government’s 25-year eradication strategy, which provides farmers with a lifeline for tackling bovine TB, and using all available measures to tackle this horrendous disease, including strengthening cattle movements, enhanced biosecurity and controlling the disease in wildlife. “The chief vet has said that proactive badger culling is currently the best available option to tackle this disease and there is clear evidence that badger culling is working.” But critics point out that the 66% reduction in Gloucestershire was followed by a 130% increase the following year. Iain McGill, a vet who signed an open letter to Boris Johnson in the Veterinary Record, alongside Jane Goodall, Chris Packham and others, said the real cause of bovine TB in cattle was infected cows going undetected by the existing skin test, which picks up only half of those with infections. “This shames the veterinary profession to its very core,” he said.  The government said it still intended to phase out “intensive badger culling in the next few years, while ensuring that wildlife control remains a tool that can be deployed where the scientific evidence supports it”. It recently announced long-awaited trials of a bovine TB cattle vaccine and awarded £500,000 in grants for projects to devise new tools to better diagnose the disease in cattle. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said: “Bovine TB is one of the most difficult and intractable animal health challenges that the UK faces today, causing considerable trauma for farmers and costing taxpayers over £100m every year. “No one wants to continue the cull of a protected species indefinitely. That is why we are accelerating other elements of our strategy, including vaccination and improved testing, so that we can eradicate this insidious disease and start to phase out badger culling in England.”"
"Health experts have warned that delays to proposed clean air zones in cities including Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds pose a risk to the nation’s wellbeing. Clean air zones (CAZs) are areas in which drivers of polluting vehicles are charged to enter city centres in an effort to improve air quality. With air pollution at illegal levels in many locations for the past decade, causing thousands of deaths a year, local authorities nationwide had announced plans to introduce the zones. But the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in fewer vehicles on the road during lockdown, has led pollution levels to fall. The funding available to local authorities is designed to bring air pollution below legal limits, so some local authorities have been hesitant to proceed while pollution levels remain relatively low. Birmingham’s CAZ was originally scheduled for 2020, but has been delayed until next year, and the council is expected to announce the exact date later this autumn. A spokesperson said: “Birmingham remains committed to launching its clean air zone in 2021.” Sheffield and Bristol have also delayed their CAZs. According to Sheffield city council, the city’s air pollution in January-August this year was 33% lower than the same period in 2019. The government is working with cities on the zones through its Joint Air Quality Unit, managed by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Transport. Sheffield council’s cabinet member for transport, Bob Johnson, said: “Following on from the lockdown required to control the spread of the virus, there have been a number of changes to travel behaviour which has led to improvements in air quality. The current situation is dramatically different to the one in which our proposals were originally developed.” He said the economic uncertainty arising from the pandemic meant the proposed CAZ needed to be reviewed. “If we can hold on to clean air by introducing other measures without resorting to charging people, we believe this is the best way forward,” said Johnson.  James Lewis, deputy leader of Leeds city council, said: “If the city’s air pollution is expected to stay below legal limits then we will no longer have the support of the government to introduce a charging clean air zone. Given this uncertainty, our financial support will continue to be paused until the review is complete and we have received further direction.” The city’s plans remain suspended indefinitely. Greater Manchester was expected to conduct a public consultation into its own CAZ this summer but it will instead take place next month. Andrew Western, the councillor leading the city’s plans to improve air quality, said: “We will use the feedback from the consultation process to inform our final plans and understand how best to ensure our residents are not exposed to illegal levels of air pollution.” “Lockdown led to a huge improvement in air quality across our city-region,” he added. “It also showed that better air quality is achievable, and that vehicle emissions are the key to reducing NO2 exposure.” About 800,000 people a year across Europe are estimated to die prematurely because of air pollution. The latest round of delays has led some environmental campaigners to question the government’s commitment to reducing air pollution. Katie Nield, a lawyer at the environmental charity ClientEarth, said: “Clean air zones are the key to reducing illegal and harmful levels of pollution in our towns and cities. Resisting and delaying these much-needed measures is shortsighted and adds an unnecessary risk to respiratory health as we grapple with Covid-19. “It’s not really clear where these U-turns originate. In some cases councils are suggesting central government is behind these delays, while ministers are remaining tight-lipped. The public deserve better. Ultimately it is the UK government’s responsibility to make sure that the necessary work is done to tackle this public health crisis. They are already a decade behind – people’s health should not have to wait any longer.” A Defra spokesperson said: “We remain committed to cleaning up our air and are providing £880m in funding and expert support to local authorities so they can develop innovative plans that work best for their areas.”"
"Spuds, tatties, taters – the time to unearth these magic tubers had come. Summer’s heaviest harvesting was under way in billows of dust, rolling tractors and trailer upon laden trailer bound for welcoming barns. Almost five months before, I had stood at this same field corner looking over newly ploughed soil, the fine tilth sculpted into a corrugated landscape of hillocks and hollows. A pair of yellow wagtails flitted from top to top, and in any other year those lemony migrants from Africa would have been the highlight of my walk. But that day I gained more exhilaration from a quartet of wooden crates parked at the end of the field. Each of the waist-high tubs was filled to the brim with seed potatoes, and each peach-sized pellet was destined to be sunk into the raised banks of soil and grow offspring a dozen or so times its own weight. On that day, when the supermarket shelves were empty of flour, pasta and rice, and in that period of perpetual doubt, I glowed in the certainty that, come autumn, there would be still be mash for tea. Over spring and summer, I nursed this crop with my eyes, watched it watered by farm irrigators and downpours. I walked its length and width to estimate how many potatoes lay beneath. When the plant tops were raked off by tractor, I knew there was a fortnight to go, 14 days for the buried skins to harden. Two tractors came down the lines in parallel. One was a taker, the other a receiver. The former, with wheels in the gutters on either side, used spinning wheels to throw up the banked earth into a pouch. The contents bounced on to a quaking conveyer belt, which shook off the soil, and nudged the potatoes up its crane-like stem. At the end of the belt, a funnel sent a continuous stream of tatties raining down into a trailer pulled by the accompanying tractor. Two small potatoes had spilled out on the concrete track. They were in the path of huge tractor tyres that would crush them as they turned. I scooped them up – just enough for a lunch. In the field before me were a hundred thousand dinners."
"A veteran Australian forestry scientist has launched a blistering attack on his professional association after it used the retraction of a scientific paper to dismiss links between logging and increased bushfire risks. In an open letter to the Institute of Foresters Australia seen by Guardian Australia, Dr John Dargavel said the institute’s reaction “damages our standing” and “demeans all foresters in the public eye”. Dargavel, who is retired but remains an associate professor at the Fenner school of environment and society at the Australian National University, got his first role in forestry in 1956 and has edited and written books about the history of the profession in Australia and the world. The institute says it has about 1,000 members, and describes itself as a “professional association for foresters, private forestry, commercial tree growing and all forestry professionals”. Dargavel wrote: “We cannot afford to continue to present ourselves as a blustering, reactive, negative profession, when the heart of forestry offers positive hope for the future.” Earlier this week the institute said it was seeking an apology “over the standard of the [University of Tasmania’s] review process” after the research, produced by three university scientists, was withdrawn. Its president, Bob Gordon, also claimed the paper was retracted after third parties had contacted the journal. However, the journal’s editor told Guardian Australia the researchers had asked the journal to withdraw the paper. The research paper had examined satellite images of Tasmania’s Huon Valley before and after fires in early 2019, but a mistake was made in categorising the types of trees burned – some of which were in plantations and not native forests. The withdrawal prompted a flurry of public statements from politicians and logging industry groups attacking the scientists. Tasmania’s resources minister, Guy Barnett, and the Australian Forest Products Association both claimed there was a “scientific consensus” that there was no link between logging and the risk of more dangerous bushfires – an assertion rejected by some experts. Dargavel wrote that “some of the institute’s public commentary debases our standing as an independent professional association”. Its attack on the university “is negative and repeats the carping, anti-academic tenor of several of the [institute’s] media statements of recent years”. The institute’s focus on the university was misdirected: “Journals, not universities, run the review process for articles. “Asking the university for an apology is pointless because academics have individual freedom to publish. No doubt the authors are already mortified that they had made an error. They and the journal acted correctly in retracting the paper.” Dargavel said he felt the institute was taking “an incredibly negative approach” and was alienating a public that it should be trying to connect with”.  He sent his letter to the institute’s chief executive and Gordon with a request it be disseminated to members. Responding to the letter, the institute said: “While we thoroughly respect the right of members to express their view, we stand by our comments.” Prof Rod Keenan, chair of forest and ecosystem science at the University of Melbourne and an institute member, described Dargavel as an “elder statesman” for forestry science. He had read the letter and agreed the institute should be pushing for more science on the relationships between forestry and bushfires. “I support [Dargavel’s] call for a focus on the science,” he said, adding the institute was better to focus on those issues rather than political conflict."
"The scene could hardly be more idyllic. A broad grassy bank next to a clear, burbling river. Downstream from the stone bridge, herons patrol the shallows, while deer, wild ponies and cattle trot down the hillside in the early autumn sunshine for a drink. This spot at Bellever in the heart of Dartmoor was very different at the height of the summer, when hundreds of “fly-campers” descended from across the UK with tents, gazebos, music systems, fairy lights and generators to grab a taste of post-lockdown freedom. They collected wood and lit fires, putting the environment and precious bronze-age archaeological sites at risk. The gorse bushes that dot the slopes were turned into makeshift toilets, the woods became the site of raves. At one point, 60 groups were crammed together on the Devon riverbank. “It was horrendous,” said Simon Lee, Dartmoor National Park ranger team manager. “This is a wonderful spot and I understand why people would want to camp but they were just not doing it the right way. It was loud and very messy. There was rubbish all over the place, human excrement in the gorse bushes, more than 100 fire pits dug into the ground.” A great deal of work has been done to restore the site and make sure wildlife, including otters and salmon, do not suffer long-term impact. But look closely and evidence of the summer excess lingers. The scars of the fire-pits are obvious and detritus – a child’s flip-flop, an adult’s trainer, a plastic bag – washes up from time to time on the banks of the East Dart River. Because of the Covid crisis, huge numbers of UK people headed to the countryside with their tents and barbecues, putting flora and fauna at risk, not to the mention the peace of human residents. Social media means hidden spots do not stay hidden for long. Dartmoor was a particular problem because it is one of the few places in England where wild or backpack camping is allowed in some places. However, it is not a free-for-all. The rule is that you can camp as part of a hike. You have to carry your own equipment and stay a maximum of two nights. Your camp site should be 100m from the nearest road, out of sight and you should leave no trace. Large tents and big groups are not allowed and no open fires or barbecues permitted. The rangers have a delicate balancing act. They want to attract people to the park but the false idea that Dartmoor was a free campsite seems to have taken hold. “I don’t think people quite grasped the concept of wild camping,” said Martin Jones, a plumber and keen wild camper who lives close to the Bellever spot. “It was just terrible here in the summer. We had to put up with a mini-rave in the summer in the forestry land, boy racers coming down the lane and the whole place was turned into a toilet. You were more likely to get cholera than Covid around here.” He has particularly missed the churring, ventriloquial call of the nightjar, a nocturnal bird that usually hawks for food at dawn and dusk at Bellever. “They vanished when the campers came,” said Jones. “I don’t think we had as many swallows and house martins this summer either. I hope they’ll be back.” So critical was the situation that the park authority invoked a section of the Dartmoor Common Act 1985 to ban camping at Bellever and on the high ground above it, Riddon Ridge, from 7 August to 2 September. Marshals were employed to work with rangers to patrol the riverbanks and hillsides. The ban ended this week but the rangers are still asking people not to camp at Bellever and the Riddon Ridge for the rest of the year and the marshals remain on patrol.  Vanessa and Björn Michael, from Bedfordshire, were among the first to return to the Bellever spot following the end of the ban. They have camped here before, though not this summer. “It’s a lovely spot. We follow the leave no trace rules and stay invisible.” They arrived with tent and firewood but confronted by signs informing them that this remain a “wildlife recovery zone”, they passed by and went to find another spot, melting in the landscape. As dusk fell, tents began to appear on Dartmoor, not at Bellever but on other spots across the moor, a number clearly visible from the road. Campers Jon Foot and Dawn McGeorge had travelled from Dumfries and Galloway to meet family from Devon on the moor. They were tucked away in a hollow and were to be found cooking halloumi and veggie sausages as they took in the sunset. Asked what the draw was, Foot pointed out the bright red sky and the first stars. “There’s nothing better than getting out into a landscape like this. It’s wonderful to be out here in the wild.” The concern is that if the crowds continue to converge on spots like Bellever, the spirit of wild or backpack camping on Dartmoor will be lost for ever."
"The extractive industries have their sights set on Nova Scotia as a literal goldmine, and decades of conservation efforts – as well the future of a beloved river – hang in the balance. Three years after Atlantic Gold opened a goldmine north-east of Halifax, the mining company intends to open three more across Nova Scotia. One of the mines has been proposed alongside the St Mary’s River, Nova Scotia’s longest single waterway – and in the opinions of many, its wildest, supporting both endangered species and ecosystems. This, the so-called Cochrane Hill goldmine, has become the focal point of mounting public opposition to goldmining in Nova Scotia. “To put a mine [on the St Mary’s] is a terrible idea,” said Charlotte Connolly, campaign coordinator with the Ecology Action Centre, an environmental advocacy group based in Nova Scotia. All three proposed mines are under joint federal and provincial environmental review. But according to Connolly, the provincial government has already given Atlantic Gold a warm welcome, publicly touting the economic benefits of goldmining to Nova Scotians and offering a very low royalty rate – a fee charged to any company profiting from a public resource. Very few new mines in Canada fail to receive federal approval according to Jamie Kneen, who handles communications for MiningWatch Canada, a coalition that promotes sustainable mining practices. Over time, Kneen says, as rare metal deposits became scarce, mines have become bigger in order to harvest smaller fragments of gold. Some – like Cochrane Hill – are increasingly situated in vulnerable ecosystems, such as on the banks of major rivers. “Consider the St Mary’s River,” he said. “Do you really want to mess with that? Even if you accept all [of Atlantic Gold’s] promises - that there’s a low probability of a serious problem – the consequences [of toxic waste] are still huge.” The “wildness” of the St Mary’s River is in part due to its unusual concentration of old growth and floodplain forests, which have grown relatively undisturbed for centuries. These forests are storehouses of provincial biodiversity, such as wood turtles and rare lichen, and there are precious few left in Nova Scotia. The St Mary’s has been the subject of intense conservation efforts for decades. The St Mary’s River Association was established in 1979 to protect and restore the river’s once-famous salmon fishery – visited by such celebrities as Babe Ruth and Michael J Fox – and has spent decades building fish ladders and monitoring the health of the ecosystem and resident fish. Since 2014, it has dedicated $1.1m to rebuilding riverbanks and spawning habitat pulverized by log drives, and just last year received another $1.2m to shield the river from acid rain. In recent years, members of the association have noticed the number of salmon nests growing dramatically in the stretches of river they have restored. Slowly but surely, it seems salmon are returning to the St Mary’s. “This is starting to become a major natural corridor,” said Bonnie Sutherland, executive director of the Nova Scotia Nature Trust, which has privately protected over 600 hectares of old growth and floodplain forest along the river. “It’s pretty ironic that this proposed mine is coming at the height of conservation achievement on this river.” In addition to these private efforts, the provincial government has committed to protecting thousands of hectares along the river, turning them into forthcoming provincial parks, wilderness areas and nature reserves. The Cochrane Hill mine, as proposed, would draw water for gold processing from one such forthcoming wilderness area. But once the provincial government officially establishes a wilderness area, it cannot be used by the mine in any way, said Chris Miller of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society. Conservationists have flagged multiple other issues with Atlantic Gold’s planned construction: it would drain its treated effluent – which may contain mercury and arsenic, according to Michael Parsons of Natural Resources Canada – through McKeens Brook, which the St Mary’s River Association believes is among the most productive salmon-spawning habitats on the entire river. The mine’s construction would also necessitate rerouting a nearby highway through land protected by the Nova Scotia Nature Trust – probably destroying old growth forests that the trust is mandated to protect. In order for the highway to be rerouted, according to members of the trust, the province would have to seize the land for public use through a controversial mechanism called expropriation. “Expropriation would be wrong on so many levels,” said Sutherland. Nova Scotia’s department of environment declined to comment directly on the potential for expropriation until the proposed mine’s environmental review has been completed. The department said public comment would be invited at that time. “Our company is still completing studies to optimize the plan for the proposed Cochrane Hill goldmine,” said St Barbara, parent company of Atlantic Gold, in a statement to the Guardian. “St Barbara greatly respects the work of local groups to protect and grow spawning habitat of Atlantic salmon and other aquatic and terrestrial life around the St Mary’s River. In line with our commitment to respecting the environment, we have invested a significant amount of time and funding to study all possible impacts our operations could have on the local environment, including water tables and aquatic habitat. We have also assessed how best we can effectively mitigate any possible impacts.” Kneen, from MiningWatch Canada, said that even when mines have been exhausted, they will have to be monitored forever in order to avoid contamination of water and soil. When contamination does occur, Kneen said Canada had a very poor record of holding companies to account, and there were few legal remedies for Canadian citizens or communities to do so themselves. “Like everyone else, we’re trying to navigate our way through the pandemic, while trying to keep the goldmine fight front and centre,” said Scott Beaver, president of the St Mary’s River Association. “If they push a mine through to the St Mary’s, there’s no place in Nova Scotia, in my mind, that can be protected from mining. The St Mary’s is a sacred spot.”"
"Scientists are to warn world leaders that increasing numbers of deadly new pandemics will afflict the planet if levels of deforestation and biodiversity loss continue at their current catastrophic rates. A UN summit on biodiversity, scheduled to be held in New York next month, will be told by conservationists and biologists there is now clear evidence of a strong link between environmental destruction and the increased emergence of deadly new diseases such as Covid-19. Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of farming and the building of mines in remote regions – as well as the exploitation of wild animals as sources of food, traditional medicines and exotic pets – are creating a “perfect storm” for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people, delegates will be told. Almost a third of all emerging diseases have originated through the process of land use change, it is claimed. As a result, five or six new epidemics a year could soon affect Earth’s population. “There are now a whole raft of activities – illegal logging, clearing and mining – with associated international trades in bushmeat and exotic pets that have created this crisis,” said Stuart Pimm, professor of conservation at Duke University. “In the case of Covid-19, it has cost the world trillions of dollars and already killed almost a million people, so clearly urgent action is needed.” It is estimated that tens of millions of hectares of rainforest and other wild environments are being bulldozed every year to cultivate palm trees, farm cattle, extract oil and provide access to mines and mineral deposits. This leads to the widespread destruction of vegetation and wildlife that are hosts to countless species of viruses and bacteria, most unknown to science. Those microbes can then accidentally infect new hosts, such as humans and domestic livestock. Such events are known as spillovers. Crucially, if viruses thrive in their new human hosts they can infect other individuals. This is known as transmission and the result can be a new, emerging disease. An example of such events is provided by the HIV virus, which in the early 20th century spread from chimpanzees and gorillas – which were being slaughtered for bushmeat in West Africa – to men and women and which has since caused the death of more than 10 million people. Other examples include Ebola fever, which is passed on by bats to primates and humans; the swine flu epidemic of 2009 and the Covid-19 virus, which was originally passed to humans from bats. “When workers come into rainforests to chop down trees they don’t take food with them,” said Andy Dobson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University. “They just eat what they can kill. So that exposes them to infection all the time.” This point was backed by Pimm. “I have a photograph of a guy slaughtering a wild pig deep in the Ecuadorian jungle. He was an illegal logger and he and his fellow workers needed food so they killed a boar. They got splattered with wild pig blood in the process. It’s gruesome and unhygienic and that is how these diseases spread.” However, not every emerging disease is caused by a single, major spillover event, stressed zoologist David Redding, of University College London. “In places where trees are being cleared, mosaics of fields, created around farms, appear in the landscape interspersed with parcels of old forest. “This increases the interface between the wild and the cultivated. Bats, rodents and other pests carrying strange new viruses come from surviving clumps of forests and infect farm animals – who then pass on these infections to humans.” An example of this form of transmission is provided by Lassa fever, which was first discovered in Nigeria in 1969 and now causes several thousand deaths a year. The virus is spread by the rodent Mastomys natalensis, which was widespread in Africa’s savannahs and forests but now colonises homes and farms, passing on the disease to humans. “The crucial point is that there are probably 10 times more different species of viruses than there are of mammals,” added Dobson. “The numbers are against us and the emergence of new pathogens inevitable.” In the past many outbreaks of new diseases remained in contained areas. However, the development of cheap air travel has changed that picture and diseases can appear across the globe before scientists have fully realised what is happening. “The onward transmission of a new disease is also another really important element in the pandemic story,” said Professor James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University. “Consider the swine flu pandemic. We flew that around the world several times before we realised what was going on. Global connectivity has allowed – and is still allowing – Covid-19 to be transmitted to just about every country on Earth.” In a paper published in Science last month, Pimm, Dobson and other scientists and economists propose setting up a programme to monitor wildlife, reduce spillovers, end the wildlife meat trade and reduce deforestation. Such a scheme could cost more than $20bn a year, a price tag that is dwarfed by the cost of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has wiped trillions of dollars from national economies round the world. “We estimate that the value of prevention costs for 10 years to be only about 2% of the costs of the Covid-19 pandemic,” they state. In addition, reducing deforestation – which is a major source of carbon emissions – would also have the benefit of helping the battle against climate change, add the researchers. “The rate of emergence of novel disease is increasing and their economic impacts are also increasing,” states the group. “Postponing a global strategy to reduce pandemic risk would lead to continued soaring costs. Society must strive to avoid the impacts of future pandemics.”"
"The Coalition is being urged to not push through changes to conservation laws that would transfer more development approval powers to the states unless it plans to also introduce promised new national environmental standards. There is growing concern a bill due to be introduced to parliament this week will not include the new standards, which were promised last month by the environment minister, Sussan Ley. National environmental standards were one of the key recommendations of the interim report from a review of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The review’s chair, the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, said the standards could underpin a devolution of development approval powers from Canberra to the states and territories. Ley said in July that prototype standards would be introduced in August at the same time as a bill to streamline the approvals system. But in a meeting with environment groups this week, the minister said the bill to be introduced this week did not include standards, according to multiple people at the meeting. Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said: “It is only fair that Australians should see the proposed standards before the parliament is asked to vote on any amendment to the environmental law. “When the report was published, Sussan Ley said the standards would be introduced at the same time as the legislation. She referred to “strong rigorous environmental standards” that had “buy-in across the board”. “She should stay true to her word and not pursue amendments until the standards are negotiated and made available to the people of Australia.” Butler said there would be concern if the Morrison government introduced legislation similar to the Coalition’s one-stop-shop proposal that was defeated in 2015. Labor, the Greens and some of the crossbench have expressed alarm that changes to laws are being rushed before Samuel has handed down his final report, due in October. Government and One Nation senators voted to block a Greens motion on Wednesday that would have prevented the government’s bill from being debated in the Senate until the final report is delivered or a consultative committee discussing the development of national standards reached agreement. Guardian Australia asked Ley if the government planned to meet its commitment to introduce prototype standards at the same time as its streamlining bill. “The bilateral agreements will include commonwealth standards,” a spokesman said. “There will be further legislation as a result of Professor Samuel’s consultation process.” Rachel Walmsley, the policy and law reform director at the Environmental Defenders Office, said a potential outcome was that national standards would be attached as an appendix to each bilateral agreement as those agreements were negotiated with the states. “From a legal point of view, that’s very concerning,” she said. “Graeme Samuel’s interim report said that national standards will be regulatory instruments with regulatory functions. “That’s different to something that is an appendix to an agreement. For that to actually have (legal) force, the only recourse there would be for the minister to exercise a call-in power or for the minister to suspend accreditation.” Walmsley said a bill that simply moved to streamline and fast-track development approvals would not bring the improvements Samuel’s report found were necessary to stem an unsustainable rate of environmental decline. The report recommended three phases for reform, beginning with interim standards and steps to establish bilateral processes. The final phase called for a complete overhaul of the act with “a full suite of national environmental standards”, an independent law enforcement regulator, and systems that protect and restore the environment. “All of that could be completely undermined if a bill goes through now that hands power to the states with no enforceable standards or safeguards,” Walmsley said. The Greens environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said Australians wanted to see the country’s environment protected. “We should not be dealing with any of this legislation until we have a copy of that final report,” she said. “It’s about good process, it’s about scrutiny and it’s about protecting Australia’s environment.” Senator Rex Patrick said he believed the government should wait until the final report was released before bringing legislation for debate. “Before being asked to vote on any amendments to the EPBC Act it’s important that senators are well informed,” he said. “As such, we should have access to the final independent review before any vote takes place.”"
"The drought in the east, extreme rains in the west and now the wind all over have taken their toll on the final few faded meadow browns still heroically jinking through the flowerless meadows. I’m enjoying pristine red admirals on my late-flowering buddleias, the rare and handsome brown hairstreak (the last species to emerge each summer) continues to flourish and there are large whites a-plenty, but we’ve definitely passed peak butterfly. The season is not quite over yet, however. Some exciting migrants, such as clouded yellows and long-tailed blues may continue along the south coast into October. And thanks to the glorious spring and summer, we’re likely to see extra broods of species showing strongly this autumn – speckled woods, small coppers, wall browns and even white admirals may emerge. Although it is some months before official data can confirm this, it appears to have been an excellent summer for most of our 59 native species. Even those in steep decline, such as the wall brown, have been seen in abundance. But the late broods aren’t all good news: for many species, they are a “development trap” because the caterpillars produced by these butterflies cannot find suitable food plants or reach the stage they require to survive the winter. "
"The much-persecuted hen harrier has enjoyed its best breeding year in England for nearly two decades, benefiting from good weather and high numbers of voles. Grouse moor groups hailed the fledging of 60 chicks from 19 nests across the northern Pennines as a vindication of controversial “brood management”, whereby chicks are removed from some nests on grouse moors, reared in captivity and released elsewhere. Brood management is one part of a government action plan for the endangered hen harrier, but most conservation charities have disavowed it, arguing that the shooting industry must first stop the illegal killing of hen harriers. Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog, thanked partners including landowners, police and charities, and said: “Despite the great progress there is no cause for complacency. Too many birds still go missing in unexplained circumstances and I urge anyone who is still engaged in the persecution of these magnificent creatures to cease at once.” Although ecologists calculate that the English uplands could support a breeding population of 330 pairs of hen harriers, the birds virtually ceased breeding in England earlier this century because of persecution. Hen harriers are targeted because they predate red grouse, for which there is a lucrative driven shooting industry on the moors. This year’s success – the best since Natural England began working to revive the species in 2002 – means that 141 hen harrier chicks have fledged over the past three years. Amanda Anderson, the director of the Moorland Association, said: “Yet again it has been a fantastic year for hen harriers and we have now seen significant increases in successful nests and chick numbers for three years running as part of the hen harrier recovery plan, which includes the innovative brood management scheme trial. “Twelve of the nests reported today are on land managed for grouse shooting and this reflects a genuine commitment from moor owners and managers to work with others and help rebuild the harrier population.” Dr Ruth Tingay, a co-director of Wild Justice said: “It doesn’t matter how many successful hen harrier nests there were this year if those young birds are subsequently shot, trapped and poisoned on driven grouse moors. This is a species in desperate trouble, its population in continuing decline, and Natural England would do well to put its resources into targeting the criminals within the grouse shooting industry instead of issuing joint press releases proclaiming ‘success’.”"
"It has been described as the “holy grail” of marine biology, an act that is crucial to the survival of apex predators but has never been documented in detail: the mating of great white sharks. Despite decades of research into the habits of the white pointer, how and where the marine creatures mate has largely remained a mystery. Until now. The testimony of a fisherman working in the frigid waters of the Otago Peninsula on the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island has  shed light on great white sex in astonishing detail. Dick Ledgerwood’s account is only the second of its kind in the world. It took 23 years, a cup of tea and the help of marine biologist Steve Crawford for it to surface. “Witnessing white pointer copulation is informally referred to among scholars as the ‘holy grail’ of white shark ecology,” Crawford, a marine biologist from the University of Guelph in Canada, told the Guardian. “Four-plus tonnes of combined apex predator flesh is an extraordinarily delicate dance.” Crawford first got wind of Ledgerwood’s tale from wharfies at Port Chalmers while he was in New Zealand studying shark behaviour in 2016. He tracked Ledgerwood down, interviewed him at his home in Dunedin, and went out on the water with him. Ledgerwood’s story, published for the first time by the Guardian, is the fullest account recorded of the mysterious white pointer mating rituals. Ledgerwood is now 86, but in 1997, he was fishing each day on the Otago harbour. He started, aged 15, and headed out to sea for 43 years, mostly hunting crayfish and sole. He would spend days at sea, fishing “until the freezer was full up”, before heading back to Port Chalmers where the catch would be processed. In his decades on the water, he estimates he saw 12 or 14 white pointers up close. Most of the sightings were at Taiaroa Head, where the sharks would feed on offal discarded from a fish-processing factory nearby. “On a really calm day, they were just cruising around – and they made you hang on when you were walking around the boat,” Ledgerwood said. “Sometimes they’d circle around come and have a look at you, and then just go away.” It was an early November day in 1997 when Ledgerwood took the Shirley B out on the harbour, setting off from Dunedin and heading east towards Port Chalmers to fuel the boat up. At Sawyers Bay, 11km up the harbour, Ledgerwood’s mate, Roy, called out. “‘Oh, Dick. There’s something white in the water back there’,” Ledgerwood recalled. The duo turned the wooden boat towards the frothing commotion in unusually shallow water near a sandbank. Ledgerwood: “It was two sharks wedged close together, and they were just revolving round and round, very, very slowly”. The pair of fisherman, both having spent decades at sea, “had never seen anything like it”. They stopped the boat and stared at two, four-metre sharks “locked together” in just four metres of water. Despite a 30-metre boat approaching, the sharks were “completely preoccupied”, Ledgerwood says, and the Shirley B drifted to within 10 metres of them. “They just carried on with what they were doing,” Ledgerwood says. “They were … locked together, and just revolving in slow circles,” Ledgerwood says, who estimates a full rotation of the sharks took about ten seconds, a movement he described as a “slow revolution”. Their taut grey bodies were pushed closely together, belly to belly, Ledgerwood remembers, “revolving” the entire time: “They were clenched on”. “[They stayed] in one spot. Rolling and rolling and rolling,” “We just drifted up, and they didn’t worry. I mean you wouldn’t, would you?” laughs Ledgerwood. “Well, I wouldn’t.” Ledgerwood said none of the Dunedin old-timers had ever heard of, or witnessed such an event, and many could make no sense of what the ageing fisherman had seen. “I honestly think some people thought we were seeing things, but we definitely weren’t, because we turned back to go and watch, to see what it was.” The New Zealand Department of Conservation’s shark expert Clinton Duffy, calls Ledgerwood’s testimony “interesting and valuable”. However, his team has yet to verify it and says they would need images or video to do that. “I have seen hundreds of great whites and I have certainly never seen anything like mating behaviour between them,” Duffy says. “It’s hard to witness [copulation] for any species of shark. Globally, most of the observations are from aquaria. Great whites are large, highly mobile, and rare, and it really diminishes the chance you’ll be able to observe that in the wild.” Duffy says it is likely great whites choose quiet, out-of-the-way places to mate, away from aggregation sites like seal colonies, which female sharks tend to avoid because there are too many males. “It’s really, really hard to observe,” Duffy says, adding that basking and whale shark mating has also never been seen in the wild, among many other marine animals. “It’s a bit fraught [pointer mating], and it’s dangerous for both sexes. Other sharks can attack the mating couple, or other males can try to mate with the same female,” Duffy says. “The marine environment is still pretty opaque to us.” During copulation, male sharks use claspers to internally fertilise the female, Crawford says. “Clamping down with their razor-sharp teeth in courtship nips on the female’s side. Evolution has kindly provided females with much thicker skin, very likely for this kind of protection, and then navigate through the dance to actually complete the act.” And it is this “dance” that Ledgerwood witnessed in the waters off Sawyers Bay. “There is only one other incidental, distance observation potentially describing this mating phenomenon in all of the scientific literature,” says Crawford. “Going to completion with the kind of ultra-focused copulation spinning that Dick saw – that would be on the very rare side of things.” The first person to report having witnessed great white sex was a Department of Conservation seal observer, also in New Zealand, who saw the phenomenon in Nugget Point, Southland, in 1991. He wrote a brief account of it for the department: “I have unwittingly been fortunate to witness a mating [between two white sharks]. I had thought at the beginning they were fighting as one animal appeared to be attempting to grasp the other with its great mouth, making great gouges in its side. However, they had eventually become motionless, one under the other, turning over from time to time belly to belly. This obvious copulation lasted some forty minutes before the animals finally parted and glided off in opposite directions.” He did not agree to be interviewed by Crawford and his sighting has not been verified by the Department of Conservation. Crawford says Ledgerwood’s account is “vital” to scientists’ understanding of the elusive white pointer, which remain hunted and feared in spite of their protected status. From an ecological perspective, scientists cannot pretend to have a reasonable understanding of any species’ biology if they have never observed mating, Crawford says. “Previous hypotheses have been put forward suggesting that we never see white pointers mating because they go off on some mid-ocean, deep-water migrations that would be difficult if not impossible to follow and observe,” says Crawford. “If it turns out that white pointers actually prefer relatively shallow substrates to copulate on, this would have an enormous effect on our ability to protect these preferred mating habitats, especially during the mating season, from human interference.” Duffy says while the numbers of Australian and New Zealand white pointers remain stable at around 750 animals, some continue to die in the nets of fishing boats, or tangled in shark lines that protect beaches. Globally, their numbers are dwindling, and they are classified as a “vulnerable” species. For Ledgerwood, the experience is one he will never forget. “They were still, y’know, active when we left,” he says."
"Earlier this year, more than 350 elephants mysteriously died in the Okavango delta in Botswana. Individuals of all ages and both sexes were affected, with many walking in circles before dying suddenly, collapsing on their faces. The mass die-off in May and June was described as a “conservation disaster”. Three months later, most surviving elephants have fled. Last week a plane flew over the Okavango Panhandle, an area in the north-west of the delta where most of the deaths occurred, and eight elephants were spotted, when normally you would see hundreds, says Dr Niall McCann, director of conservation at UK-based charity National Park Rescue. “It is understandable, I’m sure you or I would flee if all our friends and relatives were dying, and that’s what the elephants appear to have done.”  Elephants are now reported to have started dying in a similar way in neighbouring Zimbabwe. At the time of writing, 22 have died, with numbers expected to rise. Dr Roy Bengis, retired chief state veterinarian of the Kruger national park, says testing fresh carcasses in Zimbabwe could be an opportunity to understand what happened in Botswana, although it is not clear if there is a link between the two incidents. “Nowhere do we have anything definitive at this stage. Not that I want another elephant to die but it would be so great to be able to get a very fresh carcass,” he says. There have been many competing theories about the cause of the deaths in Botswana. Human-elephant conflicts are common in the Okavango delta, an agricultural area home to 15,000 elephants and 16,000 people, but poisoning or poaching are unlikely to be to blame. Cyanide was ruled out because no scavengers died and tusks were left intact, according to a commentary piece co-authored by Bengis in the African Journal of Wildlife Research. Pesticides and anthrax were tested for and also ruled out. Researchers have been unable to visit the site in Botswana and most samples were collected from animals that had already started rotting. Samples need to be stored under very specific conditions and quickly transported to international labs with specific equipment to be tested – this was not done, resulting in widespread speculation about possible causes. After months of work, scientists have whittled the cause down to two leading theories – neurotoxins in algal blooms or a rodent virus known as EMC (encephalomyocarditis). Local sources estimate that 70% of elephants in Okavango in Botswana died near waterholes, many of which contained blue-green algal blooms. Toxins from algae were initially ruled out as a potential cause because elephants were the only species to die (with the exception of one horse). Now experts think elephants could be more vulnerable to algal bloom toxins because they spend so much time bathing and frolicking in water. Their long trunks also have a large number of olfactory receptors and they can drink hundreds of litres of water a day, potentially exposing them to more toxins than other species. Prof Christine Gosden from the University of Liverpool, who has previously studied the toxicology of chemical warfare, says she felt a responsibility to look into the mysterious deaths after reading the story in the Guardian. Her findings suggest they could be caused by a recently discovered bacterial toxin produced by algae called BMAA (beta-methylamino-L-alanine). She made the link after reading about the similarities between the behaviour of disoriented whales and dolphins that became beached and died (and tested positive for BMAA in their brain), and reports of elephants walking around in circles before collapsing. “They’re large mammals and they’re showing the same sort of behaviour – they’re clearly lost and disoriented,” she says, describing this connection as a “giant clue”. BMAA has also been found in the brain tissue of people with dementia. BMAA is mainly found in marine environments (as opposed to fresh water) and many researchers question whether it is found in high enough concentrations to kill an elephant. It could be part of a cocktail of toxins, says Dr James Metcalf, a senior researcher at Brain Chemistry Labs, a non-profit research institute in Jackson, Wyoming, who has looked at cyanobacteria in Africa. “I would not be surprised to find BMAA in the brains of elephants. It may be a contributing factor, but without the testing it’s really hard to say.” Zebra, wildebeest, white rhinoceros and impala have all died from ingesting toxic algae but there is no literature about elephants dying from neurotoxins in algal blooms. This might be because pathologists and vets do not initially test for cyanobacteria, and once they decide to do so it is often too late because the tissues have deteriorated or the algal blooms have gone. Rising temperatures and intensive farming methods are fuelling an increase in algal blooms in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and seas around the world. Elephants are naive to this potential threat which makes them vulnerable. “There’s lots of interesting evidence slowly building to suggest that environmental exposure to neurotoxins is having more of an impact on species than we realised. And goodness knows what’s happening with people,” says McCann. The fact that the elephant carcasses were close to water holes does not mean water was the source of the poison – frequently sick animals seek out water because they are feverish or thirsty. Farming is widespread on the floodplains of the Okavango delta and this year has seen a bumper crop of maize and sorghum because of late rains in 2020 following a string of dry years. This could have attracted families of elephants to cropland as well an increase in rodents, which defecate and urinate on tufts of grass. This means they would have been in close contact. Most grazers eat the leaf part of grass, but elephants grab grass with their trunk and eat the whole tuft (including rodent faeces), potentially exposing them to the EMC virus. Unlike neurotoxins, EMC is a fairly well-known pathogen that most frequently affects elephants in zoos where there are lots of rats – there have been several cases in US zoos and one in Australia. It caused the death of 64 elephants in Kruger national park between 1993 and 1994. “[In Botswana] there were anecdotal stories that these elephants just dropped stone dead in their tracks – and that fits with EMC. That’s one of the characteristics that we saw in Kruger,” says Bengis. Like neurotoxins that can kill in as little as 20 minutes, EMC is a quick death that causes elephants to collapse on their feet (although it can incubate for for five to 10 days, so elephants can move long distances in that time). The single dead horse could be a clue – not a coincidence – as horses are also vulnerable to EMC. Normally there is a sex bias in deaths from EMC – 83% of elephants that died in Kruger national park were adult males – but this was not the case with the Okavango deaths. “The timing of the mortalities is also of relevance as extensive studies in the Seronga area [in Okavango] have identified the months of February to May as peak crop-raiding months,” researchers wrote in the commentary paper. “Crop raiding is not only carried out by males, but by family units predominantly comprising females and young elephants, which would explain the lack of sex and age bias.” The Botswana government has ruled out EMC because there was no damage or abnormalities found on heart tissue of the animals, but it is not clear how many samples were tested. Authorities have been contacted for comment. Scientists are keen to solve the mystery to help mitigate future deaths in more isolated, less resilient elephant populations which may be unable to withstand the loss of so many individuals. Without proper testing, researchers cannot be certain this is not the start of an epidemic. Awareness about the risk of emerging pathogens and the importance of testing disease outbreaks in wildlife is greater than ever. McCann says: “If this is a toxicity situation then there’s the possibility of it spilling into the human population.” Authorities are being urged to test fresh samples from Zimbabwe as well as rodent faeces and algal blooms in the Okavango delta.

"Infants exposed to even low levels of air pollution experience reduced lung function as children and teenagers, researchers have found. Their study found that exposure to air pollution in the first year of life reduced lung function development from the ages of six to 15, even at pollution levels below EU standards. “This is worrying because it suggests that damage to lungs in the first year of life can affect respiratory health throughout life,” said Dr Qi Zhao of the IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine in Düsseldorf, whose work was presented at the international congress of the European Respiratory Society. The study included 915 children living in the Munich and Wesel regions of Germany. The children had tests to measure theeir breathing power at the ages of six, 10 and 15. The researchers compared the results with estimated levels of pollution in the areas the children had lived until they were one year old. After controlling for factors including parental smoking, the researchers found that the higher the level of pollution exposure as babies, the worse their lung function was as adolescents. The impact was even greater on children who developed asthma. A second study, also presented at the congress, found that adults who were exposed to air pollution, even at low levels, were more likely to develop asthma. In a study of 23,000 Danish nurses, the researchers found a 29% rise in asthma risk for each increase of 6.3 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) in small particulate matter known as PM2.5. They also found a 16% rise in asthma risk for each 8.2 µg/m3 increase of nitrogen dioxide. The WHO limit for PM2.5 is an annual average of 10 µg/m3, and the EU limit is 25. Both the WHO and EU limits for nitrogen dioxide are 40 µg/m3. Shuo Liu, a visiting PhD fellow at the University of Copenhagen, told the conference: “The fact that we found a link with asthma, even at relatively low levels of exposure, suggests that there is no safe threshold for air pollution. This is strong evidence that our regulations on air pollution need to be stricter if we want to prevent cases of asthma.” Thierry Troosters, president of the European Respiratory Society, said: “These studies are concerning because they suggest that current regulations, such as the EU limit values for air pollution, are not safe enough. Previous research has shown that up to 67,000 cases of childhood asthma could be avoided every year in Europe if countries would meet the World Health Organization air quality limit values, which are lower than the EU’s current standards.” Campaigners in the UK have called on the government to replace the existing EU air quality directive with more stringent legal limits. Zak Bond, a policy officer at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: “We are campaigning for the government to commit to a legal limit for PM2.5 in the environment bill in line with WHO guidelines. It’s time to reduce air pollution so everyone can breathe clean air with healthy lungs.” Chris Large, the joint-CEO at the environmental charity Global Action Plan said: “This research makes it ever clearer that even low levels can have a horrendous impact throughout people’s lives.” “We’d like the government to adopt WHO standards as a bare minimum and reallocate the £27bn set aside for a new road-building programme towards initiatives such as improving broadband quality that reduce the need for road travel.” The clean air campaigner Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said: “People are wrong to think everything is OK as long as pollution levels are within legal limits. There’s no such thing as a safe level.” Jemima Hartshorn, the founder of Mums for Lungs, called on the government to “stop dragging its feet and implement binding and enforceable WHO levels in law”. “We cannot compromise on the nation’s health,” she said."
"The Morrison government has proposed lifting a ban on the importation of exotic parrot species into Australia, with experts concerned it could lead to the introduction of diseases and feral pests and an increase in illegal wildlife trade. It has been illegal to import live psittacine birds into Australia since 1995 when a ban was introduced due to concerns about disease. But the government is now considering a change to the rules in response to calls from pet owners, hobbyists and zoos to develop a safe importation pathway for captive parrots. Currently, the only parrots that can be imported are pets from New Zealand whose owners are relocating to Australia permanently. The federal agriculture department has begun public consultation on a risk assessment that considers the potential biosecurity threats of opening Australia’s borders to captive parrots from overseas. Luis Ortiz-Catedral, a conservation biologist at Massey University in New Zealand, has spent years assessing risks to parrot populations. He said he believed it was important to develop a safe pathway for parrots that were companion animals, but the government assessment was missing important detail on what authorities would do to ensure Australia’s wild native parrot populations were not exposed to disease. “There is an intrinsic connection between global trade of these kinds of birds and the spread of novel diseases and pathogens,” Ortiz-Catedral said. “Before going ahead, I think they need to consider the scale of the cost if there were a spillover into wild populations or to facilities in Australia that have captive populations or zoo collections. “I’m not saying it shouldn’t happen, I’m just pointing out the risks that are not properly addressed in the document,” he said. Johanne Martens, an ecologist at Deakin University, said she was concerned control measures weren’t listed for some common parrot diseases, such as beak and feather disease. She said there were several other risks, including that introduced captive parrots could escape and become feral populations that threaten native species and that opening legal imports would also facilitate the illicit trade of animals. “I don’t really see any arguments in favour. I can see why some zoos and wildlife parks might want to get more exotic species but I don’t really see why it’s necessary. We have such an incredible variety of birds here already,” Martens said. Public comment on the draft is open until 19 September. If the feedback is favourable, import conditions will be developed and prospective importers – such as zoos, aviculturists and pet owners – will be able to apply for a permit. A department spokesperson said the rule changes were being considered now because advances in science and testing meant concerns about disease could be managed. Countries with a compliant history of avian trade with Australia – Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States – would be approved for export of captive parrots without the need for further assessment. Other countries that want to export animals would need to apply and be assessed. The spokesperson said only animals that are on a list of species considered suitable for import under Australia’s national environmental laws – such as the blue and yellow macaw – could be imported. The spokesperson said specific control measures had not been considered for beak and feather disease virus because it was endemic to Australia “and not subject to official notification or control”. Applications to import birds would require “evidence that the specimen has been legally sourced”. The federal MP Warren Entsch is a bird lover who has pushed for a safe pathway for parrot imports with record-keeping and health checks. In 2018, he spoke out in a Guardian Australia investigation that revealed the environment department granted permits for the export of hundreds of native Australian birds to the German organisation the Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, despite concerns the animals would be sold at a huge profit. He believes the current prohibition on all imports encourages illegal trade. “If anybody has any understanding of wildlife trade, they would understand that the best way to promote illegal trade is prohibition,” he said. But George Olah, a conservation geneticist at Australian National University’s Fenner School, said introducing Australia as a new importer of parrots could boost both legal and illegal forms of trade. “I have worked with the police on some illegal parrot trade cases,” he said. “Breeders often buy poached parrots and make them ‘legal’ by reporting them as [having] hatched in their facilities and giving them CITES (convention on international trade in endangered species) certificates.” Olah said Australia had learnt from past mistakes when it came to biosecurity regulations and the current policy had been put in place after a lot of consideration. He said trade in parrots, as well as other human activities such as habitat destruction, had contributed to their decline in the wild. “I know that many people don’t share this opinion … but as a wildlife researcher, I think people should just not keep any parrots or exotic animals as pets.”"
"An unusual series of strandings and sightings of 29 rare beaked whales has taken place around the shores of northern Europe. Experts have suggested the strandings may be linked to a military sonar exercise. The events, whose rarity indicates that they might be linked by a single cause, began two weeks ago with the sighting of two northern bottlenose whales in the North Sea. They are the same species of beaked whale as the Thames whale of 2006. This was followed by seven bottlenoses that stranded, alive, on the west coast of Ireland, the largest stranding of the species recorded in Ireland. Six of the animals died, and one returned to the open sea. A further 11 animals stranded on the Faroe Islands in the past week – reports indicate that five of the whales were killed for their meat. On Friday two bottlenose whales were seen in Oosterschelde estuary in the south of the Netherlands, and on Saturday, at least three beaked whales were seen in the Firth of Clyde, close to Greenock. Over the past 10 days, three Sowerby’s beaked whales have also stranded and died: in the Netherlands, Wenduine in Belgium, and in Lowestoft, where an individual male, believed to be one of a pair seen off the Norfolk coast, was found dead. On Sunday a female Sowerby’s stranded close to Portsmouth in Hampshire, and died soon after. Rob Deaville and Matt Perkins, from the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme of the Zoological Society of London, who are responsible for examining strandings, told the Guardian that the preliminary examination of the Lowestoft animal did not reveal any obvious signs of decompression sickness, but they would be conducting further investigations on this and the whale found near Portsmouth to determine their cause of death. These deep-diving marine mammals can only feed at oceanic depths. Their appearance in shallow coastal waters is rare and often fatal – as in the case of the Thames whale, which died from dehydration after being unable to feed. A diet of squid and fish is the source of fresh water for cetaceans. There are many theories as to why such strandings occur. Storms appear to be a factor, and recent bad weather may have played a part in these events. It seems clear that something causes the whales to enter shallow water. It may be that their navigational sense – still not fully understood – becomes disrupted. A mass stranding of 30 sperm whales on North Sea coasts in 2016 has been linked to unusual solar storms that year which may have interfered with the animals’ sense of direction. But a series of scientific papers have indicated that the use of military sonar and seismic surveys for oil may be to blame. In February this year, an Australian paper found a “strong association” between military exercises using “anti-submarine” mid-frequency active sonar and the deaths of beaked whales. It is thought the sonar may scare the animals into surfacing too quickly, causing decompression sickness – a condition also suffered by human divers when they rise too fast. Earlier this summer a major Nato anti-submarine exercise named Dynamic Mongoose was carried out off Iceland. Although it ended on 10 July, conservationists are concerned that its after-effects may now be being detected in the strandings of the past two weeks. The Dutch whale researcher Jeroen Hoekendijk, who has been monitoring the strandings in the Netherlands, wrote in a blogpost: “It is very likely that the strandings that are reported right now are a direct consequence of the usage of [military] sonar. If so, the beaked whales that we are seeing washed up on our shores could be just the tip of the iceberg.” Beaked whales are perhaps the most mysterious marine mammals. Some species have only been seen alive on a handful of occasions. They are the deepest-diving of all cetaceans – Cuvier’s beaked whales can reach depths of up to 3,000 metres and stay down for two hours hunting their favoured food source, squid. They consume these by sucking the cephalopods; only male beaked whales have teeth: a single pair set at the front of their jaws, which are used in mating challenges, as witnessed by the extensive scarring seen on some beaked whales. These teeth or tusks can arch over the whale’s mouth, sometimes to the extent that they become a muzzle, preventing the animals from completely opening their jaws. Most species of beaked whales are recorded as “data deficient” and their conservation status as “vulnerable”."
"The track north-west of Abney is an old one, a packhorse route linking the village of Bradwell with Ashford and points south. Here it reaches its high point before dropping steeply into Bradwell, an exposed spot, often harsh on a winter’s day and sometimes on a summer’s one as well. I found myself leaning into a strong breeze pushing across the moor, shaking the hairgrass and ruffling the yarrow and selfheal growing prettily against a long drystone wall that bordered the trail and offered me some shelter. Abney Moor is a fine vantage point to consider the endless miles of these “Derbyshire hedges” and how varied they are, in function and form: how in one direction they can seem pleasing and complementary to the landscape, following the rise and fall of steep pasture, like a cast net, and yet in another appear angular and stern, laid ruler-straight with no feel for the ebb and flow of the hillside. Built into the footing of the one next to me were remnants of a medieval cross that once marked the boundary of three parishes, shown on the map as Robin Hood’s Cross, although originally named for a local baron and not the outlaw. Rather than follow the track down to Bradwell, I cut left here along Bleak Knoll, its crest split down the middle for more than half a mile by an unusually high wall, over six feet in places. And along its length every 15 feet or so, roughly a rod in old measures, a small rectangular aperture had been built into its base a few inches off the ground. It must have been the devil to work in so many of these things, and the obvious question was why. Holes in drystone walls have a plethora of names that sometimes explain their purpose: “lunky” is common in some parts of the country, “hogg hole” in others, a hogget being a yearling sheep. But these gaps seemed too narrow for all but the youngest lambs to squeeze through. Wallers might also build in a “smuse” or “smoot” hole for rabbits, to trap them as they passed through or stop them burrowing underneath and weakening the structure. This seemed more likely; 100 years ago, a rabbit farm nearby was supplying a London furrier."
"Polluted air in the UK causes 3m working days to be lost every year owing to people getting sick or taking time off to care for sick children, new research suggests. Cutting air pollution and meeting the World Health Organization standards would benefit the economy by about £1.6bn a year, by improving productivity, according to the analysis carried out by the CBI. About 17,000 premature deaths of working age people each year would be prevented by meeting the guidelines. Workers would also see more pay, with about £900m a year in extra wages from the increased time at work. The £1.6bn economic uplift does not include the reduced costs to the NHS and social care budgets, estimated at £157m a year, which would also result from lower sickness rates. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist of the CBI, said employers and the government should aim for a “green recovery” from the coronavirus crisis, by investing in public transport and energy efficiency. “Not only is there a clear moral responsibility to address air pollution and the impact it has on human health and the environment, there’s also a striking economic rationale,” she said. “With air pollution hitting the balance sheets of businesses across the country, and cutting the earnings of their employees, cleaning up our air would help us to lead healthier and more productive lives, while delivering a green jobs boost for the economy.” The government has been pushing people to get back into the office, following the sharp rise in people working from home during the coronavirus lockdowns, with warnings of job losses if they fail to return. Ministers are motivated by concern over the loss of business to companies, from public transport providers to sandwich shops, that rely on people in offices. Jane Burston, executive director of the Clean Air Fund, which commissioned the report from CBI Economics, said this call could be counterproductive unless the government and local authorities made it easier for people to use cleaner modes of transport. Data compiled by the group found a 25% reduction in NO2 emissions in London during the morning rush hour and a 34% fall at evening commuting times, during the lockdown. “Encouraging people into their cars will increase pollution,” Burston warned. “The government needs to consider that building back the economy is not just about going back to the physical office. The consequences for air pollution are consequences for the economy, and the economic benefits [of reducing air pollution] are significant.” The report found that work absences alone related to poor air were costing Britain about £600m a year, owing to people missing work from poor health but also from taking time off to look after children, who are among the worst affected by air pollution. Jacob West, director of healthcare innovation at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Adopting ambitious World Health Organization guidelines could not only add years to our life, but also benefit the country’s finances. These encouraging figures should give the government confidence to embrace tougher air pollution limits in the environment bill.” The government’s environment bill has been delayed, but is set to return to parliament this autumn. However, as currently written it will not contain new targets on air pollution. Any binding new targets, to take over from the EU’s regulations, will not be set out until late 2022, after a consultation. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The World Health Organization has praised our clean air strategy as an example for the rest of the world to follow, and we continue to take robust and comprehensive action to tackle emissions in the UK. But we know there is more to do, which is why through our landmark environment bill we have committed to setting ambitious targets to improve air quality in the long term, and address the concentration of damaging fine particulate matter.”"
"Environment minister Sussan Ley has moved to revoke the export of shark fins and other seafood products from a Queensland government fishery over inaction on reforms to protect threatened species. Ley has written to Queensland’s fisheries minister, Mark Furner, saying the state had not met the conditions of its export licence for the East Coast Inshore Fin Fish Fishery, which would be revoked from 30 September. Conservationists and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority have voiced concerns that threatened species including turtles, dolphins and dugongs are at risk of being killed in nets in the fishery. The fishery targets species including barramundi, flathead and whiting for sale domestically and operates both in and out of the Great Barrier Reef. But under an export licence granted by the federal environment minister, fishers also export products – mainly shark fins, mullet roe and the valuable swim bladders of black jewfish used in traditional Chinese medicine. One conservationist told Guardian Australia that revocation of an export licence – known as a Wildlife Trade Operation – was extremely rare. In the letter, Ley wrote: “It is deeply disappointing that the reforms underpinning these conditions have stalled and momentum has been lost in progress towards the sustainable management of this fishery.” Domestic trade from the fishery is exempt from the minister’s intervention, but the letter said the decision “will impact on those fishing businesses that export product from the [fishery]”. “I expect this will exacerbate the already difficult operating environment for those fishers who are affected. Therefore I suggest the Queensland government will need to consider how it could ameliorate those impacts,” Ley wrote. Separately, the environment minister told Guardian Australia that exports must comply with sustainability requirements. “If we are going to have sharks killed for fins or black jewfish targeted for their swim bladders to make cosmetics or as an aphrodisiac used in Chinese medicine, at the very least it needs to done in a way that complies with the sustainability requirements that the Queensland government itself negotiated and agreed to, as a condition of its WTO approval,” Ley said. As Guardian Australia reported last week, conservationists and some recreational fishing groups claim the reforms across all Queensland’s fisheries have stalled. Some recreational fishers have walked away from reform working groups in frustration at a lack of progress. Guardian Australia also reported the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority had highlighted how the use of large mesh nets in the fishery was a high risk to threatened species “due to potential entanglements and death”. Pressure from under-regulated fishing risked compromising the reef, which was already facing “unprecedented pressure”, the authority said. Global heating has driven three mass coral bleaching events in the past five years across the world’s biggest reef system. The marine park authority said it also had concerns for the future sustainability of black jewfish – prized for their swim bladders. The export licence was granted in December 2018 with conditions and timeframes, including four that Ley said had not been implemented in time. Those included having in place an independent data collection and validation program, rules to better monitor shark catch, a plan to prevent ecological impacts and harvest strategies that also included impacts on protected species. In the letter, Ley said actions needed to have been in place by January 2020 – well before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. She urged Queensland to “demonstrate compliance” as soon as possible so that exports could restart. Lawyers representing the conservation group Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) wrote to the minister in February asking her to investigate compliance issues. Ley said AMCS and WWF-Australia had both raised concerns about the fisheries export licence. Tooni Mahto, a fisheries and threatened species campaigner at AMCS, said it was “incredibly rare” for a minister to revoke an export licence. “This is strong action from the minister, but it is a fair reflection of the Queensland government’s failure to do what it committed to in 2018, and also to do what’s expected by recreational fishers, conservationists and the Queensland community. “The reforms should have delivered protection for reef wildlife – our turtles, dolphins and dugongs are drowning in these nets in the reef and at the moment there’s poor control in limiting the number of wildlife deaths.” In a statement, Queensland fisheries minister Mark Furner acknowledged receipt of Ley’s letter and was “considering our response”. He said the government was committed to its sustainable fisheries reforms and significant steps had been taken to ensure a sustainable commercial and recreational fishing industry “for generations to come”."
"The partial skull of an armoured fish that swam in the oceans over 400m years ago could turn the evolutionary history of sharks on its head, researchers have said. Bony fish, such as salmon and tuna, as well as almost all terrestrial vertebrates, from birds to humans, have skeletons that end up made of bone. However, the skeletons of sharks are made from a softer material called cartilage – even in adults. Researchers have long explained the difference by suggesting that the last common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates had an internal skeleton of cartilage, with bony skeletons emerging after sharks had already evolved. The development was thought so important that living vertebrates are divided into “bony vertebrates” and “cartilaginous vertebrates” as a result. Among other evidence for the theory, the remains of early fish called placoderms – creatures with bony armour plates that also formed part of the jaws – shows they had internal skeletons made of cartilage.  But a startling new discovery has upended the theory: researchers have found the partial skull-roof and brain case of a placoderm composed of bone. The fossil, about 410m years old and reported in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, was unearthed in western Mongolia in 2012, and belongs to a placoderm that has been dubbed Minjinia turgenensis and would have been about 20-40cm in length.  “This fossil is probably the most surprising thing I have ever worked on in my career. I never expected to find this,” Dr Martin Brazeau of Imperial College London, first author of the research, said. “We know a lot about [placoderm] anatomy and we have hundreds of different species of these things – and none of them has ever shown this kind of bone.”  The new discovery, he said, casts doubt on the idea that sharks branched off the evolutionary tree of jawed vertebrates before a bony internal skeleton evolved. “This kind of flips it on its head, because we never expected really for there to be a bony internal skeleton this far down in the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates,” said Brazeu. “This is the type of thing [that suggests] maybe we need to rethink a lot about how all of these different groups evolved.” While the team say that one possibility is that bony skeletons could have evolved twice – once giving rise to the newly discovered placoderm species and once to the ancestor of all living bony vertebrates – a more likely possibility is that an ancestor of sharks and bony vertebrates actually had a bony skeleton, but that at some point in their evolutionary history the ability to make bone was lost in sharks. Brazeau said the new findings add weight to the idea that the last common ancestor of all modern jawed vertebrates did not resemble “some kind of weirdo shark”, as is often depicted in text books. Instead, he said, such an ancestor more likely resembled a placoderm or primitive bony fish. Dr Daniel Field, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the work, welcomed the findings. “Evolutionary biologists were long guided by the assumption that the simplest explanation – the one that minimised the number of inferred evolutionary changes – was most likely to be correct. With more information from the fossil record, we are frequently discovering that evolutionary change has proceeded in more complex directions than we had previously assumed,” he said. “The new work by Brazeau and colleagues suggests that the evolution of the cartilaginous skeleton of sharks and their relatives surprisingly arose from a bony ancestor – adding an extra evolutionary step and illustrating that earlier hypotheses were overly simplistic.” "
"Toxic pesticides banned for use in the UK are being exported to countries with less stringent regulations, under loopholes in international trade rules. Two companies, Syngenta and Ineos, are exporting from UK facilities large quantities of pesticides based on chemicals that would be illegal for use in the EU, according to documents obtained by Greenpeace UK’s Unearthed investigation and the Swiss NGO Public Eye, in freedom of information requests. Export notification data for 2018 showed Syngenta planned to ship more than 28,000 tonnes of pesticide containing paraquat, which was banned for use in the UK in 2007. Paraquat, which is fatal at small doses if ingested, can damage the lungs, eyes, kidneys and heart through long-term exposure. Inovyn, a subsidiary of the chemicals firm Ineos, made export notifications for 4,000 tonnes of the soil fumigant 1,3-dichloropropene, a suspected carcinogen banned in the EU because of the risks it poses to wildlife and groundwater. The UK was responsible for about 40% of the exports of these and similar products from the EU in 2018, the year to which the documents apply. While exporting these products is legal, despite the restrictions on their use in Europe, campaigners want the practice banned because of the likely harm to the importing countries. Baskut Tuncak, who from 2014 to 2020 was the UN’s special rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, said: “The UK must urgently end the export of paraquat and 1,3-dichloropropene. These pesticides are among the worst of the worst, unquestionably hazardous to human health.” In July, Tuncak and 35 experts from the Human Rights Council called for an end to such exports from rich nations to the developing world. France is enacting a ban, which will come into force from 2022, but other countries have been reluctant to place constraints on their industries. Some of the pesticides are destined for developing countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, India and Indonesia. Large amounts are also sold to rich nations: the US and Australia buy quantities of paraquat, according to the data, and Japan takes paraquat and 1,3-dichloropropene. “Just because a country is wealthy does not mean there are not grave human rights violations and abuses being committed against vulnerable communities,” said Tuncak. “In the US, where three times more pesticide products are registered for use, farmworkers suffer more chemical-related injuries and illnesses than any other workforce. The racial dimension can not be ignored, with so many agricultural and food workers from migrant and minority backgrounds.” Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said selling the pesticides was “exploitative hypocrisy” and urged ministers to end the practice. “The UK is at the heart of a European pesticide scandal that allows chemical giants to flood other countries – many of them poorer nations – with toxic chemicals on a major scale,” he said. “These pesticides are so dangerous that we’ve made the very sensible decision to ban their use in our own country and across Europe. What gives us the right to think it is morally defensible to continue producing and shipping them around the world?” Other European countries are also exporting thousands of tonnes of pesticides that would be disqualified for use in Europe. In terms of EU law, companies exporting certain substances must notify governments under a rule known as the prior informed consent regulation, overseen by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which provides a list of the exports. According to the agency’s latest report, from last December, the UK, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain together exported 9,016 tonnes of 1,3-dichloropropene, and the amount of paraquat and the herbicide trifluralin exported by the UK, Spain and Italy amounted to 15,983 tonnes. Greenpeace said its data differed from that published by the EU because it came from export notifications, so it was not certain that the exact amounts intended to be sent abroad were exported, while the ECHA data bundled together different chemicals for various purposes. A spokesperson for Ineos told the Guardian its 1,3-dichloropropene was exported under licence only to Japan, through the ECHA’s prior informed consent procedure, and that it was the most effective product against plant disease from nematodes (roundworms), helping to protect important food crops. “Japanese authorities approve the licensed import to ensure that they have all relevant details for the product relating to its safety, use and regulation,” the spokesperson said. “It is important to note that the product is still used within the EU in countries such as France, Spain and Italy where there is infestation of crops, under emergency procedures subject to national approvals. It is widely used in many other countries other than Japan and the EU.” A spokesperson for Syngenta said: “The crop protection industry is one of the most highly regulated in the world, with products subject to extensive evaluation before they are approved for registration and sale. To be exported and sold, any finished product needs to comply with the specific regulatory requirements of the importing countries. “The US is an example of one of these export locations. Paraquat has been subject to detailed scientific review and evaluation by the US Environmental Protection Agency over many years and it has been found to be safe and appropriate for use. We comply with the rule of law wherever we operate.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Decisions on the use of pesticides are based on careful scientific assessment of the risks, and this will not change after the [Brexit] transition period. We will continue to ensure our high human health and environmental standards are maintained as we implement our own independent pesticides regulatory regime. Chemicals currently banned will not become eligible for use in Great Britain.”"
"Across the sands of Traeth Bach, rearing above the Aber Iâ peninsula, Yr Wyddfa – the topmost peak of Snowdon – donned its habitual cloud cap. Arctic blasts of air wuthered across my evening perch on sea-wall rocks. A neap tide ran fiercely. Waders left off from feeding along its margins and scudded before the flood to roosts among the myriad of muddy inlets of Traeth Las. Oystercatchers, brilliant orange Pinocchio beaks and pied plumage catching the light, piped away upriver. The ice-polished crown of Ynys Gifftan reflected the sun dipping beneath the spreading cloudof an incoming front. I shivered, packed my rucksack, and turned for home. By the level crossing, I ducked into a thicket that made me think of Hardy’s “wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward” (The Voice), and plucked one of its heavy crop of purple fruits, biting through the skin’s bloom into bracingly bitter pale green flesh. I’ll go down there again soon with a bag and, rather than waiting for the first frost, will put the sloes in the freezer to make a winter favourite, sloe gin. But winter’s still months away. Now is the cusp of autumn, the air swarming with insects and the flutter-and-glide of house martins in pursuit of them. The swifts departed weeks ago, heading for Africa. I remember crawling through low caves in limestone cliffs at Mirleft on Morocco’s Atlantic coast with these strange members of the Apodidae – close relatives of the hummingbirds – shrieking through alongside. Next went the swallows, driven from Welsh coasts by gales before they’d even gathered on the wires. With their brilliant colours and graceful flight, these are the birds of summer I miss most. By now they’ll be streaming through the Pyrenean passes. Once, dropping down to the Ariège valley from the Pays de Sault, I saw them as a dark innumerable flow, at first below and then above, by Tarascon, where I was heading. Dr Johnson’s 1768 speculation – not founded on empirical observation – was that they “conglobulate” before plunging together, joined at claw and beak, beneath the surface of rivers to hibernate in mud at the bottom. It becomes almost plausible when they disappear as quickly and entirely as they did this year."
"Ministers and MPs from all parts of the political spectrum have condemned Extinction Rebellion for blocking the delivery of newspapers across the UK on Saturday. Four national newspapers, including the Sun and the Daily Mail, were missing from some newsagents’ shelves on Saturday morning after more than 100 environmental protesters targeted printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp on Friday evening. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: “A free press is vital in holding the government and other powerful institutions to account on issues critical for the future of our country, including the fight against climate change. It is completely unacceptable to seek to limit the public’s access to news in this way.” On Saturday morning, the Labour MP Dawn Butler tweeted “Bravo Extinction Rebellion”, but subsequently deleted it. The Labour party’s official line, which followed, read: “A free press is vital for our democracy. People have the right to read the newspapers they want. Stopping them from being distributed and printers from doing their jobs is wrong.” Protesters used trucks and bamboo scaffolds to block roads outside the Newsprinters works at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, and Knowsley, near Liverpool, on Friday night. The presses print the Sun, Times, Sun on Sunday and Sunday Times, as well as the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, and the London Evening Standard. Banners reading “Free The Truth” and “5 Crooks Control Our News” were hung on the site. By Saturday morning, police said about 72 activists had been arrested. A blockade in Glasgow was cleared at around midnight with no arrests. In a statement, Extinction Rebellion said the action was designed to disrupt and expose what it called a failure to adequately report on the climate emergency: “Our free press, society and democracy is under attack – from a failing government that lies to us consistently … Our leaders have allowed the majority of our media to be amassed in the hands of five people with powerful vested interests and deep connections to fossil fuel industries. We need a free press but we do not have it. They have failed us.” A former tabloid journalist, Steve Tooze, said he had joined the action at Broxbourne to support “one day with far less misinformation, division and hate”. Tooze, who said he had worked “for every one of these newspapers in the last 25 years”, had locked his arm into a concrete tube. “I feel that as a former insider, [these newspapers] hold a huge amount of blame for what we’re fed today by not telling the public what is really happening,” he said. “If it’s not in the newspapers, people don’t worry about it and, if people don’t worry about it, there’s no pressure on this government to treat this as the emergency it is.” But Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, said the action would be “laughable if it wasn’t so serious”. “Everyone has the right to peacefully protest and make their voices heard: after all, that is what a free press is all about,” he said. “But it is not acceptable for those who wish only their voices to be heard to attempt to silence others.” A spokesperson for Guardian News & Media, parent company of the Observer, said: “We fully support the right to protest – but we do not condone any action that restricts the public’s right to access journalism and buy whichever newspaper they choose.” While Extinction Rebellion has largely enjoyed the support of David Attenborough, in an article on Saturday he said it was not “sensible politics” for environmental protesters to break the law. Attenborough, Britain’s most celebrated naturalist, praised the younger generation for their passion but said: “I don’t think it is sensible politics to break the law. If you are any good at all, some of your demands will be met and then you will be demanding people abide by those new laws. You can’t have it both ways.” But his article, which highlighted the climate emergency, may not have been widely read – it was in one of the newspapers that Extinction Rebellion targeted, the Sun."
"Consumers are being exposed to an “avoidable risk” of disease after a reduction of official controls in food inspections of pig and poultry carcasses across the EU, European meat inspectors have said. Diseased meat is being eaten by consumers in the UK and EU, including pus from abscesses and tuberculosis lesions from pigs’ heads, said the European Working Community for Food Inspection and Consumer Protection (EFWFC) this week. The EWFC represents EU meat inspectors. In response to the claim, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the regulations for food safety had been developed to prevent meat that could be diseased or contaminated from reaching consumers. “If the FSA was aware of any breaches of these regulations it would be treated very seriously and we would take immediate action in response,” said a spokesperson. Ron Spellman, EWFC’s deputy secretary, said inspections should ensure that no carcass showing signs of disease entered the food chain, but that there had been an erosion of safety rules in the past decade. He highlighted changes in pig inspections by the European Commission in 2014, which moved from a thorough inspection to visual only. “Inspectors stopped cutting lymph nodes in pigs’ heads, which are known to contain abscesses and tuberculosis lesions. Under previous systems, the pigs’ head would have been rejected for food, but now the meat is minced to make sausages and meat pies, spreading the pus from the abscesses and TB material throughout these products. “I don’t think you can prove it’s safe to feed people abscesses, pus and TB material.” A spokesperson for the FSA said all pig heads were inspected visually. “If any of the lymph nodes is enlarged or abnormal, or there is any other reason to suspect that TB or any other infection might be present, then the nodes can also be incised to verify whether there are any lesions to confirm the suspicion. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) noted that routine incisions on all pigs heads without first relying on evidence or other reasons leads to cross-contamination between carcasses that is better avoided.” The EWFC is calling for food safety regulations at slaughterhouses to be “re-evaluated in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic”, and is also calling on the EU commission to reverse 2019 changes to poultry inspections that move away from 100% postmortem inspections, allowing for an official inspection of a “representative sample” if the abattoir has a history of food safety compliance and has a system to detect contamination and diseased meat. A spokesperson from the Food Standards Agency says: “Meat from healthy livestock prepared in accordance with good safety principles remains safe to eat. Although several animal species have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, these infections are not a driver of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The European commission based its decision to move away from postmortem inspections on scientific opinion that food-poisoning bacteria including campylobacter are not detected by visual meat inspection, and that carcasses visually contaminated by faeces are not more microbiologically contaminated than those not. The EWFC said these studies did not replicate EU slaughterhouse conditions and were flawed, pointing to a study that shows that carcasses contaminated with visible faecal spots carry significantly higher concentrations of harmful bugs than visibly clean carcasses and that postmortem checks to remove these are crucial. “There’s been a coordinated move away from meat inspections carried out by independent officials to a system where slaughterhouses get more control over that process, so they’re carrying out more of their own inspections,” said Spellman. “These changes are motivated not by science or a desire to protect the consumer but are politically motivated to give the meat industry what they want: the reductions and eventual removal of official independent meat inspection.” A spokesperson for the European commission said: “The European Union retains some of the highest food safety standards in the world – this is a key priority. This is why the European Food Safety Authority provides expert scientific advice and recommendations while national authorities are responsible to carry out inspections in accordance with the official controls legislation. “Any meat with lesions indicating an animal disease such as TB, or abscesses, or any pathological or organoleptic changes, must be considered as unfit for human consumption and not be placed on the market.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"It is a long time since images of a smoggy Beijing were in the news. India now leads the World Health Organization’s (WHO) league table of polluted cities. A new study shows that annual deaths from air pollution in China peaked in 2013 and are now below 1990 levels. Concerted action reduced particle pollution in 74 key Chinese cities by an average of 33% between 2013 and 2017. Industry and traffic were cleaned up and tackling fuels used at home played a big role too. In 2005, 61% of Chinese homes cooked using coal or wood. This reduced to 32% in 2017. Around Beijing coal heating was banned in favour of fossil (natural) gas, and clean energy was promoted countrywide. However, about 1.25 million Chinese people still die early each year as a result of air pollution. In 2005, the WHO set global guidelines for particle pollution and interim targets for countries to gauge progress. Today, the air breathed by 81% of China’s population has yet to meet the first interim target. Controlling air pollution is hard. Other countries can learn from China’s experience and avoid using fossil fuels, especially coal, to power their industrial development. "
"Australian conservation groups have written to the UN’s peak environmental heritage body urging it to oppose the Coalition’s bid to devolve the approval process for projects to state and territory governments. In a letter to the director general of Unesco, the 13 groups warn of the “alarming moves … to weaken legal protection for Australia’s 20 world heritage listed properties” through changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. In an interim report on the EPBC Act released in July, Graeme Samuels found the laws to protect unique species and habitats were ineffective. Despite the findings, the Morrison government has proposed legislation to allow bilateral agreements with the states and territories to give them control over planning approvals as a means to cut approval times and spur economic growth. The bill to streamline environmental approvals was rushed through the lower house on Thursday after debate was gagged, and despite concerns it does not contain promised environmental standards and could increase extinctions. The letter, signed by groups including the Australian Conservation Foundation, Environmental Justice Australia, the Wilderness Society and WWF Australia, warns that Australia’s natural world heritage sites are “under more pressure from industrialisation and climate change than ever before”. It listed threats to world heritage areas including: The groups warn against handing national development approval powers to state and territory governments “without any safeguards in place”. “This is of grave concern because state and territory governments are often the proponents of these threatening developments and activities or have policies that encourage and fast-track them.” The groups asked the director general, Audrey Azoulay, to write to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, to “express alarm” about the bill and “seek clarification on how the Australian government will meet its international responsibilities under the world heritage convention”. “The Australian government must not walk away from its responsibilities to protect and conserve world heritage.” Australia’s responsibilities under the convention are to identify, protect, conserve and transmit to future generations its world heritage sites. Labor has resolved to oppose the EPBC Act changes, the Greens have pushed to refer them to an inquiry, and independent MP Zali Steggall attempted to amend the bill to require state deals to conform with national environmental standards to be drawn up by the minister. ACF’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said Australia’s world heritage areas were home to “threatened wildlife like the koala, the cassowary and the grey-headed flying fox, but the plan to hand environmental powers to states and territories would make these species and their habitats more vulnerable than ever”. The Environmental Justice Australia co-chief executive, Nicola Rivers, said weakening protections would send a “shocking message that one of the wealthiest nations can’t manage to safeguard its 20 world heritage sites”. Suzanne Milthorpe, national laws campaign manager at the Wilderness Society, said: “It’s clear protections for Australia’s globally unique natural and cultural heritage are sorely lacking and we’re looking to the Morrison government to demonstrate that it is willing and able to address these shortcomings.”The other signatories to the letter were the Australian Marine Conservation Society, Birdlife Australia, the Bob Brown Foundation, the Colong Foundation for Wilderness, Fight For Our Reef, Humane Society International Australia, Protect Ningaloo, Queensland Conservation Council and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust."
"Ayub Amin Jat treats his camels like his children. But then his camels are no ordinary ungulates: they are a unique breed of camels that swim. Amin Jat’s semi-nomadic ancestors have kept these camels in the Indian state of Gujarat for hundreds of years. Known as kharai camels, their name is derived from the local word khara, meaning saline. During the rainy season, they swim along the Gulf of Kutch, an inlet of the Arabian Sea, to small forest islands and graze on mangroves and other saline-loving plants. Their gently padded hooves help them navigate the wet and salty coastal land with ease and they can swim up to three kilometres (1.8 miles). Immediately after grazing, they drink the rainwater collected in the depressions of the islands. When there isn’t enough water, the herders take them to neighbouring villages to feed them. But kharai camels are disappearing. Although exact numbers are hard to find – kharai camels were only recognised as a separate breed in 2015 – local nonprofit Sahjeevan estimates that there were more than 10,000 in Gujarat about a decade ago. Now there are fewer than 4,500. Rapid industrialisation in the mangrove swamps and erratic rainfall are destroying the habitat kharai camels rely on for food, and pushing this unique breed to extinction, warn conservationists. “My ancestors gave me these camels,” says Amin Jat, 53. “They are like my kids. How can I see them die in front of my eyes?” Herders and local conservationists point to the activities of the many salt companies in the mangrove swamps. The companies create salt pans by restricting the entry of tidal water in the mangroves. This dries up the plants and eventually kills them. Power plants, ports and other industries are also responsible for the loss of the camels’ habitat, Sahjeevan says. “These companies create mud walls, locally known as bunds, around a portion of land which blocks the tidal water. Without the water, the mangroves die a slow death, making it easier for the machines to uproot them,” says Mahendra Bhanani, camel programme coordinator at Sahjeevan. “One company plundered over 4 sq km of mangrove cover for over a month like this in 2018.” The salt companies argue that they bring development and jobs to an area that is nothing more than wasteland. “The land allotted to us is saline wasteland, on which nothing can grow,” says Bharat Raval, president of the Indian Salt Manufacturers’ Association, which represents more than 60 companies. “There may be a few defaulters but they are very small in number.” G A Thivakaran, a scientist at Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology who specialises in coastal and marine ecology, says that some companies have been going out of their way to get land declared wasteland. “Until about two decades ago, industries were rampantly destroying mangroves. In 2011, the government framed stricter laws and limited development in mangrove areas. But then the companies found a new workaround. They would block the tidal creek, leading the mangrove to die a natural death in about a year. The land would then be declared a wasteland and [could] easily be claimed by industries,” he says.  The Indian government has taken notice of the camels’ decline and in 2015 designated them endangered. “Health camps” for the camels were set up, and nonprofit organisations were given funds to provide breeding and veterinary support to herders. In September last year, herders also won a reprieve from India’s National Green Tribunal, which handles environmental disputes. It asked the Gujarat authorities to check any kind of obstruction in the flow of tidal creeks, and restore mangroves. It also warned against any kind of salt manufacturing activity in certain areas. But herders say their fight to protect the mangroves is ongoing. “It’s a constant struggle. We get one company removed, another one comes up within a week,” says Bhanani. “It’s like perpetual hide-and-seek.” According to India’s forest department, the mangrove cover in Gujarat has, in fact, risen from 1,140 sq km in 2017 to 1,177 sq km in 2019. But the camels are not allowed to graze on the department-owned land, Amin Jat says. “The animal husbandry land is being allotted to companies and the forest department people shoo us away from their land. Where do we go?” Thivakaran says that while the camels trample on the plants, they cannot be held responsible for the depletion of the mangrove cover. “It’s the industries [that are responsible]. Camels and mangroves have coexisted for generations. Moreover, kharai camels mostly graze on sparse or degraded mangroves.” Erratic rainfall in the region compounds the problem. Kutch has a variable rainfall and is hit by drought about every three years. “Because of the salt content in the mangroves, the camels immediately need to drink water after grazing. So low rainfall spells a crisis for us,” says Amin Jat. “We don’t need big buildings. We just need food and clean water for our animals.” Local nonprofits have been lobbying hard against increasing industrialisation in the area but are also working to persuade herders to start selling camel milk as a source of income. Traditionally the community has been averse to the idea of selling camel milk or wool. According to Amin Jat, a revered spiritual leader once discouraged the practice and advised herders to give away the products to anyone who asks. “But of late, many people have started selling the milk to sustain themselves,” he says, sitting in his wooden hut in a village in Kutch as his nephew, Hamir Bhachu Jat, serves us camel milk tea in wide-mouthed steel bowls. Local people believe that the milk of kharai camels is beneficial in the treatment of tuberculosis, diabetes and cancer. “Our people don’t get any major diseases,” Bhachu Jat says. “This milk is medicinal. My uncle sometimes goes without food for as many as five days during his trips to the islands, only surviving on camel milk.” Amin Jat has never had a permanent home. His family typically moves three times a year in search of grazing grounds for their camels. He belongs to the pastoralist community of Fakirani Jats, whose primary occupation has traditionally been camel breeding. Wherever they settle, the women of the family build houses made of reed grass, jute ropes and wood called pakkhas. They mostly use camels to carry their belongings during their migratory tours but, occasionally, sell off a male camel to sustain them through several months. But Amin Jat is not optimistic about the future. “If they don’t stop the industries soon, I will send my camels to a slaughterhouse,” he says.  “The camels’ extinction would not just be an ecological loss but also a cultural one,” Bhanani laments. “It would fundamentally alter the pastoral lifestyle of the Fakirani Jats and other nomadic communities in the region. Younger male members in their families are migrating to cities and seeking jobs to sustain themselves. Interestingly, some are employed by the same companies that are destroying their camels’ habitat.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"The summer boom may be over but there are still insects feeding from the sea hollies in my garden. There’s nectar in their steely grey tops though the lower flowerheads are browning and going to seed. White-tailed bumblebees work fast, probing the tiny clusters of five flowers, interspersed with spiny barbs, that are rhythmically arranged in tall domes. This is Eryngium giganteum, also known as Miss Willmott’s Ghost, which is named after Ellen Willmott, an early guerrilla gardener who left a trail of seeds in the gardens she visited. I’ve seen the native wild eryngo, E maritimum, growing in the gravels of the north Norfolk coast. A shorter plant, its flowers are metallic blue and burr-shaped and, like my garden variety, protected by a silver ruff of viciously spiked bracts. Sea hollies are actually umbellifers and, like so many of the apiaceae, very attractive to insects, in this case to wasps in particular. Hoverflies are now zipping between the flowers and a small copper butterfly is sunning itself in the cup of a pale bract. The sharply spined leaves are sheltering the plump button of a strawberry snail. A spider has anchored its nest to flowers and stems, linking the tops of the sea hollies in a seemingly random series of fine threads. Wisps of thistledown and grass seeds are caught in this chaotic criss-cross mesh. Inside the cat’s cradle of spiderweb is a darker shape, a fleecy rolled-up swaddle blanket studded with shiny petrol-blue fragments of bluebottle, the husk of a wasp. Within this spun chamber is a blue egg-sac from which has emerged a mass of tiny spiderlings with pale olive legs and little round bodies. The mother has long thin legs with dark knee joints, her rotund body a symmetry of brown white and black markings. She’s a mothercare spider, Theridion sisyphium, feeding her young on regurgitated food until they are large enough to share her meals. When she dies, they will eat her body before they venture out across my garden. Frost will pick out the shapes of the sea hollies, the wind will tatter them and in spring when I’m gardening I will find the lacy and beautiful skeletons of their bracts."
"In these troubled times there comes a point where we all need to let off steam. For this huge geyser in Yellowstone park, the moment was now and the eruption was spectacular, after a six-year wait. But, for the rest of us, watching this natural phenomenon is strangely meditative and beautifully distracting from much of the bad news around, despite the violent geothermal forces propelling it. Giantess Geyser spouted for the first time in more than six years in Yellowstone National Park, which straddles part of Wyoming and a little of Montana, on 25 August, according to the US National Park Service (NPS). “She” has more typically erupted between twice and six times a year in the past, according to the NPS website, and blasts a spout up to 200ft high. “The surrounding area may shake from underground steam explosions just before the initial water and/or steam eruptions,” the NPS website adds. Giantess is one of the biggest geysers in the park, alongside phenomena such as the super-tall Steamboat geyser, the largest active geyser in the world, and the park’s most famous, Old Faithful, renowned for its punctual regularity as it soars from the ground about 20 times a day. Colorful hot spring features in the park include the blue-hued Morning Glory Pool and the psychedelic Grand Prismatic spring, as well as whiffy, sulfurous bubblers and roiling natural pots of scalding hot water fizzing out of the rocks. The features are among more than 10,000 hot springs and geysers in the park, a Unesco world heritage site."
"At least 400,000 chickens are being culled in the UK as Covid-19 infections disrupt slaughterhouse routines. About 300,000 birds are due to be culled in England and 110,000 have been culled in Scotland. Chickens that cannot be slaughtered for food are usually gassed with CO2 and their bodies rendered for fat and other animal byproducts. They do not enter the food chain. The UK rears and slaughters about 20 million birds a week, according to the British Poultry Council (BPC). About 95% are chickens and the majority are processed through a few large slaughterhouses, each with a capacity of about 2 million birds a week. Production loss at even one large slaughterhouse can have significant impacts along the food chain and create welfare problems, the BPC said.Millions of US farm animals were culled on-farm earlier this summer after the closure of meat plants because of coronavirus outbreaks among staff that cut the country’s slaughtering capacity for cows and pigs by 25% and 40% respectively. In England, about half of the staff at Banham Poultry in Norfolk have had to self-isolate after 75 staff tested positive for coronavirus. The plant plans “to humanely cull 300,000 birds using a gas system”, said its director, Blaine Van Rensburg, in a statement.Asked about the risk of further culls, Rensburg said: “Given we don’t know how long this current situation will last, we won’t be speculating on how many others will need to be humanely culled.” Rensburg denied earlier reports that Banham had culled about 7,000 birds. “No birds have been culled at our site to date,” he said. “We are already diverting a quarter of a million birds to other suppliers and will continue to do so where possible.” In Scotland, a statement from poultry slaughterer Coupar Angus, which is owned by the 2 Sisters Food Group, confirmed that 110,000 birds had been culled. The slaughterhouse kills “almost one million chickens a week and is the only facility of its type in Scotland,” it said. There are two standard methods for gas poultry culls in the UK: whole house gassing and containerised gassing. The first involves filling the sheds where chickens live with CO2. The second involves putting the birds in specialised containers that are brought to the farm. The containers are filled with CO2 and sometimes other gasses such as argon. “Whole house slaughter is very rare, the sheds are not designed for it,” said Penny Middleton, the poultry policy manager at the National Farmers Union Scotland. “The containerised option is more controllable and would be done by someone like Livetec Systems, an approved depopulator, according to welfare regulations,” she said. No one interviewed would comment on how long gassed chickens take to die, other than to say it was legal and humane.The Coupar Angus statement said the chickens were “humanely dispatched in line with legislation” and that culls were supervised by the government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency and an independent veterinary officer. The statement said that although last week’s Covid-19 related decision to “cease production has brought many upsetting consequences” it managed “to successfully process the large majority of birds from Scotland” by sending them to other slaughterhouses in its UK network. The factory was due to reopen on Monday and no further culls are expected, it said. Middleton said the Coupar Angus plant reopening might take a while to get up to full speed, but that she was not expecting any further culls in Scotland. Peter Stevenson, a policy advisor with UK welfare organisation Compassion in World Farming, said the culls highlighted a food system failure. “Today’s chickens have been bred to grow so quickly that if they are left to continue growing after reaching their slaughter weight, many will become so lame they can barely walk, while others will die of heart disease.” The BPC’s chief executive, Richard Griffiths, said in a statement that because UK poultry processing was so efficient, with little spare capacity, losing a large slaughterhouse “will not only interrupt our national food supply, create shortages and job losses at a time when we can least afford it, but also result in bird welfare challenges on a significant scale”/ He said coronavirus outbreaks at meat plants demonstrated “that no amount of preparation and vigilance can guarantee complete protection against Covid-19. We have to prioritise the health of people in our community, but we also need to safeguard food supply and the welfare of our animals”. The BPC was working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) “and other relevant authorities to ensure reasonable steps are put in place to minimise welfare issues and maintain food supply”, he said. “We must ensure that poultry meat plants compromised by a Covid-19 outbreak are able to maintain throughput where possible, even if it means having skeleton staff onsite.” Defra did not confirm chicken cull numbers but said birds “would be culled using gas … in line with the rules on protecting animal welfare at the time of killing.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"Sewage sludge containing human waste from the Netherlands has been passed for import to the UK, to be used on farmland as fertiliser, despite concerns over the safety of its use. Spreading the sludge on farmland is banned in the Netherlands, where incineration is preferred, but allowed in the UK. Dutch water authorities are eyeing the UK as a possible destination for their sewage, after problems at an Amsterdam incineration company left them lacking disposal options. A permit for the shipment of 27,500 tonnes of municipal sewage sludge was issued in February by the UK’s Environment Agency, according to a document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Greenpeace’s Unearthed investigative unit and seen by the Guardian. The sludge is listed as coming from the Amstel, Gooi and Vecht water board but the identity of the recipient in the UK has been redacted. The permit is valid until February. It is legal in the UK to use sewage sludge on farmland but it must be first treated and then applied under strict regulations. However, the Environment Agency has raised concerns that the regulations are not always followed. In November 2017, the Environment Agency had a report drawn up that listed potential problems for human health from using sewage on farmland, including the presence of pathogens such as E coli and salmonella, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals and microplastics.  It also found the supply chain handling sewage from its origins to its destination on fields was “convoluted”, which raised the possibility of abuse of the regulations and contamination of farmland. Alistair Boxall, a professor in environmental science at the University of York, said Dutch sewage was unlikely to be any worse than that from the UK, but the government was not doing enough to ensure that sewage spread on fields was safe. “The government is doing very little to understand what harm sludge could be doing to humans – they don’t have the data,” he said. “If we can ensure that you don’t have harmful contaminants, then [using sewage] is a good thing. But at the moment really we don’t know whether some of the things in there are safe or not.” A further concern is that using sewage as fertiliser could foster the growth of superbugs, which are resistant to antibiotics. Cóilín Nunan, a scientific adviser at the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, said: “Human sewage can be an environmental source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and of antibiotic residues. Wastewater treatment plants can reduce but not eliminate all the antibiotics and resistant bacteria. “If human sewage is spread on land growing food for human consumption, the possibility of antibiotic resistance being spread to people is greater than if it is spread on land producing other types of crops.” Dr David Spurgeon, an ecotoxicological researcher at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said there were benefits to using sewage on farmland: “It is a way of returning nutrients to soil, which means we can reduce the use of mineral fertilisers, it helps build soil structure which helps avoid soil erosion, and it returns carbon to the soil which can help with meeting carbon reduction targets.” Sewage treatment, though effective in removing many chemicals, was “not perfect, and there are some chemicals that can survive treatment” and other contaminants and pathogens that could get into the food chain, he added. “Sludge to land does need some management and that is why there is a code of practice to try to limit any issues,” Spurgeon said. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the government’s oversight was not working, and pointed to cases in recent years where the rules had been violated, and concerns raised in the Environment Agency’s 2017 report over enforcement. Sauven said: “The UK’s sewage sludge supply chains are already full of shady middlemen and waste brokers getting their hands dirty exploiting its opacity and the resulting regulatory failings. This is why the sludge that is spread on to our farms and fields has become such a toxic cocktail of plastics, chemicals and bacteria. “Add waste from the Netherlands into the mix and the risk of further contamination is only going to skyrocket. The Environment Agency really needs to get its own house in order before we allow the UK to become a dumping ground for other countries’ polluted sewage.” A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: “We take our responsibility to protect the environment very seriously and our new sludge strategy ensures farmers’ use of this fertiliser is based on the latest scientific data. While spreading waste can have beneficial impacts on the land when used as a substitute for manufactured fertilisers, we are clear this practice must not harm the environment. “We will not hesitate to take enforcement action against those who fail to manage any risks appropriately – including prosecution in the most severe cases.”"
"Light brightens the tent and nudges me out of sleep. Dawn must have arrived. I open my eyes, expecting morning light, but instead see soft silver shapes flickering across the tent fabric – moonbeams, diffused through the swaying limbs of the huge Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) under which my tent is pitched. My watch says 3.34am. I unzip the door of the tent and look outside. The previous day was overcast, but the weather is restless and squally, and the wind has torn open a rift in the clouds. The moon is startling in its unsullied brightness. Metallic light plays across the dark forest. Blaeberry and heather bushes, wet with rain, gleam in the lunar glow. Moonlit scraps of cloud drift across the sky like smoke. The trees of Glen Feshie are an ecological link to 9,000 years ago: one of the few remaining remnants of the coniferous rainforest that spread across Britain after the last ice age. As the climate continued to warm, the conifer canopy retreated north into Scotland, but this “Caledonian forest”, as dubbed by Pliny the Elder, remained big enough 2,000 years ago to help halt the march of Roman armies. By the 20th century, human-driven deforestation and a wetter climate reduced the Caledonian forest to a handful of isolated enclaves; as little as 1% of its historic extent. But in Glen Feshie, as in many other parts of the Scottish Highlands, the forest is resurgent. Deer numbers in the area have been cut back, and in less than two decades the great 300-year-old “granny pines” that survived deforestation have been joined by a layer of vibrant new growth. Reaching this camping spot, in a natural dome created by the interlocking canopies of several veteran trees, involved careful “bushwhacking” past reefs of bright heather, clusters of infant pines, and grassy meadows vibrant with the late-season colours of devil’s-bit scabious, harebell and yarrow. This level of natural abundance is too rare in the mountain landscapes of Scotland and Britain. I zip the tent back up as the clouds close up and another squall approaches; but the trees shield me from the wind and rain, and I sink back easily into sleep."
"Australian scientists say they are prevented from speaking openly about their work and their advice is being suppressed by government and industry when it comes to the impact of logging, mining, land-clearing and the climate crisis, new research suggests. A study by the Ecological Society of Australia, published in the journal Conservation Letters, surveyed 220 scientists across government, industry and academia on the extent to which their work had been suppressed. Forms of suppression include not being able to present or publish results, changes being made to findings before the work is released and self-censorship due to fear of retribution. The society found about a third of government and industry-employed ecologists and conservation scientists who responded said they had experienced undue modification of their work. About half the government scientists and nearly 40% of those working for industry said they had been blocked from releasing or discussing what they had found either publicly or internally where they worked. Slightly more than half of all respondents (56%) said they felt the constraints on public commentary had become more severe in recent years. This was most often the case in commentary about the plight of threatened species, with 56% of industry, 46% of government and 28% of university scientists working in the area reporting they felt limited in what they could say. University and industry researchers were more likely to avoid public commentary due to fear of misrepresentation in the media, while government employees were most often constrained by their manager or workplace policy. Don Driscoll, the lead author and a past president of the society, said the study showed that some of Australia’s best scientists were being prevented from sharing their work not only with the media and on social media platforms, but with colleagues and policymakers through peer-reviewed journals and at conferences. He said the potential consequences were profound as it meant policies on issues such as climate change, bushfires and regulation of development proposals may not be informed by the best science. “In reality, these findings may be the tip of the iceberg,” he told Guardian Australia. “It reflects on a type of corruption that’s going on in the system.” Driscoll, who is also the director of the Centre for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University, said many industry-employed scientists were consultants hired to assess the environmental impact of proposed developments. Those scientists were often left with no recourse if the work they did was modified before being presented to a government in a development application as their contracts prevented them speaking publicly. Similarly, he said, scientists that worked within government departments and agencies faced an increasingly politicised system in which information was often filtered by public servants and ministerial staff before reaching politicians. As the survey was opt-in it reflects only the experience of the sample who chose to take part, but the eight scientists behind the study said the respondents were an accurate reflection of the scientific workforce across age, gender and type of work. Driscoll said the findings suggested a politicised culture in how science was dealt with and showed the power of vested interests, and highlighted the need for an independent watchdog such as a national Environment Protection Authority to assess development proposals and determine whether they should go ahead. “It’s vital our environmental assessments are changed so that the people doing the damage are not employing the scientists doing the assessment of the damage to the environment,” he said. Euan Ritchie, a Deakin University associate professor in wildlife ecology and co-author on the paper, described the study as “pretty clear evidence the democratic process, which is based on having an informed public, is being interfered with”. He said it also showed that suppression of scientists’ work was having a heavy toll on their mental health. The paper includes anonymous quotes from respondents who said they had been threatened with losing their job if they spoke up after their advice was ignored, were intimidated by senior public servants on the phone and social media, and had quit their position due to stress and loss of motivation. Ritchie said the stress of having work suppressed ran alongside a “baseline eco-anxiety and eco-grief” that many scientists experienced. “It’s a serious and insidious mental health issue that hasn’t been addressed properly,” he said. The research was undertaken before an ongoing review of national environment laws by Graeme Samuel, the former head of the competition and consumer commission. In an interim report in July, Samuel found the laws were ineffective, the environment in decline, and advised the government to introduce an independent watchdog to ensure its protection.  Samuel also recommended the introduction of national environment standards to ensure conservation protection improved while the Morrison government handed greater development approval powers to the states and territories. The government last week gagged debate while forcing legislation to start that process through the lower house of parliament. The proposed changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act did not include environmental standards as promised. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said they would be introduced later. Driscoll said the government decision to rule out an independent watchdog and introduce laws without including environmental standards was “a major mistake” and showed what could happen when MPs did not listen to scientific advice."
"AGL, one of Australia’s largest energy companies, has launched the country’s first subscription service for electric cars in a move that the EV industry hopes may boost the nation’s low uptake rate. The company announced a pilot phase for the new scheme, which also includes installation of charging stations at customers’ homes, to cover Sydney and Melbourne. The industry group the Electric Vehicle Council, which last month announced sales of electric vehicles had tripled between 2018 and 2019, said AGL’s move was a glimpse into the future of the electric vehicle market. AGL said it hoped the subscription service, available only to its own customers, would remove the barriers for people to drive electric cars – namely, the high upfront costs and the desire for a charging station at home. Under the service, subscribers pay an $800 set-up fee and then a weekly price for a car starting at $299 that includes the installation of a charging station as well as insurance, maintenance and registration. The AGL executive John Chambers told Guardian Australia the company was looking ahead at the rapid growth of electric vehicles and the role the vehicle’s batteries could play to store energy at homes as well as power vehicles. “That is a frontier for us,” he said. The car batteries were typically six or seven times the size of the residential batteries people installed to store their solar power. Several models of car will be available under the service, AGL said, including Nissan, Tesla, Jaguar and Hyundai. Customers would not be locked into a contract. AGL said the electricity used to charge the batteries would be carbon-neutral through offsets purchased under a government-accredited scheme. Last month AGL announced all its 400 corporate vehicles would be electric by 2030. The company is Australia’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases and has a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In June the company announced it would be linking manager bonuses to its climate targets. The Melbourne-based company JET Charge will install the charging stations for AGL’s subscription scheme. JET Charge’s chief executive, Tim Washington, said the stations can recharge a car battery three times faster than a standard socket and complete a full recharge overnight. “The greatest way to get someone to purchase an electric vehicle is to just get them to try it,” he told Guardian Australia. “So this is a fantastic way for people to be able to try before they buy.” He said energy utility companies in other countries had also set up electric vehicle subscription services and AGL’s move was an example of how the energy market would converge around electric vehicles. He said energy companies were increasingly seeing electric vehicles as a way to store energy that could be fed back into the electricity grid. Washington said JET Charge had grown from employing one electrician in 2014 to a business with 40 staff and 150 contractors that had installed 4,500 charging stations. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, the company was installing about 20 electric charging stations a day.  Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council that represents major car brands and infrastructure companies including JET Charge, told Guardian Australia that upfront costs were a major barrier to people driving electric vehicles. “This is going to make electric vehicles available to more consumers,” he said of AGL’s plan. “More than half of all consumers say they want to buy an electric vehicle but the high upfront price gets in the way.” He said the subscription service for electric vehicles “hints at what the future of this market looks like”, with car sharing and ride sharing schemes also focusing on electric cars. Even though electric vehicles sales tripled in Australia from 2018 to 2019, the 6,718 sold in 2019 only represents 0.6% of new car sales. Jafari said 3,226 electric vehicles had been sold in 2020 up to the end of June. Sales in 2020 may not grow from 2019, he said, but he expected they would be steady when sales of non-electric vehicles were falling."
"Urgent new measures are being taken to address the scale of untreated sewage leaks into rivers and seas as pressure grows on the water industry and government to act. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has set up a taskforce to cut the frequency of sewage discharges into rivers and seas from storm overflows, following revelations in the Guardian that water companies released raw sewage into rivers more than 200,000 times last year. The Environment Agency issues permits to allow water companies to release untreated human waste – which includes excrement, condoms and toilet paper – from storm overflows after extreme weather events, such as torrential rain, to stop water backing up and flooding homes.  But the Guardian data suggests the discharges have become a routine part of water and sewerage management, and critics say it has become a licence for water companies to pollute. On Wednesday, Defra said it had set up a taskforce with the Environment Agency, Water UK, which represents the water industry, and Ofwat, to “reduce the frequency and volumes of sewage discharges from storm overflows.”. Defra said the chief executives of 15 water companies met environment minister Rebecca Pow on Wednesday and she called on them to take further action to protect the environment, improve leakage levels and safeguard water supplies. Campaigners say the sewage releases into rivers are particularly damaging to chalk streams, which are a haven for wildlife. Defra said Pow told the water industry CEOs stronger action was needed to deliver on environmental priorities around the use of storm overflows, chalk streams and leakage, and that the environment minister was setting up a chalk stream summit next month. Pow said: “We discussed a number of issues I feel strongly about, including storm overflows, and how we can work together to see much more ambitious improvements. “This country’s green recovery from coronavirus can only happen if water companies step up and play their part.” The Conservative chair of the environmental audit committee, Philip Dunne, is also pursuing a campaign to change the law to forbid water companies from discharging raw sewage into waterways."
"The UK government has rejected plans to develop an “environmentally unacceptable” coalmine near Druridge Bay in Northumberland after years of fierce opposition from environmentalists. The ministry of housing, communities and local government refused planning permission for the project for a second time, saying the plans for a new open-cast mine in north-east England were “not environmentally acceptable”. The decision brings an end to an almost five-year battle between environmental campaigners and the Banks Group, a Durham-based infrastructure firm, which hoped to extract millions of tonnes of coal for Britain’s steel and cement industries. Tony Bosworth, a climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, described the decision as “fantastic news for our environment, and a tremendous victory for local campaigners”. “Coalmines must be consigned to the history books if we are going to avoid climate breakdown,” he said. “Let’s leave coal in the ground where it belongs, and invest in energy-saving and renewable power to build the safe, clean and fairer future we so urgently need.” Bosworth said the Banks Group should “walk away” from Druridge Bay and “abandon plans for any more new mines”. A source close to the company said it was “highly unlikely” it would appeal against the decision, despite its claims that it could raise the UK’s carbon emissions. Ian Gregory, the Banks Group’s outgoing spokesman, said the decision to block its mine would “create massive extra greenhouse gas emissions” as the UK relies more on imported coal which is “dragged to the UK by train and ship”. The claim is disputed by campaign groups.  “This disastrous move simultaneously grows global CO2 emissions, undermines the north-east’s economy and makes us more strategically dependent on Russia,” he added. The Banks Group brought England’s thousand-year coalmining history one step closer to its end last month by shutting one of the country’s last remaining coalmines in Bradley, near Durham. The closure left only one open cast mine still producing coal in England, near Stavely in Durham. The Green party’s Berwick-upon-Tweed branch welcomed the government’s decision, and credited “five years of persistence and hard work by local residents”. “Northumberland was the cradle of coalmining in the UK, and is rightly proud of the role its communities played in the industrial revolution and of the strength and resilience of those communities,” the party branch said in a statement. “Having been at the forefront of one industrial revolution, this decision means that Northumberland can now be at the forefront of the next one, and lead the way into a post-carbon future.”"
"Gold Coast surfer Nick Slater was paddling in barely waist-deep water when he was attacked by a shark and the 46-year-old may have died before he was helped to the shore, witnesses have said. Tuesday’s incident was the first fatal shark attack at the tourist destination’s beaches since 1958 and it has reignited the debate about the efficacy of nets and drumlines. Witnesses say the shark came within metres of several other board riders on Tuesday evening at Greenmount Beach, a popular surf break with a shark control net and eight separate drumlines (baited hooks) in place to protect beachgoers. The attack is the only second death caused by a shark at a netted beach in Queensland since its shark control program was first introduced in 1962, a statistic often held up to laud the success of the state’s lethal protection measures. Fellow surfer Jade Parker was getting ready to hit the water when he spotted Slater – a local real estate agent – floating motionless next to his board. He waded out to help other surfers and lifeguards bring Slater back to the beach. Parker found a four centimetre tooth lodged in Slater’s board which he said was from “an obvious white pointer”. “It was a good size bite to the board,” he told the Seven Network on Wednesday. “I do not want to get to the gory parts but he was in a bad way. He was not conscious. It looked like he had already pretty much passed away at that point in time.” Fellow surfer Shane Dowling told Guardian Australia he “certainly” had sharks on his mind when he went for a surf at Greenmount beach about an hour before the attack. He and others saw seagulls diving for baitfish which are known to attract sharks. “Everyone thinks about sharks if you’re surfing – everyone knows they can come beyond the nets,” Dowling said. “The exact spot where he got attacked is where he was standing the day before. They’ve been packing in a lot of sand and it’s built the beach right out. It was really murky from the sand and really rough in that spot. It was only waist-deep water.” Dowling said he saw something out beyond the shark nets as he came in from his surf. “I had a good look at it because I thought it might be in the shark net. I could see splashing. It just looked odd. Maybe it was shark feeding on the school behind the net before I came in.” Witnesses said the shark took a large chunk – about the size of a basketball – from Slater’s surfboard. The wounds on his upper leg were significant. “It was a pretty severe attack and the ambulance and paramedics were here and did what they could, but it was to no avail,” the Gold Coast’s chief lifeguard, Warren Young, told the ABC. The Gold Coast’s reputation for relatively safe beaches is a drawcard for tourists. The incident on Tuesday has prompted new conversations about the effectiveness of nets and drumlines to protect beachgoers and whether they create a false sense of security for swimmers who mistakenly think are a catch-all defence. The local mayor, Tom Tate, a long-time advocate of shark control programs, on Wednesday flagged he would speak to the state government about additional measures. “It brings to reality, when we go off the land we go into the water, it is the shark’s domain. The danger’s there,” Tate said. “Let me speculate that maybe there are sonic solutions that could do better and we should have a look at that ... but one of the options might be to continue with the current solutions. “Together with the minister, I will be analysing what is the better remedy ... but let’s be guided by the experts. I’m sure we can come up with best solution for our beaches.” The state premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she believed Queensland’s shark control program had been saving lives for generations. “If improvements can be made, then of course they should be, but the ultimate goal has to be protecting human life,” she said. The premier praised Parker and the other rescuers who helped Slater as “heroes”. “The courage to run into the surf moments after a shark attack is beyond admirable,” she told parliament. Shark experts said no protection measures can make any place safe. “The shark nets aren’t there to stop sharks coming through,” said George Roff, an ecology professor from the University of Queensland. “They’re 400-600 metres away from the main beach and they don’t [stretch across the length of the beach] to block everything coming in.” Roff said there was no evidence that nets or drumlines prevent or reduce attacks. He said drones and other detection measures were more effective at mitigating risk. “The idea that you can control sharks, in general, is wrong,” he said. Two tiger sharks have been caught in a net and on a drumline near Greenmount beach since the fatal attack but it’s not known if they are linked to Slater’s death. Beaches remain officially closed to swimmers from the New South Wales border to Burleigh Heads. - with Australian Associated Press"
"The Morrison government started preparing controversial legislation to amend Australia’s environmental laws before it had received a report from a formal review into whether the act was working. The environment department instructed the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to begin drafting the changes to the legislation on 19 June, 11 days before the government received the interim report of the review of Australia’s national environment laws. Labor, the Greens and environment groups say the evidence, provided in answers to a Senate committee, suggests the government never intended to adopt the expert advice of the review, chaired by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel. Samuel delivered his interim report, a once-in-a-decade statutory review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, to the government on 30 June. It found Australian governments had failed to protect Australia’s unique wildlife and habitats and recommended an overhaul of the laws to make the country’s systems of environmental protection more effective. Samuel recommended the devolution of approval powers to the states along with the introduction of national environmental standards and an independent regulator to enforce the law. In July, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, rejected the recommendation of an independent regulator, but said she would put a bill to parliament that streamlined the approval process and promised to introduce prototype standards to ensure environmental protection at the same time. But the bill introduced in August was a near replica of failed “one-stop-shop” legislation introduced under former prime minister Tony Abbott. It contained no reference to any of Samuel’s other recommendations, including national standards. It passed the lower house last month after the government gagged debate. In answers to the Senate committee, the environment department said it instructed the office of parliamentary counsel to start work on the bill after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, gave a speech on 15 June in which he said the government’s ultimate goal was to introduce “single touch” environmental approvals for developments. “The prime minister noted that this would be further informed by the EPBC Act review,” the department said. The department told the committee Samuel held meetings in May and June “in relation to the directions of the interim review, sharing his suggestion that devolution should be progressed”. This included a 4 June meeting with senior bureaucrats from the states and territories. Labor and the Greens said the responses to the committee showed the government had ignored the independent review process. Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said the government had been “caught out” rehashing Abbott’s failed 2014 environment laws before even receiving Samuel’s interim advice. “They have ignored their own independent review, broken their promise on national environment standards, cherry-picked the report, gagged debate in the parliament, and then rammed through a rehashed Tony Abbott bill, which is bad for the environment and bad for business,” she said. The Greens’ environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the government had been disrespectful to Samuel and engaged in bad process and policy. “The government has shown their absolute arrogance by dismissing the expert advice before it had even been made available to them,” she said. She said the Senate should not consider any changes to the laws until Samuel’s final report was tabled in October. A spokesman for Ley said drafting instructions on the bill were initiated by the department. “The government will consider a broader response and additional opportunities for reform once the reviewer provides his final report to government,” he said. Suzanne Milthorpe, the national campaign manager at the Wilderness Society, said it had “become increasingly obvious” that the Morrison government was running a “two-track process” – asking the public and experts for their views through the review while simultaneously acting on predetermined decisions made “in favour of vested interests”. “If they want to begin to re-establish trust here they should pull the Abbott-era bill before parliament, wait until the full review is completed and then bring the complete reforms forward together in one package,” she said. Basha Stasak, from the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Samuel’s report had warned against the approach adopted by the Abbott government in 2014, in part because it lacked legislated national environmental standards. “Yet before the federal government had even received Prof Samuel’s interim report, it was already drafting legislation to hand over environmental responsibility to weaker state regimes without national standards,” she said. Crossbench senators have indicated they will not support the proposed changes, in part because they include nothing to improve the protection of Australia’s ailing wildlife and natural heritage."
"A mouse-sized elephant shrew that had been lost to science for 50 years has been discovered alive and well in the Horn of Africa. The Somali sengi mates for life, can race around at 30km/h and sucks up ants with its trunk-like nose. But it had not been documented by researchers since 1968. In 2019 scientists set out to search for the animal following tips from the region, but not in Somalia, from where the only past reports had come, but in neighbouring Djibouti. Locals were able to identify the creature from old photographs with Houssein Rayaleh, of Association Djibouti Nature, saying he had seen the animal before. The team tapped into local knowledge, and the fact that the sengis need shelter from birds of prey, to set traps in likely locations, baiting them with a concoction of peanut butter, oatmeal and yeast. They caught a Somali sengi in the very first trap set in the dry, rocky, landscape, identifying it by the tuft of fur on its tail that distinguishes it from other sengi species. “It was amazing,” said Steven Heritage, a research scientist at Duke University in the US. “When we opened the first trap and saw the little tuft of hair on the tip of its tail, we just looked at one another and couldn’t believe it. A number of small mammal surveys since the 1970s did not find the Somali sengi in Djibouti – it was serendipitous that it happened so quickly for us.” The team was happy not to witness any looming threats to the sengi’s habitat, which is largely unsuitable for human activities such as development or agriculture, suggesting a secure future for the creature. “Usually when we rediscover lost species, we find just one or two individuals and have to act quickly to try to prevent their imminent extinction,” said Robin Moore, of the Global Wildlife Conservation (GWC) group. The team set more than 1,000 traps at multiple locations and saw 12 sengis in total, obtaining the first photos and video of live Somali sengis for scientific documentation. DNA analysis showed that the Somali sengis are most closely related to other sengis that live as far away as Morocco and South Africa. This meant they have now been placed in a new genus, Galegeeska. It also meant that that an animal with a territory smaller than an average-sized backyard has somehow dispersed across great distances over time, leaving biologists with a new sengi evolutionary mystery to solve. Sengis are most closely related to aardvarks, elephants and manatees. Andrew Taylor, the chair of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s specialist group covering sengis, said: “In a single expedition to a part of Africa that is challenging to work in, the team have achieved remarkable success. Not only have they formally documented the continued existence of the Somali sengi for the first time in 50 years, they have also corrected our understanding of the species’ genus.” “For us living in Djibouti, we never considered the sengis to be ‘lost’, but this new research does bring the Somali sengi back into the scientific community, which we value,” Rayaleh said. “For Djibouti this highlights the great biodiversity of the country and shows that there are opportunities for new science and research here.” The GWC’s Search for Lost Species project includes a 25 “most wanted” list, with the Somali sengi previously the fifth creature waiting to be rediscovered. The others include Jackson’s climbing salamander, in Guatemala, and Wallace’s giant bee, in Indonesia. “This wonderful sengi rediscovery fills us with renewed hope for the remaining small mammal species on our most wanted list, such as the De Winton’s golden mole and the Ilin Island cloudrunner,” said Moore."
"The surface of Wastwater is so immaculately still that the thought of disturbing it with a swim seems like blasphemy.  Earlier in the morning, social media reliably informed me that Wasdale was “overcrowded”. In the balmy grip of an August heatwave, Twitter gave the impression that the whole valley had been turned into a chaos of clogged roads, dirty campers and “wrong sorts” leaving devastation in their wake. But here on the shingly shore of Wastwater, on the edge of a wood, we have the place completely to ourselves. Where are the invading hordes? From here we can see right down the length of Wasdale: pyramidal Great Gable at the head of the valley, framed by the slopes of Yewbarrow and the Scafell massif. The view is a photographic cliche, but several days of stomping around the fells before this have rekindled my appreciation for Wasdale, with its formidable but familiar mountain forms, and right now it seems as beautiful as if I’d seen it for the first time. My girlfriend slips in first, sending perfect circles rippling out across the clear pane of the water. I wade into the pebbly, olive-green shallows and swim out into England’s deepest lake, with the water soon darkening beneath me. This is an oligotrophic lake, naturally nutrient-poor, but there are a few fish to be found here – including the rare Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) – and I hear soft gloops around me. A crane fly, a living legacy of the Cretaceous, skims over the surface of the water, seems to give me a quick inspection, and wobbles off. The craggy wall of the Wasdale Screes is big, brutal and sublime, but softened by rays of hazy morning sunshine streaking down between its gothic crags and buttresses. A peregrine flies through one of the sunbeams, pursued by a croaking raven. Some distance from the shore, I float on my back in the water, looking up at the sky and the Screes. When I come out of the trance, I look back in horror to see the masses have finally overrun our idyll: a young family playing on a paddleboard, seemingly having a great time of it."
"Largely solitary, nocturnal, venomous and pint-sized, slow lorises are strong contenders for the primates that least resemble humans. Which may be why they are among the least studied, least protected and most poorly understood primates, according to Anna Nekaris, professor of primate conservation and biological anthropology at Oxford Brookes University. “Out of over 600 primate species, we have five great apes, and everybody wants to study them,” she says. While the plight of orangutans and gorillas has been well publicised, all nine species of slow loris, spread across southern and south-east Asia, are quietly decreasing in number and slipping down the IUCN red list. Philippine, Kayan and Bornean slow lorises are classed as vulnerable; Pygmy, Bengal, Sumatran and Sunda slow lorises are endangered; while Bangkas and Javans are critically endangered. Nekaris (pictured) has been devoted to lorises (there are slender lorises in India and Sri Lanka, too) since 1994, and is on a mission to help them through her research and conservation organisation Little Fireface Project. Spearheading these efforts is a field programme in Java, Indonesia, where she is directing the first long-term study of lorises in the wild. “It took about four years before the [local] farmers started taking us seriously,” says Nekaris. Key was teaching children about lorises through a nature club and the Slow Loris Forest Protector programme, making hunting and littering bans matters of local pride, and working with farmers on growing methods and infrastructure to benefit both them and the displaced Javan slow loris. Nekaris says the main threat to the animals has been habitat loss. Java is the most populous island on the planet, with about 130 million people on an island the size of New York state. Little more than 7% of its forests remain. “Somebody’s gone and taken all the tropical hardwoods and sold them for their wood … There are virtually no lowland rainforests left on Java,” says Nekaris. “It’s a miracle there are any [lorises] at all.” The protected national parks are at too high an altitude for naturally forest-dwelling slow lorises. Their home ranges can be 25 hectares (61 acres), but lorises creep rather than leap, and rely on vines in the canopy to get around. “The ones we’re studying,” says Nekaris, “are living in a human-dominated landscape, in hedgerows around tea, coffee and tomato fields.” While this has made it easier to attach radio collars to study them, says Nekaris, in the absence of joined-up forest the animals have to cross about 200 metres of ground to reach the next clump of trees. “There are predators such as leopards and dogs, and there are humans trying to catch them,” she says. Slow lorises are part of the illegal wildlife trade in Asia. Once they have been captured, their teeth are clipped to ensure they cannot bite and they are sold as cute, docile pets, or used as props for holiday photos in tourist areas. With those vast eyes in teardrop markings, they look like cuddly toys and get a lot of likes on social media. In reality, they grow bloated from a poor diet and their eyes fail from light exposure. But unlike the great apes, with their relatable facial expressions, a slow loris’s misery may be hard to spot. When tickled, they shoot their arms up as if enjoying the experience but it is actually a sign of distress. Their cry is ultrasonic, which means it is at too high a frequency for humans to hear. As well as their fatal cuteness, slow lorises are believed by some to be the animal that can cure a hundred diseases and are sought after for use in traditional medicines.  In December 2019, Nekaris published the results of a successful study into whether building a network of bridges could make up for the lack of safe passage in tree canopies and improve the lot of the Javan slow loris. It was a conclusion reached by trial and error. At first, Nekaris had installed some ladder-like bridges between trees that were used elsewhere in monkey conservation, but the lorises didn’t take to them. Then she realised that the answer might lie with some of the local farmers’ irrigation pipes. Because of the hilly terrain, some of the pipes were suspended high above ground level, and lorises had been seen crossing them. Nekaris hit on the idea of installing more of them, which would benefit the farmers, too. Twelve days after installation, motion-sensor cameras showed the animals starting to creep across the new pipes. Nekaris witnessed the animals grow in confidence, she says, “because they’re in the air. They’ve increased their home range sizes, and the areas within the home ranges that they can use.” With funding from the People’s Trust for Endangered Species in the UK, and Cleveland zoo in the US, there are now more than 20 water-pipe bridges in place. The bridges allow the lorises to reach previously inaccessible feeding trees, where they gouge out gum with their teeth. Nekaris also found the lorises could spend less time travelling, more time feeding and, crucially, get enough rest. An added benefit of using water pipes is that the farmers have a vested interest in their maintenance. “The longest bridge is about 400 metres,” says Nekaris. “Some of them have to go over multiple farmers’ lands so you have to negotiate with them to work together.” Getting the piping to the farms has become, she says, “a community event because people have to bring it up the mountain on motorbike. You have to find the water source to connect it to and then get it to travel where it needs to go. And then the interesting thing was, of course, other farmers started saying, ‘Well, I don’t have slow lorises on my land and I didn’t get a bridge. It’s not fair.’ So then as a contingency, we had to give other people bridges as well, even if they didn’t have lorises.”  Nekaris also introduced the idea of shade-grown coffee to the village, growing coffee in its natural habitat of the understory, pollinated by insects, in sustainably fertile soil. Last year, says Nekaris, “we went with the farming community to a herbarium and picked trees that were useful for the animals but also for fixing nitrogen in the soil and preventing soil erosion and landslides.” They included some “cash” trees, too, “which after 10 years could be cut for timber and replaced”. There was the extra incentive of certification from the Wildlife Friendly Enterprise Network, which involved meeting criteria such as hunting bans, introducing FairTrade and organic practices and boosting habitat through shade-grown crops. A local ban on hunting endangered species was agreed in September 2019, says Nekaris, “with all the signs up by October, and that included birds as well”. The villagers agreed to a littering ban, too. “There’s plastic everywhere,” says Nekaris. “And it affects people’s livelihoods all the way down the mountain because it fills the streams that provide their drinking water.” Interest is growing in a new waste management system, and as this environmental awareness trickles down the mountain, so does the plight of the slow loris. A nearby village is discussing joining the hunting ban. Building bridges for the slow loris, says Nekaris, “has started to build bridges within the community”.

"Name: Unlikely face masks. Age: The one in the photo could be 10, 20, maybe even 30. It looks pretty big, but they can get bigger still – depending on the species, of course. I thought this was about face masks. It is, but one particular face covering, spotted in Greater Manchester this week, was a snake … Snake! Where? On a bus, travelling between Swinton and Manchester city centre. Snakes on a Bus! Like Snakes on a Plane on a budget. What kind of snake? Possibly some kind of a python. Alive though, and being used as a face mask? Correct. A man boarded the bus with the reptile wrapped around his neck and the lower part of his face. It must have been terrifying for the other passengers. On the contrary. “No one batted an eyelid,” one of them said. Manchester is so cool. Unless they were terrified – frozen with fear. No, this fellow passenger, who didn’t want to be named, said it didn’t seem to bother anyone and that she found it “really funny”. Massive snake, hahaha. Presumably live snakes can be used again and again, so there’s less environmental impact. Win-win, press the button, ding-ding, next stop Sssssssalford. No, wait, there is a problem. A python isn’t a legitimate face covering. Says who? Says a spokesperson for Transport for Greater Manchester. “Government guidance clearly states that this needn’t be a surgical mask, and that passengers can make their own or wear something suitable, such as a scarf or bandana.” So far so good, but I get the feeling there’s more to come. “While there is a small degree of interpretation that can be applied to this, we do not believe it extends to the use of snakeskin - especially when still attached to the snake.” Boo, boring Transport for Manchester. It’s a bit of fun, and a change from some of the novelty face coverings we saw when PPE was so hard to come by – the helmets, saucepan lids, Plague Doctor masks, coffee filters etc. Maybe, but actually a live snake isn’t a great mask. It can move away from the face; as it is clear from some of the pictures, this one did. And the man wasn’t wearing an actual, traditional, non-serpentine face mask underneath. Not “no masks” tweeter Ian Brown, was it? Maybe. Or Noel Gallagher singing Slide Away, hahaha. What is it about famous Mancs and masks? Anyway, that’s another story. Do say: “Thank you driver, we’ll just slither home from here then, shall we? Don’t say: “The snakes on the bus go hiss hiss hiss, hiss hiss hiss, hiss hiss hiss ...”"
"The year seemed finely balanced as we ambled down to the pond at Little Barbrook in the evening sunshine. Bracken was crisping to bronze and the birch leaves were turning, yet it had been the warmest day in weeks and heat was still radiating off the dusty track. So slipping into the chocolate-coloured water to cool off was a pleasure, knowing all the while that this might be the last swim of summer, a valediction of sorts and a reminder that the seasons still roll along, even in these strange and stressful times. Back on shore and half-dry, we had just started for home when I noticed something shimmering in the dirt. I scooped it up and marvelled: a dor beetle, counted among the dung beetles, its elytra, or wing cases, divided and the wings outspread, as though it had met its end in flight, perhaps taking off too late from the warm earth to escape a bicycle wheel. When I tilted my palm, its black body glittered purplish blue in the long rays of the setting sun, as though I’d discovered a jewel. No wonder the Egyptians thought scarabs divine. Broadly oval in shape, dors are the giants of the British dung-beetle world, and while there are only a handful of species, telling them apart can be difficult. This one was particularly big, being 26mm in length, and the markings on those glittering wing cases suggested Geotrupes stercorarius. We think of dung beetles as rolling balls of dung across the ground, but they are divided into “rollers” and “burrowers”. The genus – Geotrupes, “earth-borer” – gives the game away. This beetle digs, or rather dug, deep shafts under a nourishing pile of dung, and side chambers where the female lays a single egg, bringing small packets of dung for larvae to eat before sealing them inside. Some pupate in the autumn; others wait until spring. Flipping the beetle on its back, I studied its iridescent abdomen, fringed with violet and green, as well as a stronger version of the metallic blue that was a feature of its wing cases. I wanted to keep it, so I nestled my treasure in some damp clothes. But before we even reached the car the brilliance of its colours had faded."
"Volunteers in this year’s Great British Beach Clean are being asked to record the personal protective equipment (PPE) they find, to get a clearer picture of the volume of plastic masks and gloves discarded during the coronavirus pandemic and their impact on the environment. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS), which organises the annual September event, is urging people to organise their own surveys with smaller groups of friends, family and “bubbles”, in line with government guidance. “It’s likely we’ve all seen masks and gloves littering our local area, whether that’s on the coast or on our street” said Lizzie Prior, MCS beachwatch officer. “Much like other single-use litter, face masks and plastic gloves put our seas and marine life in danger. PPE can be mistaken for food and ingested by marine life or trap animals in the elastic straps of face masks as we’ve seen recently. It’s so upsetting to see another form of single-use litter polluting the UK’s beautiful beaches, and we’re determined to ensure this doesn’t become a new normal.” Now in its 27th year, the annual event is a UK-wide long weekend of coastal cleaning from Land’s End to the Shetland Islands. This year it starts on Friday and finishes on Monday. Nearly 11,000 volunteers took part in last year’s clean-up, retrieving an average of 558 litter items for every 100 metres of beach surveyed. Plastic remained by far the most common form of litter (143 pieces per 100 metres), followed by cigarette butts (42) and glass items (33). There were six drinks cans per 100 metres. Among the more unusual items logged were a toilet seat, padlocks, false teeth and circuit boards. Data collected has played a key role in the introduction of the 5p single-use carrier bag charge, the ban on microbeads in personal cleaning products such as shower gels and toothpastes, the commitment to a deposit return scheme in Scotland and the consultation on one in England and Wales, and a ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds in England."
"I’ll never look at a tussock of grass in the same way again. Hidden within this one was a ball of woven fronds that once cradled life like a beating heart at the centre of the dense cluster of stems. We had spent more than an hour searching clumps of vegetation beside heathland in east Devon. The light was fading and the two of us, backs bent and several metres apart, moved from tussock to tussock, parting strands to carefully examine the inner recesses. Finally, my expert guide, Sarah Butcher, called me over. Concealed at knee height amid ranks of vertical stalks was a spherical mass, like a tangle of yarn caught in a loom. This hollow ball of dried blades of grass, small enough to be cupped between two hands, was what we had come to find – a harvest mouse nest. “Lovely to know they’re here,” said Sarah. “Though you’re unlikely to spot harvest mice in the wild – they’re really tiny, and too wary and quick.” The distribution of these thumb-length, gingery-brown mammals is most easily assessed by surveying nests, and Sarah organises the Devon Mammal Group’s harvest mouse project, which runs from October to March. At this time of year, when foliage dies back, the intricately woven constructions suspended above the ground are more visible. Equipped with a prehensile tail to aid climbing, harvest mice (Micromys minutus) live among crops, in reed beds, beside ditches and along field margins in the southern half of Britain. Females build several nests from late spring until autumn, in which they raise separate litters of offspring. Each breeding chamber is used only once and dries out by the time the young leave, after just over a fortnight. Nests that are still green are potentially in use and should be left well alone. We search on without finding another. Sarah would have expected to see more here, she told me, but their populations fluctuate and most don’t live much longer than a year. “They’re declining and incredibly susceptible to weather extremes and cold winters.” The single harvest mouse nest, the first I had ever come across, offered a glimpse into the secretive world where our smallest rodent dwells amid a towering forest of grass stems."
"On his first day as the new science director for the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California in 2016, a giant blue storage locker caught Kyle Van Houtan’s eye. The locker was obscured by a dead ficus plant and looked as if no one had opened it for years. But the label on it intrigued him: Herbarium. He opened it and inside found hundreds of stacked manila envelopes. Each one contained a single piece of seaweed, pressed and preserved on white paper. The collection demonstrated a curator’s attention to detail, with neat labels in tidy handwriting that documented every seaweed’s origin and collector. And it gave Van Houtan and his colleague Emily Miller an idea. While all the hi-tech underwater drones and sensors monitoring the ocean today can document the present, and hint at the future, they have a big blind spot when it comes to telling the past. Modern record-keeping for ocean conditions began about 80 years ago, which might sound like a lot, but “in conservation we need a lot more data than we often have on hand to make an informed assessment of what a healthy ocean is,” says Van Houtan. If people were pressing seaweed even earlier than 80 years ago, they thought, could it be a way to go back in time, and read the history of the sea? “I don’t know how many people have contacted me and said ‘I found a bunch of seaweed [scrapbooks] in our attic, do you want them?” says Kathy Ann Miller, curator of algae at UC Berkeley’s University Herbarium⁠ (no relation to Emily Miller). “And I always say yes, because there could be treasures.” The 18th-century Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, who founded modern taxonomy, practiced the art of pressing seaweed, but it  exploded during the natural history boom of Victorian Britain. These were the days of amateur scientists traipsing around the world, their sketchbooks in hand. While the racier pastimes of stuffing tigers or describing plant genitalia were off-limits to the “gentler sex”, it was socially acceptable for women to go “seaweeding”. Both Queen Victoria and George Eliot pressed seaweed in their day. Some went even further, publishing field guides, with suggestions on proper attire and etiquette. The collections themselves can be exquisite. “People spend a lot of time pressing seaweed, but also taking tweezers, separating out each beautiful branch, so that it’s splayed out nicely,” says Emily Miller, who later took over the study from Van Houtan. “They look like lace spread across the paper.” By the 1870s, the fad had arrived on the California coastline, transplanted by early American settlers who, just like their British counterparts, were mostly women, such as JM Weeks, an eagle-eyed collector who now has a red algae named after her. California, it transpired, was a paradise for seaweeders. As well as its vast kelp forests, the region is home to nearly 800 other species. There is the crinkly, electric-green sea lettuce⁠, the ruffled grape tongue, and hundreds of others, many of which were first identified for science by amateur seaweeders. The Victorian-era collections are true works of art, with purple, red, brown and green algae arranged in eye-catching patterns on sturdy white card and signed in flowing India ink. The seaweed in the Monterey locker that stood out to Emily Miller, however, was the tough, rather unremarkable gelidium, which turned up across the collection. Gelidium flourishes along the wave-battered west coast shore, and varies from sickly yellow clumps to purple coralline fans. Like all seaweed, gelidium needs nitrogen to grow, and Miller began to wonder if she could trace nitrogen samples back through the decades to see how it had changed over time. It was the kind of thinking in which the Ocean Memory Lab, which Van Houtan runs at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, specialises. The lab extracts historical ocean data from the tissues of long-dead marine animals: an antique collection of hawksbill sea turtle shells, for example, tells the story of an animal driven to vegetarianism by a declining coral reef; while seabird feathers dating back to 1890 can be used to better understand the impact of overfishing. Although the lab does not actively acquire natural history specimens, people send in donations: the curved fang of an orca, a giant South Pacific clam shell, a whale’s inner ear bone — all illegal to harvest today, but with a story of the sea to tell. The seaweed specimens only dated back to the 1980s, however, so Miller contacted institutions up and down the California coast, asking if they happened to have any older seaweed collections. Kathy Ann Miller of the University Herbarium was one of those who responded: she dug into her collection and donated tissue from eight gelidium specimens, the oldest 142 years old. After analysing the plants, the Ocean Memory Lab team discovered that the fluctuating nitrogen isotopes in the gelidium matched a historical cycle of upwelling in California. These powerful ocean currents affect everything from schooling sardines to prowling great white sharks, a shifting pattern of currents that oscillate between cooler and warmer phases. Miller realised that, had scientists known earlier that the cycle of upwelling currents could be measured by seaweed, they might have averted some of the great fishery collapses – such as Monterey’s great sardine crash of the 1940s, forever immortalised in John Steinbeck’s Cannery Row. “The original thinking was that overfishing caused the sardine crash,” Miller says. Now, they knew differently: “It was overfishing in combination with environmental factors and the Pacific Ocean experience.” The discovery was a major advance for the lab. Few had expected that anything as delicate as pressed, 142-year-old seaweed could tell such a lively story about the waters where it lived, and the people who pressed it for posterity. “We need these lenses into the past and who would have ever guessed that seaweeds would be the ones. Fish otoliths, sure. Coral, sure,” says Kathy Ann Miller, referring to studier specimens that scientists have investigated for years, “but seaweeds, which we think of as fragile and gooey, actually hold that history, not in their DNA, but in their tissues.” Their study, published in June, extended the record of Californian currents by a remarkable seven decades, back to the 1870s. It also hinted at the toll of human-caused climate breakdown: the shift between warmer and cooler phases once moved in lockstep, explains Miller, but “some of the correlations that we historically have seen are decoupling today.” For Van Houtan it is another step forward in the process of using preserved marine creatures to read the history of the ocean, something that can’t be done with a sensor or sampling equipment. “We have all these drones that are mining the historical ocean: they’re called birds, turtles, whales, and sharks,” he says. “And they’re doing so in a really standardised, rigorous and robust way. So those are our sensors. That’s our sampling equipment.”"
"This summer, Devil’s Pool – a basin where the Wissahickon and Cresheim creeks meet in Philadelphia’s Wissahickon Valley park – drew thousands of daily visitors from out of state, leaving mountains of trash and fresh graffiti on rocks and trees. The attention has concerned and frustrated locals, and brought back an unpopular proposal for deterring swimmers: filling the pool with rocks. Many residents say the real issue is not any new influx of people – but how the cash-strapped city doesn’t have enough park rangers. But after tensions came to head this summer, with most residents wanting more enforcement of the park’s rules and regulations by the city and some worried about keeping the park open for everyone, local officials seemed briefly willing to try anything: the city councilman Curtis Jones said he was supportive of constituents who wanted to fill in the natural pool. The idea has been around for a few years, even supported by some leadership of Philadelphia’s parks and recreation in 2015. But today, the department isn’t currently considering filling the pool. The proposal, while extreme, has become a flashpoint in a long-simmering local debate: how best to protect the historic landmark without completely cutting off the public’s access to it? Nancy Cresenzo, who grew up in and currently lives nearby Philadelphia’s Andorra neighborhood, is a leading force for change at the park, advocating for the city to bring more park rangers to the area and better enforcement of the park’s rules. She estimates about 90% of locals are against filling the pool – but that’s not to say they want visitors to swim, dive and party there either. “The problem is, Devil’s Pool is not safe,” said Cresenzo. “And if Devil’s Pool is a safety concern, why is something not being done?” Swimming in the city’s creeks is illegal and people have died after diving from high rocks or an arched sewer conduit at the pool. The Friends of Wissahickon (FOW), a non-profit that works in partnership with Philadelphia parks and recreation to maintain the park, also warns the water is a fecal-coliform-tainted cocktail of treated wastewater and storm runoff. The pool’s history and importance to numerous Philadelphians is what makes deciding what to do with the basin complicated. It’s unclear if the Lenni-Lenape ever used the basin for rituals, but Devil’s Pool’s name originates from how the tribe believed the water feature was an interface between good and evil. Later, a gazebo was constructed in the mid-1800s to encourage people to meet there during America’s Centennial Exposition, the first official World’s Fair held in the US. The park itself made history in 1868 when it became the first piece of public land set aside for preservation of its natural beauty. For Philadelphians, like Gregory Park who grew up in the Wissahickon Hills neighborhood, Devil’s Pool was one of the many places in the park he would visit as a child. Today, he visits the park with his children, where they explore the creek themselves. Based on estimates from FOW, daily usage of the park increased 10% on average between March and August, compared to the same time period last year. In July, when the number of visitors at the park was at an all-time high according to Philadelphia’s parks and recreation, park rangers reported 5,000 cars vying for about 100 legal parking spots. As an avid cyclist, Josh Haims, who lives nearby, notes that the increase in visitors over the years has hastened erosion of trails and walkways in popular areas due to increased foot traffic and people cutting new paths. In some areas, like those near Devil’s Pool, trails that were once narrow are now 5ft wide. He believes the park’s issues stem from the decrease in funding from Philadelphia’s parks and recreation, which just faced its largest cut of over $12.5m in funding for the upcoming fiscal year, and the city’s reliance on private organizations to supplement the difference. “States cannot rely on private funding to run their public parks. What’s happening here is a canary in a coalmine for what’s to come [nationwide] if we don’t invest in our park spaces,” said Haims. Philadelphia’s decline in its parks and recreation budget isn’t unique. Budget cuts to parks are common during times of economic uncertainty. In May, a survey by the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA), found that 31% of park agencies are already making cuts to their 2020-21 budget. Another survey by the organization found that 94% of state and local leaders anticipated a decreased tax revenue to force cuts in a variety of park programs and functions next year. In response to the budget cuts and the few park rangers in the area, Philadelphia’s parks and recreation set up additional signage throughout the area and in July dispatched social distance ambassadors, who would’ve normally worked in the city’s pool system, at popular entrances to the park and trailheads to remind people that swimming is not allowed and the government-mandated mask mandate. Maita Soukup, a spokesperson for parks and recreation, said the program was a success, citing how ambassadors also handed out thousands of masks and trashbags, and will continue in some form next year. FOW doesn’t believe Devil’s Pool should be filled with rocks; instead, the organization is exploring a number of other ideas to keep the area clean, like increasing the number of bathrooms in the park, according to Ruffian Tittmann, the head of FOW. But she believes the city needs to seriously consider bringing back more park rangers. Cresenzo sees the battle over the future of Devil’s Pool as an extension of broader challenges facing the park – namely, how to keep it safe and open to all while the staff faces budget cuts – and remains optimistic that the community can do a lot to take care of the park while the city decides how to act next. The current changes alone, according to Cresenzo, have brought a “tremendous improvement to the park”. She’s still going to continue her advocacy for more park rangers and see what can be done at Devil’s Pool. “My friend was walking by Bells Mill Road Bridge [over the Wissahickon Creek] the other day and she said, ‘There’s no trash. There’s no trash on Bells Mill Road.’ It doesn’t mean we’re going to stop all the litter, but I’d say we’ve gained control of the park – and it’s a lot better for that,” said Cresenzo."
"Ships carrying live animals are at least twice as likely to suffer a “total loss” from sinking or grounding as standard cargo vessels, the Guardian has found.  In the past year alone there have been two disasters involving animals in transit. Last November, at least 14,000 sheep drowned after the Queen Hind capsized en route to Saudi Arabia from Romania. And last month, Gulf Livestock 1, a carrier transporting almost 6,000 cattle, sank off the Japanese coast en route to China from New Zealand. Forty crew members remain missing and are presumed dead. “With the Guardian’s shocking findings … [it’s] time for an open and honest assessment of an industry that has caused one crisis after another,” said Prof Kristen Stilt, director of Harvard’s animal law & policy program, currently writing a book about the transport of live animals. “That assessment should recognise that the transport of chilled and frozen meat is the way that nearly all meat travels in commerce today. The idea of sending live animals is a holdover from a bygone era.” The global live export trade is worth nearly £16bn. For decades, campaigners have been calling on the EU to provide better protections for animals in transit, and an inquiry into the regulatory system is under way. According to Guardian analysis, between January 2010 and December 2019 five livestock vessels were recorded as lost to sinking or irrevocable grounding, killing crew and animals. The total equates to just over 3% of the estimated 150 livestock carriers above 100 gross tonnes (GT) known to operate worldwide. The 100 GT measurement is used by the shipping industry to separate smaller vessels, often owned for pleasure, from larger, more probably commercial, ones. The same loss calculation for the global cargo fleet of about 61,000 ships over 100 GT, shows that 471 vessels within that tonnage (excluding tugs, dredgers, fishing and passenger vessels), were lost to sinking or grounding in the same period – or less than 1%. The Guardian’s risk calculations are based on historical data from insurer Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty’s Safety and Shipping Review 2020, analyst IHS Markit and the International Maritime Organization.If the loss figure for livestock vessels expands to include two more vessels, sunk in December 2009 and September 2020, just outside the 10 years covered by the Allianz shipping safety report, used as a basis for the calculation, then the figure rises to 4.7%. Ships carrying animals appear to be at more risk because of a number of factors. Estimates suggest that least 80% of livestock carriers were originally constructed for other purposes and have been converted, rather than purpose built. “Historically, the majority of livestock carriers have been converted container ships and ro-ros [roll-on/roll-off vessels]. But even passenger vessels and oil tankers have been turned into livestock carriers,” said Capt Samson Rathaur, senior marine risk consultant with Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty. Adam Kent, managing director of market analyst Maritime Strategies International, offered similar figures. “Only about 20% of the current livestock fleet was originally designed to carry livestock,” he said. The age of the world’s livestock carriers can also be a problem. Rathaur said many were often already near or at the end of their shipping life, making the fleet “one of the oldest sectors in shipping”. Kent estimated the livestock fleet’s average age at 36 years, 16 years more than the 20-year average age for the global merchant shipping fleet. All of the livestock ships lost in this period were originally built for another purpose. In one case the ship – a ro-ro cargo vessel – had not even been converted to carry livestock. All but one of the livestock carriers lost were more than 20 years old. Owners of higher-end livestock carriers argue against tarring all ships with the same brush. For example, Livestock Express, which owns 13 purpose-built ships and one conversion, says the average age of its ships is 14 years. Livestock Express is owned by the Dutch company Vroon and is described as the “world’s biggest independent seaborne livestock carrier”. Asked about higher livestock ship losses, Paul Pistorius, the company’s managing director, said he was “obviously aware” of a number of tragic incidents over the past 10 years. “All of these casualties have involved converted vessels, many of which have been older than 30 years.” Kent said that while the Guardian’s calculation was “sound” and seemed to indicate “something amiss in the global livestock fleet”, the risk applied mainly to older conversions. He said that “some very good quality conversions” existed, “though we don’t tend to hear about these ships very often, only about those with which there are problems”. Another significant factor is that live animals move around in transit, unlike containers. “When these vessels are converted, animal behaviour is not always a factor in their design,” said Rathaur. Switching to a moving cargo without due consideration could affect a vessel’s stability, he said. “During heavy weather, animals can get distressed and move together to one side, which can potentially list the vessel.” The tiers that many livestock conversions add to increase carrying capacity were another stability risk, he said. Manure and urine also had corrosive effects on steel. Fermenting manure releases moisture, ammonia and carbon dioxide. In conjunction with chloride naturally excreted by animals, the resulting slurry could be “very corrosive to steel structures and ill-maintained ships and can, over time, have a serious impact on the structural strength of the decks,” Rathaur added. He said livestock shipping also had a human resources problem, because crews working on livestock carriers might have “little, if any” training or experience in livestock management before joining their first livestock ship. Using data from the Paris MoU shipping inspector, the Guardian found the most recent three-year rate for livestock ships being detained after inspections was almost 9%. For general cargo/multipurpose ships that average was just less than 6.5%. The Paris MoU is a memorandum of understanding between 27 countries that aims to eliminate substandard ships. It carried out almost 18,000 inspections in 2019. Detained ships are usually kept in port until problems identified by inspectors are resolved. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), a trade association, would not comment on the higher risk of loss for livestock ships exposed by the Guardian. In an emailed statement, the ICS marine director, Jonathan Spremulli, said: “We need all incidents to be thoroughly and robustly investigated and detailed reports to be made available as soon as possible so that lessons can be learned and appropriate actions taken to prevent similar occurrences.” Spremulli added: “The ICS continues working with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to ensure ships are built, maintained and operated in accordance with a robust regulatory framework which is continually under review and being improved.” In many, but not all cases, ship loss investigation reports are filed in the IMO’s Global Integrated Shipping Information System marine casualties and incidents database. Of the seven livestock ships lost since 2009, three reports are currently available. Two mention animal movement as an aggravating factor in already difficult circumstances. All three reports contain safety improvement recommendations. Most specifically, the report for the Danny F II, lost in December 2009 with the deaths of 40 crew and 28,000 animals, suggests a set of rules be established “for the construction and/or classification of the Lifestock [sic] carriers” because a “large number of livestock vessels currently in service are the result of a conversion from different type of original designs”. A spokesperson for the IMO said the suggestion had been considered by its maritime safety committee, but, for the “IMO to address this, a member state or states would need to submit a proposal for IMO to look further into this issue”.

"Mere glitter dazzles between air and water, disrupting shadows of the surrounding woods, distracting the eye, hovering over occult secrets underwater. The outer world is sedated by bright autumn sunshine while under the surface is a troubled subconscious that gives the place the “discouragement”, the “unbreathing quiet” that Mary Webb attributed to the fictitious Sarn Mere in her novel Precious Bane. Colemere is one of a sentence of meres written by dying ice at the end of its age 10,000 years ago. Down in the thick of the water are woods of weed haunted by carp, and fates with names such as “Jenny Greenteeth” that pull you in. Along the shoreline, where whirligig beetles draw orbital ripples, roots the least water lily, Nuphar pumila, which is similar to the yellow water lily but much smaller; its floating leaves have a bay in them, its stigma discs are starry and remain at the ends of brandy-flask seedheads. This little colony is a relict population; the next nearest to Colemere is in Scotland. They are marooned from the glacial story in a kind of magical substance between land and water, an ecology surviving in Shropshire’s meres and mosses, and now hanging on in the Anthropocene’s red list of endangered species. The water lily needs acidic water, open skies and glittering sunlight, and is doomed by the encroaching shoreline shadow of trees, toxic run-off from fields and canal spill. Some years ago, such pollution killed swan mussels, Anodonta cygnea, beautiful 20cm oval shells, like clasped cigarette cases, concealing the gentle sole of a creature that walks underwater; it is hard to imagine a more fragile innocence poisoned by our spit. The pixels of mere glitter can change into dragonfly or goldeneye, snipe or pochard; their twinkle is forever new, as if the place “was created but an hour gone, and not created for us”, as Webb says. A heron stands with studied indifference at the sailing club compound of parked dinghies, neatly sheeted to stow their playfully nautical traditions and the thrill of capsize. The mere is all so peaceful-looking but it is a place where “the moon would get lost in lily leaves, and times, a heron might stand in the sun”."
"Brazilian meat giant JBS said on Wednesday that it will monitor its entire supply chain by 2025, including problematic “indirect supplier” Amazon farms it currently has no control over, some of which have been linked to illegal deforestation. “As a company we are assuming our responsibility to be a transformation agent for society, to be a catalyst. To build together with everyone a better world, a more sustainable Amazon and a better Brazil,” said JBS global CEO Gilberto Tomazoni in a virtual launch of the JBS Green Platform. The announcement marks a turnaround for the world’s biggest meat company. Environmentalists saw it as a positive step, but some said the deadline was too long to resolve such an urgent issue. Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon and Brazil has come under increasing pressure from international investors and other countries over rising devastation and fires. With Wednesday’s announcement, JBS is the third Brazilian meat company to begin responding to the pressure. The company said its Green Platform will use blockchain technology and cattle movement documents, called GTAs (used for sanitary control), and suppliers that fail to cooperate and comply will be blocked from selling to the company. It will initially roll out the platform in Mato Grosso state, which has Brazil’s biggest cattle herd. “What we are doing will impact the life of future generations in a relevant way,” Tomazoni said. JBS will invest a minimum of £35m and match other donations to a total of £71m to create a Fund for the Amazon to foster sustainable development in communities in the region. One of Brazil’s leading climate scientists, Carlos Nobre, will serve on the fund’s consultative council. “If it works, it will reduce deforestation, because 80-90% of first deforestation is for cattle pasture,” Nobre said of the new tracing scheme. “This will have to be evaluated.” The industry’s problems with Amazon suppliers are well documented and were exposed in a 2009 report by Greenpeace. After its release, Brazilian meat companies cut deals with Greenpeace and federal prosecutors and set up complex systems to monitor farms that sell directly to their slaughterhouses. But in Brazil few cattle farms handle the entire life cycle of their animals, instead sourcing cattle birthed or fattened on other farms – the so-called “indirect suppliers”. And despite promising to monitor these indirect suppliers by 2011 in the deal signed two years earlier with Greenpeace, meat companies JBS, Minerva and Marfrig have so far failed to do so. Since July 2019, five investigations by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Brazilian agency Repórter Brasil, Greenpeace and Amnesty International have linked JBS suppliers to illegal deforestation. With pressure mounting, major companies have complained to Brazilian ambassadors and met with Brazil’s vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, in charge of its Amazon Council, and congress leaders. Nordea Asset Management – investment arm of northern Europe’s largest financial services group – dropped JBS from its portfolio in July. Last week a group of European countries – the Amsterdam Declarations Partnership, led by Germany – urged Brazil to take action in the Amazon. On Monday a coalition of NGOs and indigenous groups warned French food retailer Groupe Casino to stop selling beef linked to deforestation in Brazil and Colombia. In July, Brazilian meat company Marfrig promised to monitor all its suppliers 2025 using systems such as Visipec – developed by the University of Wisconsin and the National Wildlife Federation and made available for free. Meat company Minerva is also testing the Visipec system. Until now, JBS had made promises to resolve its supply chain problems but provided no deadlines. “This is very good because it recognises that monitoring indirect suppliers is needed. But the deadline is very long,” said Mauro Armelin, executive director of Friends of the Earth for the Brazilian Amazon. “It could already start using Visipec while it develops its own tool, and it should establish deadlines depending on the slaughterhouse, so plants near conservation units and indigenous lands where there is deforestation have shorter deadlines.” Others were fiercely critical, noting that JBS had promised to monitor its indirect suppliers by 2011. “The company is now giving itself an additional five years to continue to allow deforestation, illegality and human rights abuses in its supply chain in a bid to appease its investors,” said Greenpeace Brasil’s senior forest campaigner, Adriana Charoux. “This is simply unacceptable. The Amazon will have burned down by then.” She also noted that the JBS Green Platform did not include the Pantanal wetlands or Cerrado regions, where fires are currently raging. Some investors were also skeptical. “JBS’s 2025 target for tracing cattle is too far away, we need immediate action,” said Jeanett Bergan, head of responsible investments at Norway’s largest pension fund KLP. “It is a positive step but we have to see the detailed evidence in practice, not least given the controversies that have led to the company becoming a major global divestment target.” Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management, said: “While blockchain solutions need time to develop, 2025 is a long way away - and there are other measures that can be effective before that, for instance stricter controls so that cattle is not bought from owners of approved farms, if they also own farms on disputed land.” Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, welcomed the plan but said JBS will need government help to make it work. “In theory JBS can do what it is promising. But to guarantee it, they will need help with tracing from state and federal governments.” Under far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, such help is unlikely, Astrini said. Bolsonaro has refused to admit Brazil has an environmental crisis on its hands. In his speech opening the UN virtual general assembly on Tuesday, Bolsonaro insisted the country was the victim of the “most brutal disinformation campaigns about the Amazon and the Pantanal wetlands.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"Global governments and major polluters must take urgent action to develop technologies which can capture and store carbon emissions or it will be “virtually impossible” for the world to meet its climate targets, according to the International Energy Agency. The global energy watchdog said carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects should play a central role in meeting climate targets as one of four key pillars in reducing emissions. Carbon capture, said the IEA, should sit alongside plans to electrify economies using renewable energy sources, replace fossil fuels with bioenergy and swap methane-rich gas for clean-burning hydrogen in factories, transport and homes. CCUS technologies typically trap the carbon dioxide produced by factories or fossil fuel power plants before they are emitted into the atmosphere where they contribute to global heating. Once trapped, the greenhouse gas can then be piped into permanent underground storage facilities or sold to buyers who can use the carbon to manufacture plastics, boost their greenhouse crop yields or even make fizzy drinks. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said the process is “critical” in the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy alternatives. “Without it, our energy and climate goals will become virtually impossible to reach,” he said. The IEA also highlighted the “significant potential” of direct carbon capture schemes, which absorb carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere to create carbon neutral economies, but it warned that costs would need to come down. The “slow start” for carbon capture projects means there are only 20 projects in commercial use worldwide but as climate targets begin to mount the race to invest in new carbon capture projects is gaining pace, according to the IEA. Norway is considered a global leader in CCUS but major projects operate in the US, Canada and China too. In the last three years plans for more than 30 commercial CCUS facilities have come forward, representing a potential investment of around $27bn, according to the IEA. But more must be done by governments and high-pollution industries to accelerate the uptake of carbon capture. “Action from governments will be essential for establishing a sustainable and viable market for CCUS,” Birol said. “But industry must also embrace the opportunity. No sector will be unaffected by clean energy transitions – and for some, including heavy industry, the value of CCUS is inescapable.” In the UK major energy companies are developing industrial clusters capable of capturing the carbon to store in subsea caverns in the North Sea seabed. National Grid, Drax and Norwegian state energy giant Equinor last year put forward multibillion-pound plans for the UK’s first carbon-neutral “industrial cluster” in the Humber including hundreds of refineries, factories and the Drax coal-fired power plant. The alliance plans to trial new technology to capture and store carbon emissions from the factory and power plant flues and also hopes to use carbon capture while breaking down natural gas to create hydrogen, which can be used in industry, heating and transport without creating climate emissions. Luke Warren, the chief executive of the UK’s CCS association, said the IEA has identified CCUS as an important weapon in the battle against rising atmospheric emissions due to its unique ability to reduce emissions from key areas of the economy as well as emissions which are already in the atmosphere. “The next decade will be critical for CCUS deployment globally,” he said. “We are confident that the first UK CCUS clusters will be operational by the mid-2020s. This would make a significant contribution to a strong post-Covid recovery whilst making the UK a global leader in this crucial net zero technology.” "
"Scientists have developed a “tiny wind turbine” that can scavenge energy from the breeze made while walking. Imagine rubbing a balloon on your hair for a few seconds – can you hear the crackle of static electricity, see your hair stand on end? That energy, powered by the contact and separation of two materials, can be bottled up and stored for use, according to researchers working on the device. Scientists in China hope the device can generate sustainable power in a low-cost, efficient manner. Once placed on a person’s swinging arm, the airflow is enough to generate power, the researchers said. “Our goal is to solve the issues that the traditional wind turbines can’t solve,” said lead author, Dr Ya Yang, of Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, in a statement. “Unlike wind turbines that use coils and magnets, where the costs are fixed, we can pick and choose low-cost materials for our device.” The device comprises two plastic strips in a tube that flutter or clap together in the presence of airflow. A gentle breeze of 1.6 metres a second is enough to power the device, but it performs best at a speed that ensures the two plastic strips flutter in sync, when wind velocity is between 4 and 8 m/s, the researchers said. The device appears to be a simple, reliable method of generating a small amount of energy that could then be deployed in a variety of ways such as powering remote sensors, security cameras or even a weather station on top of a hill that is otherwise difficult to reach, said Richard Cochrane, associate professor of renewable energy from the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the study. “We won’t see this innovation replacing the big turbines, but we are seeing increasing numbers of these sort of technologies being used for energy harvesting …providing power in places that are otherwise quite hard to get electricity to.” So far, the device has been able to power up 100 LED lights and temperature sensors, its makers said. It also has a wind-to-energy conversion efficiency of 3.23%, which they claim exceeds previously-reported performances on wind energy scavenging. In their paper, published in Cell Reports Physical Science, the researchers show the frequency of the oscillation varies with the wind speed exerted on the device, noted Cochrane. “But what will be interesting is to see how sensitive the energy output is related to that frequency or the wind speed. Do they need a certain frequency to get any energy out of it? If it’s oscillating below 24 hertz, can it still generate energy?” Additionally, when something flops back and forward, you get fatigue in the materials – so how long these devices last would be interesting to see, he said. “And then how does the technology cope with ice, rain, dust and salty wind blown in from the sea? That would be nice to see proven – because that can be a challenge with conventional turbines.” Meanwhile, its makers are dreaming big. They hope to combine it with small electronic devices such as phones, to provide sustainable electric power, and eventually to make the device competitive with traditional wind turbines, where output is heavily dependent on high wind speeds."
"Whale rescuers at one of the world’s largest stranding events on Tasmania’s west coast have now released 88 of the 470 marine mammals into the ocean, with about 20 of those remaining now well enough to be rescued. Vets at the scene in Macquarie Harbour recommended four of the long-finned pilot whales be euthanised. The task was carried out on Thursday morning. About 380 have died since the stranding was discovered on Monday. Rescuers are now focusing efforts on 20 remaining whales. Nic Deka, the coordinator of the rescue from Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, said on Thursday morning that the focus was shifting to gathering hundreds of dead whales strewn across sandbanks, bays and floating in the water. “We think there are around 20 still viable to release from the sandbar [at Fraser Flats],” he said. “It is a complex site and many whales are submerged. It’s difficult to assess which are alive and dead. But we have about 20 that we think have the strength to be released.” Dr Kris Carlyon, a marine conservation program wildlife biologist, said rescuers had tried to release the animals to be euthanised. “These are animals that we have given them a chance and tried release and they haven’t done well and that’s purely down to the situation they’ve found themselves in.” A spokesperson for Tasmania’s Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment said in statement: “Euthanasia is by firearm with a customised ammunition. This is in line with world best practice for euthanising a whale species of this size.” The stranding, near the town of Strahan, is one of the largest ever recorded anywhere in the world and the biggest in Australia’s history. The previous largest stranding, also involving long-finned pilot whales, was at Dunsbrough in Western Australia in 1996 when 320 of the mammals got stuck with only 20 surviving. Deka said the task of gathering up the dead whales had already started. There were concerns the whales would “bloat and float” and then start to drift, creating a navigation hazard in the harbour. “They could also attract predators such as sharks and that’s always a risk. The decomposition could also affect oxygen levels in parts of the harbour.” He said the preference was to tow the animals out into the ocean and, on Thursday afternoon, efforts were underway to stop the dead whales from floating away. Pilot whales vary in weight depending on age and sex but can weigh more than a tonne. A 32-metre barge with a crane attached is due to arrive from the state-owned TasPorts corporation on Monday to help with the operation to dispose of the carcasses. The MV Kulanda, which can carry a 92-tonne load, also has a crane attached. Boats from the harbour’s fish farming industry would also be used, Deka said. About 40 government staff, 20 volunteers mostly from the harbour’s fish farming industry, and about 17 surf lifesavers have made up the rescue crew. Deka said volunteers were “doing some hard yakka” in the water and everyone was tired, but were “bearing up well under the pressure”. “My focus is on doing the best job we can. Now it’s looking ahead to collect and dispose of the carcasses.” Carlyon said it was unlikely they would ever know for sure why the 470 whales made their way into the shallow water and into the harbour. “The most likely scenario is that something has brought them close to the coast – and most likely that’s food – and then they’ve got themselves into trouble.” The largest known whale stranding was in 1918 in New Zealand’s Chatham Island when about 1,000 pilot whales stranded. Pilot whales, which can live up to 40 years, have a strong social bond and travel in groups, with some staying in the same pod for life. Pods can be up to 1,000 strong."
"Once the sun has set, there’s a chill in the air, but it’s still mild enough to leave my bedroom windows wide open at night. As soon as I switch on the lights, the glow acts as an irresistible invitation to every passing crane fly, moth, mosquito and midge, though they aren’t the only winged insects to be lured towards the light source – a phenomenon known as positive phototaxis. It’s the slight iridescence of its translucent, reticulated wings that first draws my eye to the creature clinging to my ceiling lampshade. Climbing up on my bed for a closer look, I discover it’s a common green lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea). Just 1.5cm in length, it has a slender, pale pistachio-green body, long thread-like antennae and oversized eyes the colour of burnished copper. Most lacewings perish after breeding, the next generation passing the bleakest months as dormant pupae in cocoons buried beneath undisturbed soil, but of the 43 species found in the UK, Chrysoperla carnea is unique, the only one of its kind to overwinter in adult form. Its name is something of a misnomer as, in synchrony with the turning of deciduous trees to shades of red, gold and brown, these insects fade from vibrant lime to dull straw-yellow or pinkish-beige, reverting to green the following spring. This seasonal colour-change is likely an enhancement of crypsis, allowing them to avoid detection by potential predators while hibernating in decomposing leaf litter. Perhaps because many gardeners take their tidying too far – eradicating the hollow plant stems, fallen leaves and log piles that provide natural nooks and crannies in which to hide – lacewings often find refuge in houses and outbuildings. Last autumn one cosied up in a crevice in my kitchen window frame, lying torpid until April when it emerged in search of a mate. It’s possible to purchase purpose-built lacewing “hotels”, but this year I’ve made a shelter from an empty plastic bottle stuffed with a roll of corrugated cardboard. My motives aren’t entirely altruistic. I’ve hung it from a branch of my Victoria plum in the hope that, come spring, the residents will lay eggs and, once hatched, their voracious larvae – colloquially known as aphid lions – will devour the inevitable infestation of sap-suckers."
"Rio Tinto wrote to the Morrison government last year urging it to act quickly to transfer environmental approval powers to the Western Australia government, before a major review of national environment laws was complete. The move came 10 months before the Coalition announced it planned to change the laws to set up “one-stop shops” at state level for environmental approvals, starting with Western Australia. The legislation was introduced in August when the review of the laws, by former competition watchdog Graeme Samuel, was still under way. Rio urged the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, to consider a bilateral approval agreement between the two governments “as a matter of priority”, according to a letter obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws. The mining giant also had meetings with government officials on at least four occasions dating back to August 2019 at which reform of Australia’s environmental laws was discussed. The letter was written by Rio’s then-iron ore chief, Chris Salisbury, one of the executives who stepped down after the company blew up a 46,000-year-old Indigenous heritage site in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. The letter refers to iron ore operations in that same region. In the 21 November 2019 letter, Salisbury said “duplicative” state and federal processes were causing delays and increased costs for the resources sector. He welcomed a speech by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, a day before, signalling the government’s desire to further streamline environmental approvals. “For the reasons set out below, I would respectfully ask that the commonwealth consider as a matter of priority an approval bilateral agreement between the commonwealth and Western Australian governments,” Salisbury wrote. The letter goes on: “We do not consider the review of the EPBC Act needs to occur before such an agreement is entered into.” Salisbury wrote that although the statutory review was under way, national laws already provided a mechanism for the transfer of approval powers to states. He told Ley that WA’s environmental processes were “robust” and a deal between the federal and state governments would save costs and time for industry “without compromising environmental regulation”. Salisbury told Ley he had recently written to and met with the WA premier, Mark McGowan, about the same issue. Answers given to a Senate committee show federal environment officials had four meetings with Rio Tinto – on 27 August and 11 December 2019 and 6 March and 3 April 2020 – at which a bilateral approval agreement or reform of Australia’s environment laws were discussed. In July this year, on the day of the release of the interim report from the EPBC Act review, Ley announced the government would put a streamlining bill to parliament. But officials were instructed to begin drafting the bill 11 days before the review’s chair, Graeme Samuel, delivered his report. Rio Tinto’s iron ore projects were on a list of major projects the government announced in June would be “fast-tracked” and WA was the first state to signal it would pursue a bilateral approval agreement. Both governments said formal negotiations began in August. An environment department spokesman said the minister was not present at meetings its officials had with Rio Tinto and the company’s representations “did not play a role” in the bill before the parliament. Asked if the minister had further meetings with the company, a spokesman for Ley said: “The minister routinely meets with a broad range of stakeholders.” He added that the bill “reflects the interim findings of the Samuel review”. A spokesman for Rio Tinto said the company would not comment about meetings it had with government and declined to respond to a series of questions. He pointed Guardian Australia to the company’s April 2020 submission to the EPBC Act review and an October 2019 submission to a Productivity Commission inquiry which showed the company’s publicly-stated support for bilateral approval agreements. But Tim Beshara, the federal policy director of the Wilderness Society, said the company was “forum-shopping” for sign-off for its mines with the “lowest possible protections in place and before any independent review might suggest the protections are increased”. “When Rio Tinto is the one who gets to set the bar for what is acceptable damage to Australia’s natural and cultural heritage, we all lose,” he said. “It’s unconscionable that the Australian government, before, during and after the demolition of Juukan Gorge could be actively facilitating Rio Tinto’s future work program to go ahead with even lower standards than they are required to meet today.” Samuel’s interim report found Australia’s environment is in unsustainable decline and governments have failed to protect the country’s unique wildlife and habitats. His final report is due at the end of October. Conservationists have warned that the reforms the government is proposing would weaken already unsatisfactory protections. A spokeswoman for McGowan confirmed the premier received Rio Tinto’s letter but did not answer questions about meetings with the company. On 27 November last year, McGowan called for a bilateral approval agreement with the federal government. The spokeswoman said an agreement was being drafted and was expected to result in a “six-month reduction in decision-making timeframes without compromising environmental standards”. “Many industry stakeholders have been pushing for this for a longtime and we’re pleased it’s in train,” she said."
"When the chorus stopped, one voice kept going. On and on, through the dog days of summer and into autumn, it sang with monotonous intent. It was still singing that morning. The breeding season was over, but nobody had told the wood pigeons to stop. Proof of their enduring fecundity was perched on the back of a garden chair. A messy fledgling wore its adolescence in sprigs of pin feathers sprouting out of its head, shoulders, breast and flanks as if it had come out of the nest via a tumble dryer. This young wood pigeon bore a striking in-your-face family resemblance, not so much to its parents as to a distant cousin that shared its big, hook-tipped beak, a horny upper mandible swollen over its nostrils. Perched three metres away, staring at us without any apparent fear or desire for flight, here was a 21st-century dodo. Innocence and naivety are not the best attributes towards a long life, but this youngster was learning life lessons by the minute. It evidently decided it wanted to turn around on its perch for a different view. Raising a hopeful right foot, it twirled its extended claw, stretching to effect a 180-degree turn of its toes, pawing its stubby digits at the top of the chair. But something wasn’t quite working. The bird lowered its head, baffled by the obdurate immobility of a standing leg that was failing to pirouette. The right foot dropped, the left foot rose; it made no difference. While the hapless wood pigeon was trying the can-can’t, we had walked up to almost within arm’s length. Still, those beautiful, muddy blue-grey eyes looked back at us in pigeon-blank ignorance. For its own sake, and as a kindness, it was time to teach this bird to be more wary. My wife, Sarah, hissed sharply and reached out as if to touch it. The pigeon gave a startled leap and flapped in a careening flightpath towards the top of the shed. Its toes touched down on the rim, its body pitched forward, and it scrambled up to the apex, running like a hunched chicken. The pigeon squatted, reflecting perhaps on its narrow escape, one step away from being dead as a dodo."
"About 380 pilot whales were confirmed dead in Tasmania’s west on Wednesday afternoon with rescuers fighting to save the remaining 30 that are still alive. More than 450 long-finned pilot whales were caught on sandbanks and beaches inside Macquarie Harbour, with a rescue effort starting on Tuesday morning. Some 50 whales have been rescued and coaxed back to the open ocean. Rescuers were focused on 270 whales stranded near the town of Strahan, but on Wednesday morning a further 200 whales about 10km away in the same harbour were discovered from a helicopter. Officials later confirmed all had died. The stranding is likely one of the largest on record globally and is the worst in Australia’s history. Nic Deka, the coordinator of the rescue from Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, said they were fighting to save the remaining 30 whales but focus was now turning to retrieval and disposal of the dead whales. “We will try and rescue as many of the remaining live animals as we can.” Dr Kris Carlyon, a marine conservation program wildlife biologist, said on Wednesday that the addition of 200 whales made this current stranding the largest in Tasmania’s history. Records show some 294 whales, also long-finned pilots, stranded at Stanley on Tasmania’s north-west in 1935. About 60 rescuers led by the Tasmanian government’s Marine Conservation Program entered the second day of the rescue on Wednesday focused on an area called Fraser Flats. About 25 whales were lifted off sandbanks and pulled by boat to open waters on Tuesday, but two had returned to the main stranded pod. A further 25 were rescued on Wednesday. Deka said the new group of 200 dead whales were in two bays between 7km to 10km south of the main rescue site. They appear to have gone undetected and likely entered the harbour about the same time as the others. The harbour is about 35km long and about 8km wide. Deka said: “From the air, most appear to be dead.” Asked why they hadn’t been seen before, he said: “The water is a very dark tanin colour and maybe they stranded and then washed back in to the bay. From the air they did not look to be in any condition for rescue.” He said even if those 200 whales had been seen late Monday when the group to the north was discovered, it was unlikely that it would have changed their strategy. When the first 270 whales were discovered, about 90 were estimated to be already dead. “We would still have focused our efforts on Fraser Flats because they are the ones with the best chance of survival.” On Tuesday, Deka told Guardian Australia that two methods were being considered. Burying the whales in a landfill was one, or towing them out into open water and using ocean currents to keep them offshore was another. “We do know we can’t leave them in the harbour because they will present a range of issues. We are committed to retrieving and disposing.” About 40 government staff and 20 volunteers, mostly from the harbour’s fish farming industry, are in chest-deep in water and manoeuvring large webbing under the whales and lifting them off the sand. About 17 surf lifesavers with six inflatables and a jet rescue boat joined the efforts throughout Tuesday. Tags are attached to the rescued whales to monitor them. Pilot whales are very social and need to be taken far enough away from the main group that they don’t turn around and go back. Deka said it was disappointing that two whales saved on Tuesday had returned to the stranding site, “but the majority of the whales [we saved] are still out in deep water and are still swimming. We have been more successful than not.” Carlyon said: “There’s nothing to indicate that this [stranding] is human caused. This is a natural event and we know strandings have occurred before and we know that from the fossil record. “As far as being able to prevent this occurring, there’s little we can do.” Even though Carlyon said the event was natural, there was a public expectation that the survivors should be helped. Euthanising some animals was an option, he said, but it was not a simple practice and at this stage it was not being considered. “We think we have a chance with the animals that are still alive.” Dr Karen Stockin, an associate professor at Massey University in New Zealand, is an expert on whale and dolphin strandings globally and is on an International Whaling Commission expert panel on the issue. She said the Macquarie Harbour stranding was likely Australia’s largest ever. “It’s fair to say this will probably rank third or fourth globally [in terms of the numbers of stranded animals].” Long-finned pilot whales, which can live for up to 40 years, were notorious for large strandings, Stockin said, because of the way they stick together in tight social structures. “Some will remain within their pods their entire lifetime,” she said. In a statement sent to the Guardian, Australia’s environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: “It is heartbreaking to see these stranded whales in Tassie. I want to thank the hard working rescuers and all the amazing volunteers on the ground.” She said the Tasmanian government was leading the rescue, but the federal government had also offered support."
"On winter nights for the past six years, a group of 20 people have rustled through dark, coniferous woods to emerge on a Canadian beach at the lowest possible tide, illuminated by a correspondingly full moon. An elder offers a greeting to the place and a prayer, then the team of researchers, volunteers, and First Nations “knowledge holders” lights a warming fire and begins its work. At sites outlined by stones placed hundreds or even thousands of years ago, some begin raking, or “fluffing”, the top three inches of the beach, loosening rocks and mud - and a remarkable number of old clam shells. When the tide comes back in, it will flush out any rotting organic matter, changing “some places that are compact and smelly into a good clam beach again”, says Skye Augustine, a member of the Stz’uminus First Nation. This spot was once a clam garden, an ancient indigenous form of mariculture that coastal First Nations people have used for millennia. It is estimated that they once numbered in the thousands along the Pacific north-western coast, though ruins are all that’s left of most. In collaboration with the W̱SÁNEĆ and Hul’q’umi’num nations, Augustine has spearheaded the first formal clam garden rehabilitations at two sites in the Gulf Islands, in British Columbia, with dozens more to follow. “My elders articulated to me that if we want to bring our beaches back to life again, we need to bring people back on to them to care for them as they have been cared for in the past. That became my inspiration for my education and career,” she says. “How do we make this clam garden thing happen?” For millennia pre-colonization, clam gardens epitomized sustainable food security for Pacific north-western coastal nations from northern Washington to south-eastern Alaska. Modern studies have found that clam gardens have historically been up to 300% more productive than unmodified beaches, that their clams grew larger and faster than average, and that the clams did not exhibit any signs of resource stress from over-harvesting. To create the beaches, indigenous people built rock walls parallel to a beach’s low tide line, which would trap sediment and flatten the slope of the shore. With continuing tending, such as tilling to improve aeration and the removal of predators like sea stars, these gardens increase or create habitat for butter, littleneck, and horse clams, as well as crabs, chitons, seaweeds, and other useful species. Recent carbon dating has revealed that the oldest clam garden known to science was built about 3,500 years ago. This runs counter to misconceptions that prevailed during colonial settlement of Canada – that First Nations peoples were foragers without established agricultural practices. Such ideas were used as justification for damaging policies that displaced communities from their ancestral lands and criminalized traditional practices. “It has always been our duty to be the stewards of the land,” says group member Nicole Norris, a knowledge holder for the Hul’q’umi’num and an aquaculture specialist. “It is the exact same land my ancestors walked, and all we are doing is completing the work that they started.” One day, Norris anticipates bringing younger generations of her family to these beaches to harvest again. “From the work that we’ve done, we’ve seen the greater ecosystem return – some of the people who live in the local communities have talked about the return of certain birds and plants, and that’s been heartwarming,” she says. In addition to providing food, clam gardens have historically provided the opportunity for “grandparents, aunties, and uncles to spend time at the beach with their grandchildren and younger generations, not only teaching about how to tend the environment … but sharing stories, language, spiritual ties to the place,” says Melissa Poe, who specializes in the social and cultural dimensions of ecosystems at the University of Washington. As the British Columbia restoration effort is demonstrating, clam gardens also help to challenge the idea that the only relationship humans can have with nature is a rapacious one. “I think that one of the most important things about restoring these places is that it requires that we restore people’s relationships with them,” says Augustine. “It forces us to rethink humans as only having negative impacts on our ecosystem, and remember that for millennia we have had really positive and reciprocal relationships with the places we belong to, and we can have those kinds of relationships once again.”"
"Looking across the estuary from the hills above Aberdyfi, the uncertain morning light gave both sea and sky the diffuse grey of long-abandoned pewter. Behind me, the broken slope of the hillside carried an expanse of bracken fronds – colouring now into autumn. Stirred in the sharpening breeze from the east, they fell into patterns echoing the movement of the river surface below me. The tide had just begun to ebb, with streamers of foam starting to build across the mouth of the Afon Dyfi as increasing volumes of water began to sluice energetically seawards. Far to the south the notched cliffs of Ceredigion retreated into the coastal murk, while closer at hand the dunes of Ynyslas defined the southern bank of the Dyfi. Caught in a dynamic balance of erosion and deposition, the pattern of dunes is edged to seaward with a ridge of rounded cobbles – visible as a grey band even from here, a mile or so distant. Beyond the sand dunes the great expanse of Cors Fochno, an impressive raised peat bog with its core still virtually wild, brought further diversity of colour and texture to the landscape. A line of silver, oddly straight in this almost fractal scene, marked the engineered course of the Afon Leri across the edge of the mire. The track across the hillside, edged with gorse flowers and a few late foxgloves, took me down towards the town, finally reached by a half-remembered path dropping between high hedges. The day had begun to warm, burning away the earlier mist and bringing solid colour to the landscape. Inland, the former mere suggestion of high ground resolved into familiar hills, framed by a deepening blue sky and fans of high white cloud. As I headed eastwards towards Machynlleth, sunlight reflected sharply from the choppy waters of the Dyfi, throwing into silhouette a good-sized flock of oystercatchers strung out along the widening foreshore. I lost count at 50, which was perhaps a quarter of the group, and was glad to note that this throng included a number of paler, slightly scruffy, juvenile birds. A healthy presence, but the gathering of flocks in the estuary is a sign of approaching autumn that can no longer be ignored."
"Hundreds of elephants died in Botswana earlier this year from ingesting toxins produced by cyanobacteria, according to government officials who say they will be testing waterholes for algal blooms next rainy season to reduce the risk of another mass die-off. The mysterious death of 350 elephants in the Okavango delta between May and June baffled conservationists, with leading theories suggesting they were killed by a rodent virus known as EMC (encephalomyocarditis) or toxins from algal blooms. “Our latest tests have detected cyanobacterial neurotoxins to be the cause of deaths. These are bacteria found in water,” Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer at the Botswana department of wildlife and national parks, said in a news conference on Monday. “However we have many questions still to be answered such as why the elephants only and why that area only. We have a number of hypotheses we are investigating.” Local sources suggest 70% of elephants died near water holes containing algal blooms, which can produce toxic microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria. Toxins were initially ruled out because no other species died – except for one horse – but scientists now think elephants could be particularly susceptible because they spend a lot of time bathing and drinking large quantities of water. Reuben said the investigation looked at how mortality affected the elephant population and injuries on carcasses, as well as testing water samples at laboratories in Botswana, South Africa and the US. He said the cause was a “combination of neurotoxins” but declined to give further details and declined to say at which institutions tests had been carried out. “I hope that what the government has said is true because it rules out some of the more sinister things,” said Dr Niall McCann, director of conservation at UK-based charity National Park Rescue, who initially suggested the elephants may have been poisoned or died from an unknown pathogen. To test tissue samples they need to be kept in specific conditions and quickly transported to specialised laboratories, but this was not done in Botswana which fuelled speculation about potential causes. “Just because cyanobacteria were found in the water that does not prove that the elephants died from exposure to those toxins. Without good samples from dead elephants, all hypotheses are just that: hypotheses,” said McCann. In July, the government’s official count was 281 deaths but this has now risen to 330 deaths. Reuben said he would be monitoring waterholes for blooms next rainy season to avoid another die-off. “It is important to monitor now to effectively detect the growth of these algal blooms in the water”, he said. Climate change is increasing both the intensity and severity of harmful algal blooms, making this issue more likely to reoccur. McCann confirmed he was working with officials to set up regional early warning systems. Across the border in Zimbabwe, more than 20 dead elephants were found between Hwange national park and Victoria Falls in August, with concerns that the two incidents could be linked. Authorities currently believe this die-off was caused by a bacterial infection. One leading theory is that it was caused by a strain of a bacteria called pasteurella, which killed 200,000 Saiga antelope in Kazakhstan in 2015, says McCann. “There are various options. Thankfully the UK government has collaborated with the government of Zimbabwe to export these samples and now they’re going to be tested in the UK,” he said. If it is something relatively common scientists should be able to detect it. “However, new emerging infectious diseases are happening all the time and the more we look into epidemiology the more we discover we don’t know. So it could be a complete mystery again,” said McCann. A spokesperson from the UK government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said: “Our world-leading scientists are currently running tests on samples sent from Zimbabwe, and will share findings with Zimbabwe Parks as soon as possible.”"
"Decoy eggs made by a 3D-printer and fitted with satellite tags have been placed in sea turtle nests on beaches in Costa Rica to track the illegal trade of their eggs. A quarter of the fake eggs put among 101 turtle nests on four beaches in Costa Rica were stolen, with some eggs successfully tracked as they moved from thief to trafficker to consumer. The egg decoy, dubbed the InvestEggator, was developed by the conservation organisation Paso Pacifico to track the illegal raiding of eggs from nests buried in the sand for trafficking and sale to restaurants, bars and individuals as a delicacy. Researchers found that the decoys did not damage incubating embryos and could successfully track the illegal trade of green and olive ridley turtles eggs and identify trafficking routes, according to a study published in Current Biology. The early evidence suggests that the eggs do not travel far from the beaches where they are snatched. One of the fake eggs was taken close to a nearby residential property, another travelled 2km to a bar, while the farthest-travelled went 137km inland, spending two days in transit. In one case, the discovery of the transmitter-egg led to useful intelligence. Eleven days after the decoy stopped responding in Cariari, a town 43km from the beach, the researchers received photographs, sent from Cariari, of the dissected egg. They also received evidence about where the egg was purchased and how many had been exchanged – useful intelligence for the local authorities seeking to protect the eggs. Helen Pheasey of the University of Kent and lead author of the study said: “Knowing that a high proportion of eggs remain in the local area helps us target our conservation efforts. We can now focus on raising awareness in the local communities and direct law enforcement to this local issue. It also means we know where the consumers are, which assists us in focusing demand reduction campaigns.” According to Pheasey, it is less important to find the people who take the eggs from the beach than identify those who are trafficking and selling the eggs, often door to door, and identifying handover locations. “As trafficking is a more serious crime, those handover points are far more valuable from a law enforcement perspective than catching someone taking a nest,” she said. Not every decoy was successful at deceiving the thieves. Six fake eggs were recovered on the beach, suggesting they had been swiftly discovered and discarded by collectors. Out of the decoys that remained in untouched nests, 32% failed, probably because moisture penetrated the seals and damaged the transmitter. Although the decoys were set to transmit every hour, some also failed to transmit because they were moved to areas where they could not obtain a signal. Researchers said this would improve as infrastructure developed on the Caribbean coast. The decoys were designed by Kim Williams-Guillén for Paso Pacifico after she was inspired by the tracking devices used to monitor drug dealing in Breaking Bad and The Wire. She said: “In one episode of The Wire, two police officers plant an audio device in a tennis ball to surreptitiously record a suspected drug dealer. Turtle eggs basically look like ping-pong balls, and we wanted to know where they were going – put those two ideas together and you have the InvestEggator.” Williams-Guillén said she hoped the technology could be used to protect more turtle populations, as well as potentially be adapted to monitor egg thefts from crocodile and parrot nests, as well as track shipments of shark fins. But she said to eradicate the turtle egg trade it must be part of “a multi-pronged conservation approach that uses education, building better economic opportunities, and enforcement to help fight sea turtle egg-poaching”."
"Around the world, Covid lockdowns have led to improvements in air pollution. In northern India, the Himalayas were visible in the distance for the first time in a generation. And during the first nine weeks of the UK lockdown, nitrogen dioxide along London’s roads decreased by an average of 31% compared with the pre-lockdown period. Non-essential shops in the capital reopened on 15 June but life and traffic pollution have still not returned to normal. Compared with 2019, decreases of more than 40% have been measured along roads in the City of London and Westminster, including the Strand and West End. This builds on the improvements from London’s ultra-low emission zone. But there are emerging signs of a return to pre-lockdown pollution on some suburban roads. The town of Horley, north-east of Gatwick, has recorded a 60% reduction in residential areas close to the airport fence and about 40% in a nearby children’s playground. UK government measurement equipment near Heathrow detected a 46% improvement. The biggest reduction was 64%, recorded near the entrance to the Beech Street tunnel, which is closed to diesel and petrol traffic."
"In 1802, when French naturalist François Péron slipped a small, chunky Australian fish into a jar of preservative, little did he suspect that his unassuming prize would be the only member of its species ever known to science. The smooth handfish (Sympterichthys unipennis) was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List earlier this year. This strange and spiny bottom-dweller made history with its passing. It became the first marine bony fish to be listed as extinct in modern times. Today, all that remains of the species is that discoloured specimen in the Natural History Museum in Paris. Scooped up off the coast of south-east Tasmania, Péron’s catch was one of the 14 handfish species living in southern Australian waters at the time. The relatives of the smooth handfish are a colourful family which crawl around the seafloor using adapted fins as “hands”. They look like grumpy ageing punks, each sporting a dorsal fin over its head like a mohawk, bulging eyes and a cantankerous expression. As a family, they have a lot to be grumpy about. Since colonisation, human activity has caused their numbers to plummet. Seven species have not been seen for more than 20 years and three Tasmanian species, the spotted, red and Ziebell’s handfish, are listed as critically endangered. “The smooth handfish must have been relatively common to be among the first species collected on the continent,” says Prof Graham Edgar, a marine biologist at the University of Tasmania, whose work contributed to the IUCN listing. With no living specimens to study, Edgar and his colleagues have had to infer much of what we know about the species from Péron’s records. Péron was on board the Géographe, a vessel fitted out for research that was captained by Nicolas Baudin and sent to the southern continent by Napoleon. Collection methods were limited to lines, shallow water dip nets and seine nets. “No handfish has ever been caught by line,” explains Edgar, meaning the fish was most likely to have been caught with a seine or dip net, suggesting it was a shallow water species. If smooth handfish were so plentiful that Péron could easily scoop one up in his net, why did they disappear? “It’s not possible to single out this or that particular cause,” says Edgar. However, he believes that historical dredging for scallops and oysters, sediment runoff from industry and climate change are the most likely causes for the extinction. Local ecosystems have been dramatically degraded by these factors. “About 40% of shallow reef species in southern Tasmania are showing rapid population decline, the whole marine system in the south-east has changed substantially in the last 100 years,” he says. With sea temperatures increasing at about four times the global average, climate change is hitting south-east Tasmania hard. This has created what Edgar describes as a “climate trap” for coastal marine life. As warm water moves south, species that require cold, shallow water are losing habitat. “The loss of the smooth handfish is potentially part of a much bigger issue, as a large number of other species have dwindling populations and are heading towards extinction in this cold temperate location.” Extinctions are often caused by cumulative factors, agrees Dr Tim Lynch, former chair of the National Handfish Recovery Team (NHRT) and a senior researcher at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. When musing on the smooth handfish, he points to the destruction of the shellfish reefs which were once a dominant feature of south-east Tasmanian seas. These reefs were ripped apart by a rapacious oyster and scallop dredging operation in the early 20th century. The catastrophic biodiversity loss witnessed by this region was revealed by comparing core samples taken from these dredging sites. Sediment samples from 1890 show a mean of 21 bivalve species, whereas the 1990 samples contain a mean of seven. The shellfish industry collapsed within decades, but Lynch explains that the reefs’ capacity to recover has been hindered by the northern Pacific sea star (Asterias amurensis) – a ravenous, predatory species, introduced via ship ballast to southern waters. “That’s the habitat that the soft sediment species of handfish would have thrived in, but it’s gone now,” Lynch says. Although the smooth handfish had not being sighted for more than 200 years, it took Edgar, Lynch and their colleagues decades of doggedly surveying the marine diversity of southern Australia before they were confident beyond reasonable doubt it was extinct. Until recently there was always the slight hope that there might be a remnant population or individuals clinging to survival. “If the smooth handfish were a mammal, bird, reptile or plant it would have been listed as extinct years ago. Because it was a marine species there’s always been that element of doubt,” Edgar says. The last smooth handfish probably perished decades before the species was declared extinct, which raises the question: have other marine fish gone extinct without us knowing? “Almost certainly,” says Lynch. “The likelihood that [species] have not come to the notice of western science before they have become extinct is quite high.” This is because marine biodiversity is so broad, and surveying the sea is a harder task. He emphasises that marine plants and invertebrates might also be in more trouble than records such as the Red List suggest. Edgar agrees that a lack of data might be veiling the true extent of biodiversity loss in the ocean. He points to more thoroughly researched marine life such as corals, sharks and groupers. He says: “When you look at these groups the number of threatened species is actually similar in the sea to on land.” The underrepresentation of marine fish on the Red List has led to the comfortable assumption that marine fish are in less trouble than their terrestrial and freshwater counterparts. The landmark listing of the smooth handfish as extinct shows us that the ocean is not too vast to be touched by the extinction crisis.

"A Guardian Country Diarist for 23 years, my friend Sarah Poyntz was inspired and sustained by the beauty of the Burren in County Clare, Ireland, where she made her home in the 1980s. Curiously, in a limestone area renowned for its vast range of rare Arctic-alpine plants, Sarah, who has died from cancer aged 93, was a galanthophile – her favourite flower was the humble snowdrop. When she moved to live in the Burren in 1986, she wrote to the Guardian asking if the paper would like some contributions. The editor of the section warned her not to hold out much hope since 300 people were on a waiting list to write a column. Undaunted, she began in 1987 and continued with a regular diary – the sole Irish contributor – until 2010. Sarah was born in New Ross, County Wexford, where her parents, Frank and Nellie (nee Murphy), both worked in a local law firm. She was educated at Loreto Abbey school in Gorey and University College Dublin, graduating with an arts degree before becoming a teacher and moving to England. There she taught at Callington grammar school in Cornwall and was later appointed head of the English department at the Perse school for girls in Cambridge, before spending a number of years travelling first in the US and then in France. On one occasion, in the early 60s, her love of France led her to spend an afternoon sharing a bottle of wine with Samuel Beckett in Paris. She had written to him asking if they could meet, and he sent a postcard arranging a rendezvous. The Burren, though, was Sarah’s adopted home. It was a place that held a bewitching appeal for her, not just because of the flora, but because of the wild sea on her doorstep and rapidly changing landscape moods. Evocatively, she documented the thrills of nature, along with stories of the flourishing local community, frequently invoking literary quotations. Field glasses in hand, she roamed the limestone hills as well as the shorefront at her house near Ballyvaughan, delighting in seeing the first spring gentian – the floral emblem of the Burren – or spotting the elusive pine marten. She quartered the ground, searching for mountain avens, twayblade, early purple orchid, geraniums and ferns. Many of her best ideas were found by walking the fields and pavement, stumbling across a dolmen, an ancient ringfort or fulacht fiadh (cooking site). One of her hobbies was building model boats. Sarah’s Guardian diaries were collected in an anthology, A Burren Journal (2000), dedicated to her partner, Mary Ann Radzinowicz, whose father had served as a general in the US Army alongside Eisenhower during the second world war. In 2005 she privately published a memoir of her early days in Wexford, Memory Emancipated, and in 2010 she edited Burren Villages: Tales of History and Imagination. She is survived by Mary Ann."
"Water companies in England were responsible for their worst levels of environmental pollution in five years in 2019, leading to condemnation from ministers and the Environment Agency. In its annual assessment of the nine privatised water and sewerage companies, Emma Howard Boyd, the chair of the EA, said their performance continued to be unacceptable. More investment was needed by several of the companies wich were failing to protect the environment, she said. The environment secretary, George Eustice, and Howard Boyd are summoning the worst performing firms – South West Water, Anglian, Northumbrian and Southern – to a meeting to demand they “step up” and do better. But Nick Measham, of Salmon and Trout Conservation, said it was time for a review into how the industry was run. “This is utterly unacceptable,” said Measham. “The current water industry setup is not working. The companies are being run to maximise returns to their mostly private equity owners with the environment taking second place. A regulatory reset to ensure our rivers get the protection they deserve is essential if government aims for water are to [be] anything [other than] lame platitudes.” The damning assessment of the way water companies treat the environment comes after the poor state of rivers in England was revealed last month. No river in England was found to be in a good overall state, amid concerns over the scale of sewage discharges and agricultural and industrial chemicals entering the water system. The EA performance assessment published on Friday revealed there were 2,204 “pollution events” last year – the highest number since 2014 – marking the worst record for environmental pollution from the water industry for five years. Southern Water was responsible for 458 pollution incidents, nearly double its 2018 total. Serious pollution events that have a major impact on rivers or seas by the water companies have hardly improved, the report says. In 2019, there were 52 category 1 events – the most serious – compared with 56 in 2018, and 48 serious pollution incidents took place at sewerage facilities, more than half of which were from Anglian and Thames Water assets. Only Severn Trent and Wessex Water achieved the highest level of performance, with 4 star ratings from the EA. Howard Boyd said: “We expect much more. This includes developing, publishing and implementing specific plans by the end of this year to reduce pollution incidents. We will closely follow the delivery of these plans and will apply tough regulation to ensure companies stick by them.” Southern Water became the first company to be given a 1 star (poor) rating since 2015, and was one of four companies rated as poor or requiring improvement. It was fined a record £126m last year over “shocking” failures at the company’s sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England. Eustice said: “Water companies have a responsibility to act as custodians of the environment and this report for 2019 shows that some are failing to take their obligations seriously. That is not good enough. Certain water companies must step up and do better, which is why I will be meeting those who are falling short of our expectations to discuss how we can work together to drive better performance.” Howard Boyd defended the action taken by her agency against companies that continued to pollute the environment. In the last five years, she said, the agency had brought 44 prosecutions against water companies, securing fines of £34m. Water companies are being told to implement plans to reduce pollution incidents by the end of the year, as part of an action plan to tackle their unacceptable performance. She pointed to a new storm overflow task force to tackle the scale of raw sewage pollution released by water companies into rivers. The task force was set up after the Guardian revealed that water companies discharged raw sewage from storm overflows more than 200,000 times in 2019. The five-year high for environmental pollution by the water industry comes as analysis shows that the sector has paid out £57bn in dividends since it was privatised 30 years ago. Dave Tickner, chief adviser on freshwater science at WWF-UK, said: “Our own prime minister told the UN it is time to turn words into action to address loss of nature. To do that our government must provide more resources for the Environment Agency so it can do the job the public expects. “It should also demand that the Agency uses these resources to clamp down on polluters. In addition, Ofwat should have a duty, passed on to water companies, to protect river health.” Philip Dunne, the chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Today’s report ... offers a bleak picture of the state of UK water and sewerage companies, and it is deeply alarming that four out of the nine companies assessed require improvement. There seems to be a level of complacency resulting in terribly poor performance. All water companies must crack down on pollution which can be deeply damaging to the natural environment and human health.”"
"Nearly nine out of 10 UK households say they “regularly recycle”, with more prepared to further change their lifestyles to help the environment, research reveals. Statistics released on Monday by the Recycle Now campaign show despite the challenges and restrictions of lockdown, the UK appears to be becoming more environmentally aware. Shortly after the lockdown, 73% of consumers said they were willing to do more to help the environment, up from 68% in 2019. At the same time, 93% of UK households believe “everyone has a responsibility to help towards cleaning up the environment”. Just under one in 10 (9%) admit they recycle only occasionally and one in 25 (4%) “rarely” or “never”. Recycle Now is the government-funded national recycling campaign for England, managed by its waste advisory body Wrap and used by more than 90% of English authorities. The figures are published at the start of the 17th annual Recycle Week from research during lockdown and a bigger survey in July. “It’s fantastic to see that despite everything that has been thrown at them this year, more people than ever in the UK are taking responsibility for the environment by choosing to recycle,” said Peter Maddox, director of Wrap UK. “However, we still have a way to go in terms of correctly identifying what can and cannot be recycled.” On average, UK households dispose of 1.5 items each day that could be recycled in the general rubbish – mainly foil, aerosols and plastic detergent or cleaning bottles. The majority (82%) mistakenly put one or more items in the recycling that are not accepted by local collections, predominantly plastic film/wrapping, toothpaste tubes and glass cookware. Wrap says its own data shows recyclable tonnage surged by a quarter early in lockdown but with the exception of garden waste “most kerbside collections were maintained throughout lockdown”. Separate polling published on Monday reveals the challenges of recycling in densely populated areas, with one in three in Londoners admitting they find recycling information difficult to understand. The findings came from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which will unveil a partnership with Innocent drinks and environmental charity Hubbub to try to boost recycling rates. Households will be urged to help catch “recycling’s most wanted” such as drinks cans, yogurt pots and bathroom plastics, which belong in the recycling, but sometimes manage to escape. Gavin Ellis, co-founder of Hubbub, said: “Lockdown transformed the way we live and work, including our recycling habits and we know from our research that 43% of people are more concerned about plastic pollution than before Covid-19. At a hugely challenging time for local authorities, supporting households to recycle better is more important than ever before.”"
"Red sky at dawn and dusk is part of weather lore and apparently a cause for delight or warning among shepherds and sailors. But, as huge areas of forest burn, the crimson colour of skies over the western US is a red alert for our air pollution and climate emergency. Even in New York and Washington DC the sun turned orange. This is because smoke from wood burning strongly absorbs purple and blue light. Longer wavelengths pass through and the sky takes on shades of red. This curiosity can be useful. In 2005 Swiss scientists noticed that the particle pollution from wood stoves that filled Alpine villages in winter strongly absorbed ultraviolet light, opening a way to routinely measure wood smoke in our air. Smoke from other solid fuels can strongly absorb purple and blue light too. This may explain the colours in the pea-souper smogs that enveloped London up to the 1960s. In 1855, the Times described the November sky as having the changing colours of a bad bruise. Even in 1947, Arnold Marsh wrote of red and yellow smog-filled skies. It is these tricks of the light that inspired Claude Monet’s iconic paintings of the UK Houses of Parliament."
"The Morrison government has said it refused to sign a global pledge endorsed by 64 countries committing them to reverse biodiversity loss because it was inconsistent with Australia’s policies. Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Jacinda Ardern and Boris Johnson are among world leaders who signed the Leaders’ pledge for nature which was launched on Monday ahead of a major UN summit on biodiversity being hosted virtually from New York. The summit is working towards a Paris-style global agreement on nature. The federal government was invited to sign but refused because the 10-point plan calls for commitments that are inconsistent with Australian policy – including a greater ambition to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and reach net zero emissions by 2050. A spokesman for Morrison said: “Australia has already committed to a net zero emissions target by the second half of the century as set out in the Paris agreement.” “We will not agree to other targets unless we can tell the Australian people what they will cost to achieve and how we will achieve it,” he said. The spokesman said “we want to achieve net zero emissions as soon as possible” and pointed to the government’s recently released technology roadmap. Apart from Australia, other countries that didn’t sign the pledge include the United States, Brazil, China, Russia and India. The pledge warns humanity is in a state of “planetary emergency” due to the intertwined crises of biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation and climate change. It states that the decline of the natural world is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. “Nature fundamentally underpins human health, wellbeing and prosperity,” the pledge states. “We need to appropriately value nature and the services it provides as we make decisions and recognise that the business case for biodiversity is compelling.” Australia was recently singled out for mammal extinction in a UN report that found the world had failed to meet a single target to slow the loss of the natural world and preserve land and marine ecosystems. The pledge promises a stronger global effort to reduce deforestation, halt unsustainable fishing practices, eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies and begin the transition to sustainable food production systems and a circular economy during the next decade. Leaders promised to ensure “biodiversity, climate and the environment as a whole” were at the heart of responses to the economic crisis brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Against the backdrop of Covid-19, which has crippled the world’s economies and pressured governments everywhere to begin the process of rebuilding and renewing, decisions made now will have ramifications for all of us and for generations to come,” the pledge states. Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, should explain why Australia would not commit to a stronger effort to protect wildlife. “Australia is in the midst of an extinction crisis, 3 billion animals have died or were displaced by last summer’s bushfires and 12m hectares of land burnt . But the Morrison government doesn’t think we have a problem,” Butler said. The Greens environment spokeswoman, senator Sarah Hanson-Young, said a global target on extinction, similar to the Paris target, was necessary to stem the rapid loss of biodiversity. She said Australia was “squandering an opportunity” to take a leading role after the bushfire crisis, which accelerated the loss of habitat and wildlife and has forced the government to consider new threatened listings for iconic species, including the koala. “Our biodiversity is under significant threat and with it our tourism industry and local economy,” Hanson-Young said. “Australia’s lack of commitment at this summit is shameful and ultimately will be bad for our economy, as well as our environment.” Tim Beshara, federal policy director at the Wilderness Society, said world leaders who visited Australia were immediately introduced to a koala. “If prime minister Morrison isn’t willing to tell the world we are committed to ending species extinction in Australia, what level of extinction is he willing to tell Australians he is happy with?” he said. Sir Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), described the pledge as “outstanding” and praised the links leaders had made between the destruction of the natural world and the sustainable development goals. But Watson cautioned what was possible without the signatures of major polluters. “Many of the most important countries in the world that are causing climate change due to their emissions of greenhouse gases, and/or are destroying their biodiversity, are not signatures to this pledge. Without countries such as the USA, Brazil, China, Russia, India, and Australia we cannot succeed in achieving the Paris climate goal or halting and ultimately reversing the loss of biodiversity,” he said.

"It’s 10am and the hens are getting excited and bustling around. Jo and Charles Mear are approaching the hutches carrying blue crates and the birds, heads popping up, know what’s inside: black soldier fly larvae or maggots. Watching chickens peck around for maggots should be utterly normal. Insects are a natural part of a bird’s diet, but most hens today never see one in their lifetime. Instead, they are kept indoors and fed a grain- and soy-rich diet, typically in the form of pellets. But insects are rich in protein and essential micronutrients. They require less space, produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions and have a high feed conversion rate. And if they could reduce, even in just a small way, the dominance of rainforest-destroying soy as the feed of choice for UK chickens, the benefits could be enormous. “[Soy is] our Achilles heel. It’s the best pound for pound source of protein so it’s hard to convince farmers to move away from it,” says Charles. Scientists at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization certainly believe they can, concluding that insects contain the necessary nutrients, especially protein, to replace between 25–100% of soymeal for chickens. And here, on this chicken farm in Cambridgeshire, an experiment is being carried out that might bring that reality a little closer. The Mears keep around 28,000 birds across two barns in Cambridgeshire, supplying branded free-range eggs to the Co-op, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Tesco. “We’re trying to produce a more sustainable ‘over the hedge’ farm here where we source everything we need as locally as possible. So finding a way to replace soy has been the next step for us,” says Charles.That opportunity presented itself when by chance he heard about two Cambridge graduates who had recently founded the insect startup Better Origin. “With the guys being so close by I just said to them to come and use our farm to trial the insects,” says Charles. In March they began hosting the UK’s first AI-powered insect mini farm in a shipping container unit, growing larvae using food waste. The specialised insect-breeding unit was built off-site and delivered straight to the farm. Batches of maggot eggs arrive every few days, and the insects are reared in an automated setup that tracks their growth using thermal cameras and AI. All Charles and Jo need to do is keep the unit supplied with energy and waste feedstocks. The larvae grow rapidly: “5,000 times its body mass in less than a couple of weeks”, according to Better Origin’s co-founder Fotis Fotiadis, and happily live off food and crop waste. After two weeks they are ready to be fed to the hens, and a new cycle of eggs is delivered to the farm to maintain a continuous supply of insects. The results have been unequivocally positive, say the Mears. The birds – a wonderfully healthy and energetic flock – love it: they’ve worked out the time of the day when blue containers of maggots, rather than ready-made feed, arrive, and get particularly excited when they see them coming. It has also encouraged the hens to carry out natural foraging behaviours, says Charles, who has noticed that as a result they seem less inclined to peck other birds. “Even after the maggots are all gone they carry on looking and stay active doing little scratch dances, which is really healthy for them.” “It also brings a reduction in floor eggs [eggs laid on the floor which are downgraded by retailers and not able to be sold as fresh eggs]. As they are looking for food they don’t feel comfortable laying eggs out and about in the communal areas so go back to their nesting boxes to lay eggs.” “Normally improved welfare outcomes come at a cost to productivity, but that’s not the case with feeding live insects,” says Fotiadis. “This is what chickens have evolved for millions of years to do, hunting and pecking around for their food.” Feeding live insects has also been found to have a positive effect on the birds’ immune systems – the Mears haven’t used antibiotics on their farm this year – offering the potential to reduce antibiotic use, which continues to rise in the poultry sector. For now, the ambition is to replace 5% of the birds’ soy-based diet with insects. And while the welfare and environmental benefits are already clear, the main selling point for farmers is economics, says Fotiadis, who calculates that supplementing diets with live insects can add 80p–£1 per hen of profit per year. “We know there are welfare benefits, but these are hard to monitor. But we can prove to the rest of the farming industry the financial benefit of incorporating insects. It increases productivity (the birds produce more eggs), the quality of the eggs (less floor eggs) and improves feather cover (poor feather cover is linked to the need for more feed). It works for the farmer and makes them more money,” he says. He and his team, who are installing a second insect-rearing unit on a chicken farm in Wales next month, have also tracked a 3% increase in shell strength in the hens’ eggs due to the rich source of calcium provided by the black soldier fly larvae. “This type of larvae is a missing link in the food chain. In nature there is no waste. The apple rots and is either absorbed by the soil or eaten and converted into nutrients by larvae. We take wasted nutrients and put them back into the food chain. It’s closer to nature and a much better way of farming,” says Fotiadis. Back on the farm, Charles Mear can’t get enough of seeing how much his hens are enjoying the insects. “Psychologically, the hen always wants to go out and scratch about to loosen the soil and look for grub. I just love coming and seeing them itching to get out of the shed and look for it [the larvae] now they know it is going to be there.”Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"He might not have had the best homing instincts. But a New Zealand native pigeon – or kererū – named Pidge made it back, eventually, to the place of his hatching after 24 years missing in the wild.  Pidge, who was hand-reared at Rainbow Springs – a wildlife and nature park in Rotorua, on New Zealand’s North Island – disappeared in 1996 and was not seen again before his return in August. That would make the bird, identified by a numbered band on his leg, 29 years old; most references list kererū lifespans as between 15 and 25 years. “To have Pidge up there almost 30, older than some of the keeping staff, was really exciting,” said Emma Bean, the kiwi hatchery manager for the park. He is likely to be the oldest living kererū, she added. The park is investigating reports that a slightly older bird might have lived at Hamilton Zoo and has since died. The kererū – which triumphed in 2018 New Zealand’s Bird of the Year contest – has a distinctive white feather apron and noisy wingbeats. They are known for their drunk, gluttonous nature – occasionally falling out of trees after an over-consumption of berries – and generously rounded shape. But Pidge was “skinny” and in poor condition when a keeper found him on the grounds of the National Hatchery at Rainbow Springs, Bean said. The park had kept his return a secret until they knew he was “doing all right,” and he had spent a month feasting on grapes and bananas. “He’s starting to show signs that he wants to fly, so we’ll be moving him into the aviary this week,” she said. Records did not show whether Pidge had absconded from the park in 1996 or was released, but keepers assume he had lived nearby and returned for “a bit of TLC in his retirement years” when feeding became a struggle, Bean said. An 88-year-old trout keeper and another long-time staff member remembered Pidge from the early 1990s and were “delighted” by his return which came at a rocky time, just before the park was able to reopen after New Zealand’s Covid-19 lockdown. International tourists have been barred from entering the country, and the park was forced to lay off some staff before receiving a one-off shot of government relief funds this month to cover operating costs. “It just syncs in really nicely with the fact that Pidge was hatched and raised here and has come home to roost,” said Bean. He had also returned home close to New Zealand’s annual kererū census, a citizen science project to find out how many of the birds remain. They are not considered an endangered species but numbers have fallen in recent decades. One mystery of Pidge’s homecoming remains: kererū are often seen in pairs and it is unknown whether he left behind a girlfriend when he returned to the park. Once Pidge moved to the aviary, keepers would look out for a bird watching him from outside, Bean said. “If he does have a partner out there I’m sure she’ll find him,” she said. “It’s only been a month … I hope she hasn’t moved on too quickly.”"
"Farmers need more support from the government to plant the trees necessary to meet the UK’s climate targets, ministers have been told, as they consider wide-ranging changes to farming payments after Brexit. Tree-planting is expensive, difficult and requires patience as the trees take years or even decades to yield commercial returns. Farmers and green campaigners are concerned that they will be left out of government plans to bring in a new interim subsidy system – called the sustainable farming incentive – to tide farmers over between the end of European subsidies this year, and the phasing in of new environmental land management contracts in 2027. The Soil Association is calling for clarity on how the sustainable farming incentive will encourage tree-planting, and also urging the government to include agroforestry – where trees are grown among or alongside crops, rather than in separate plantations – in its plans.  Most of the UK’s tree strategy is focused on planting new forests, or extending existing woodlands. But where trees can be planted alongside crops, they provide additional benefits such as more wildlife habitats, reduced water use and better carbon dioxide retention in the soil. Ben Raskin, head of horticulture and agroforestry at the Soil Association, said: “Planting more trees on farms can be a win-win for climate, nature and health, and would support the huge ambition of the government’s national tree strategy.  “It seems a no-brainer for the government to provide a supportive policy framework and more clarity on payments, to increase the uptake of agroforestry.” Tree-planting rates have fallen behind government goals, but if the UK is to meet its long-term aim of net zero emissions by 2050, about 1.5bn new trees will be needed, according to the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisers. Only 13% of the UK’s land area is made up of woodland, far below the European average of about 38%. David Wolfe and his brother manage Wakelyns, a 22.7-hectare (56-acre) farm in Suffolk planted by his parents in 1994 as an example of how agroforestry can work. Crops including wheat, lentils and squash are planted in north-south alleys with trees between them.  Harvesting among the trees is made easy by the alley layout, and the trees stop soil erosion, help retain water in the soil and provide a habitat for wildlife. They also constitute a crop in themselves, including cherries, walnuts, figs and apricots, as well as trees for timber and coppiced willow and hazel for thatching, fencing and fuel. Wolfe is concerned that the government will provide incentives for farmers to plant new trees but leave out farms such as Wakelyns that have long grown trees. “Most incentive schemes are for farmers to change what they’re planting, but where you already have changed practices, you need support to maintain them,” he said. Planting the right trees on farms could boost farm productivity by about 30%, according to Soil Association estimates, as well as capturing carbon dioxide, improving soil health and providing improved habitats for wild plants, insects, birds and other wildlife. The group conducted a survey of 346 farmers that found many would be interested in growing more trees, but felt there was not enough support from the government. Andy Dibben, head grower at the 600-hectare Abbey Home Farm in Gloucestershire, started planting trees among his 6 hectares of organic vegetables three years ago. His aim is for the trees to provide shelter from the wind and protect against soil erosion, as well as a habitat for insects, birds and small mammals that keep down pests, instead of resorting to pesticides. He warned that ongoing support is needed to help farmers growing trees. “There’s a lot of talk about mass tree-planting, but the question is, how many of those trees will survive to full maturity? They need to be managed over years to get the full benefits,” he said. Tom Fairfax, who runs a mixed farm, the Mindrum Partnership on the Cheviots in Northumberland, said: “Government policy on agroforestry is often incoherent when applied in context – I recently discovered that, like many landowners, I have been implementing agroforestry for over 50 years without realising it. I’ve implemented much of my agroforestry in spite of, rather than because of, government policy.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The environmental land management scheme will create cleaner, greener landscapes, helping build towards the government’s tree planting goals and net zero commitments.  “We have been working closely with farmers and land managers to consider how agroforestry can fit into the new scheme, and how we can reward them for an array of environmental work, such as planting and maintaining trees.”"
"Despite a warm and sunny British summer, fewer butterflies than ever were recorded in each count by the biggest butterfly survey in the world. Record numbers of people took part in the Big Butterfly Count in July and August, with nearly 150,000 15-minute counts of butterflies taking place in parks, gardens, woods and nature reserves across the country. But the Butterfly Conservation survey reported the lowest average number of butterflies per count – 10.66 – since recording began in 2010. “Unfortunately, this summer has not seen an abundance of butterflies across the UK,” said Dr Zoë Randle, the senior surveys officer at Butterfly Conservation. “Coming so shortly after the recent WWF and UN reports on the global biodiversity crisis these 2020 results illustrate the perilous state of wildlife in the UK.” But the low numbers – down 34% on 2019 and worse than the dire wet summer of 2012 – may not be as bad as they appear because a record-breaking sunny spring caused many butterfly species to emerge earlier and complete their adult lifecycle before the count began on 17 July. The record number of 111,628 participants, a big increase on 2019, may also have included novice spotters who recorded fewer butterflies than regulars. Randle said: “An unusually warm spring led many species to emerge earlier than usual. So we may have only caught the tail-end of the flight period for many species during this year’s Big Butterfly Count. Our scientists will use the data to try and understand what is happening and how we can work to solve it.” The two most-seen species in the 2020 count, the large white and the small white, are typically seen in highest number at summer’s end. Big falls in the numbers of peacocks (down 42% on 2019) and small tortoiseshells (down 41%) may have been because these species had already entered into hibernation by the end of July. This year’s count recorded the highest number of butterfly sightings ever submitted, with a record number of participants, counts and overall butterflies seen, with 1.4m common species spotted. Randle added: “The fact that so many people take part in this exciting citizen science initiative is encouraging and makes a huge difference to our understanding of how the natural world is responding to the crisis it is in. Now we need to see initiatives both here and across the world to put nature on a path to recovery.” The Big Butterfly Count results are used to gather a picture of how flying insects are faring in Britain alongside a more scientific survey, the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, the longest-running scientific database of butterfly records in the world. Three-quarters of Britain’s 59 native butterflies are in decline and, while global heating is helping some species expand, common species continue to disappear from towns and countryside. From 1976, when scientific recording began, populations of “habitat specialists” – butterflies requiring specific places to survive such as chalk grassland or coppice woodland – fell by 59% by 2019. But within that decline, between 2014 and 2019 habitat specialists increased from 37% to 41% of their 1976 levels. Such figures recently published by the government suggest targeted conservation action has helped revive rare species. 1. Large white (+44%)2. Small white (+7%)3. Gatekeeper (-14%)4. Peacock (-42%)5.

"Britain’s oil and gas rigs are the most polluting in the North Sea oil basin, according to industry data, with enough unwanted gas burned off every year to heat a million homes. Oil rigs in the UK continental shelf (UKCS) released 13.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere last year, according to data from Rystad Energy, significantly more than those from the Norwegian and Danish regions of the North Sea, which produced 10.4m tonnes and 1.4m tonnes of CO2 respectively in the same year. The report found that oil rigs in UK waters released 3m tonnes of carbon through routine “flaring” of unwanted gas totalling billions of cubic feet. Another 10.1m tonnes of CO2 were released in large part because the industry regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), continues to allow oil producers to run their rigs on fossil fuels, according to Rystad. These figures suggest that the UK emits 21kg of carbon dioxide for every barrel of North Sea oil produced, compared to only 8kg of CO2 in Norway, where oil producers run their rigs on renewable energy. This could hold serious implications for the UK’s carbon targets if oil production from the UKCS is allowed to rebound by 25% in the 2030s in line with forecasts by Rystad. The figures have emerged eight years after the World Bank warned nations that global gas flaring contributes as much to climate crisis as a major economy such as Italy. Olga Savenkova, an analyst at Rystad Energy, said there is “significant room for improvement” in cutting the carbon intensity of the UK’s oil industry, including plans to run oil rigs in the UKCS on clean energy rather than fossil fuels. Hedvig Ljungerud, the OGA’s director of strategy, said on Monday that the regulator was “looking to take a robust stance on flaring”, which is carried out with consent from the OGA, only weeks after it had outlined plans to call for the industry to run their rigs on power generated by nearby wind turbines. The OGA was originally set up in the wake of the 2015 oil market crash with the mission to “maximise” oil and gas production from the UK’s ageing North Sea industry but it is now under pressure to reduce emissions, too after the UK set a legally binding goal to cut emissions to virtually zero by 2050. “We believe there are clear opportunities for industry to go further to advance cleaner production,” Ljungerud said."
"My friend Barry Rydz, who has died aged 98, was a civil engineer who concentrated most of his efforts on trying to improve the UK’s water infrastructure. He was born in Salford, Manchester, to Reuben Rydz, a proofreader on the Manchester Guardian, and Matilda (nee Lister), a teacher. His mother died when he was three, and so Barry and his older brother, David, were brought up by a maternal aunt, Kate Lister. After attending Central High school in Manchester and then the Manchester College of Technology, during the second world war Barry joined the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and, having gained a good grounding in engineering as a result, afterwards got a job with ICI in 1947. That move marked the beginning of a distinguished civil engineering career: his 12 years with ICI, during which he focused on the modelling of water resources, were followed by five years with Binnie and Partners (1960-65), a firm of consulting engineers. My brother Max was employed there, and it was through him that Barry and I met. After working for Binnie and Partners on the Johore river supply to Singapore and the spillway design of the Mangla Dam in Pakistan, Barry spent nine years (1965-74) as the senior engineer and assistant director of the Water Resources Board, where he was responsible for developing an integrated water plan for England and Wales. Finally he was director of resource planning with the Severn Trent Water Authority. He retired in his 50s, frustrated by the fact that his radical plans for meeting future increases in water demand were thwarted by the government. After retirement he increased his involvement and support for the Liberal (later Liberal Democrat) party. He was a one-time vice-chairman of the Chippenham Liberal party, chairman of its sub-branch in Box in the Cotswolds, where he lived for 57 years, and a parish councillor in Box from 1979 to 1987, in which role he was involved in the restoration of the nearby Box railway tunnel, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. He also founded the Box-based charity the Gambia Connection.  Barry loved classical music and was passionate about gardening, especially in “the jungle” he created at his home. He never married, and in his later years he became progressively more reliant on his long-term friend Alpha Baldeh, who cared for him with great dedication."
"Homeowners in England can apply for vouchers worth up to £10,000 to make their homes more energy efficient through the government’s Green Homes Grant scheme, which opened this week. In most cases it will pay two-thirds of the cost of the energy efficient improvements, up to a maximum of £5,000 a household – but if you’re on a low income and on certain benefits you can claim the entire cost up to £10,000. The government has said the work must completed by 31 March 2021, which may prove a testing timeframe. To get the free money you have to commit to installing what the scheme calls a “primary” measure. This could be solid wall, cavity wall, underfloor, loft or roof insulation, or low-carbon heating, such as air-source or ground-source heat pumps, a biomass boiler or a solar thermal system. Experts predict more applications for heat-based measures but it is early days. Once that work is done you can also apply for vouchers to cover a number of “secondary” measures. These include double or triple glazing, energy-efficient doors or smart heating controls. Smart controls look likely to be the most popular secondary measure, which also includes the installation of thermostatic radiator valves. If you home needs cavity wall and floor insulation costing £6,000, you will only pay £2,000, with the government vouchers contributing the remaining two-thirds. Agree to install an £10,000 air-source heat pump and the government will contribute the first £5,000 – or the whole amount if you are on benefits including working tax credit, child tax credit, universal credit and disability living allowance. To apply you must have received at least one quote from a Green Homes Grant-registered installer. If the price seems unreasonably high, the scheme administrator may request that you provide another quote. If your application is successful, you will be sent a voucher to give to the tradesperson carrying out the work. You can get the vouchers, you must own a home in England. Eligible properties include park homes, those on long leaseholds and shared ownership. Landlords can also apply. While some people will want to spend their money on better insulating their home, replacing an old fossil-fuelled boiler with an air-source heat pump could be a good move. This typically costs £10,000-£12,000. Households can use the £5,000 voucher in conjunction with the government’s Renewable Heat Incentive payments – combined with the potential savings on your energy bill this could cover the full cost of the new system. While the scheme has built-in protections, to ensure that work can only be done by approved tradespeople who have registered with TrustMark, Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says scammers are sending emails about the scheme and using a bogus weblinks to steal personal data. Homeowners have also reported being cold-called and sent texts from people claiming to be offering insulation as part of the scheme. Be on your guard and only use reputable tradespeople."
"A new British standard for biodegradable plastic is being published which scientists say will cut through a jungle of classifications that leave consumers confused. Plastic claiming to be biodegradable will have to pass a test to prove it breaks down into a harmless wax which contains no microplastics or nanoplastics in order to make the grade, published by the British Standards Institution. The benchmark for the new standard was reached by a British company called Polymateria, which has created a formula to transform plastic items such as bottles, cups and film into a sludge at a specific moment in the product’s life. Once the breakdown of the product begins, most items will have decomposed down to carbon dioxide, water and sludge within two years, triggered by sunlight, air and water. The products that can be transformed include the most common litter items, such as food cartons, food films and bottles. The biodegradable products created contain a clear recycle-by date, to show consumers that they have a timeframe to dispose of them responsibly in the recycling system before they start breaking down. The bio-transformation chemicals created by Polymateria are added to plastic in the manufacturing stage of an item, with a bespoke element in the formula for each type of plastic item being produced. Niall Dunne, chief executive of Polymateria, said in tests using the biotransformation formula, polyethylene film fully broke down in 226 days and plastic cups in 336 days. Currently many plastic products in litter persist in the environment for hundreds of years. “We have designed this around the consumer,” said Dunne.  “We wanted to cut through this eco-classification jungle and take a more optimistic view around inspiring and motivating the consumer to do the right thing. “We now have a base to substantiate any claims that are being made and to create a new area of credibility around the whole biodegradable space.” To meet the standard, the polymer has to pass tests which show it will biodegrade to a harmless state in real-world situations. Scott Steedman, director of standards at BSI, said: “Tackling the global challenge of plastic waste requires imagination and innovation. New ideas need agreed, publicly available, independent standards to enable the delivery of trusted solutions by industry. “PAS 9017 is the first stakeholder consensus on how to measure the biodegradability of polyolefins that will accelerate the verification of technologies for plastic biodegradation.” The new standard was sponsored by Polymateria, based at Imperial College, London and agreed after independent review and discussions with stakeholders in the industry, the waste and recycling group Wrap, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Chris Wallis, vice-president of innovation at Polymateria, said the formula was designed to complement a range of scenarios for responsibly disposing of plastic waste, including recycling and reusing in a circular economy. “If any of these systems fails, if there are leaks into the environment because of unmanaged waste, we finally have a solution,” said Wallis. “We want to be complementary and part of multiple solutions that will reduce the problem of plastic pollution on the planet. “If plastic waste is not disposed of correctly or if waste management system ends up leaking the plastic into the natural environment, this technology is designed to kick in to chemically operate and turn the material into harmless waxes.”"
"Toilets specially designed to save water are wasting more than they conserve, the UK’s largest water firm has warned. Campaigners have warned for years that dual-flush toilets, introduced as more efficient alternatives that were expected to use less than half the amount of water per flush, are more prone to leaks. The problem is said to be so great that the costs are outweighing the benefits. “Because there’s so many loos that continuously flow all through the day and night, collectively that water loss is now exceeding the amount of water the dual-flush design should be saving,” said Andrew Tucker, water efficiency manager at Thames Water. “The volume of water loss is getting bigger every day as more people refurbish and retrofit older toilets and as more homes are built, so it’s a growing problem.” The campaign group Waterwise has estimated that about 400m litres of water leak from UK toilets every day. It says that would be enough to supply 2.8 million people; equivalent to the combined populations of Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool and Bristol. The group has said that a single leaking toilet wastes an average of between between 215 and 400 litres of water per day and that between 5% and 8% of all toilets are leaky. And the majority of those use the newer dual-flush mechanism. Thames Water said poor design and materials cause water to flow continuously into the bowl. And, according to the BBC, the Bathroom Manufacturers Association has acknowledged that the design of many dual-flush toilets is inherently more prone to leakage. The majority of them use the drop valve system, which sits at the bottom of the cistern and opens to allow the water to flow out when the flush is pressed. Debris and other issues can cause the mechanism to fail to close, meaning water continually flows from the cistern and into the bowl. Older cisterns tend to use a siphon system, which works by pushing water upwards until it reaches a point at which it can flow into the bowl. Because that point is above the waterline when the toilet is not being flushed, the system is less likely to develop the same sort of leak. “A siphon will not leak whereas an outlet valve – if we look at the figures we’ve got – they could leak within a week of installation. It could be two years but they will leak,” said Jason Parker, the managing director of Thomas Dudley Ltd, one of the UK’s largest plumbing manufacturers. He told the BBC: “If we’re serious about wasting water and we want to stop it, the only way to do that is put a siphon back in.” Dual-flush toilets have two buttons that allow different quantities of water to flow. They typically put out four or six litres, with the smaller quantity meant for clearing urine. Waterwise has said that fixing leaky toilets could “contribute around 10% of the additional water capacity needed to cope with an extreme drought in England by 2050”."
"Digging the vegetable garden, I uncovered a potato, overlooked in an earlier harvest. I wondered if it was fit for the pot, then noticed the small hole in the side. A long column of pale, centimetre-long, thread-like animals marched out into the sunlight and fell to the ground. I captured a few of the army that had hollowed out the potato. The first question, in my mental identification key to soil animals, was how many legs per segment? Easy: two, so they must be millipedes, not centipedes. Second question: total number of legs? Almost impossible to count, because they were never still. Scores of limbs rose and fell, in a rippling, undulating wave – mesmerising choreography that travelled the length of the animals’ bodies, in an endless cycle. Count the segments and multiply by two, perhaps? That wouldn’t help much. I had 15 of these restless creatures, of various sizes, in the collecting vial. Some were just a few millimetres long. As millipedes grow, they add more segments, like adding extra carriages to the end of a train. I couldn’t be certain that any was a fully mature adult, but the longest seemed to have about 40 pairs of legs. When I shook the captives, a thousand feet stampeded. Fortunately, this species has a convenient identification feature. They were spotted snake millipedes, Blaniulus guttulatus, given away by red spots on the flanks of most of their segments: ozopores, stink glands, reputed to repel predators. Now it was time to let them go. They loitered on the surface briefly, then disappeared into a crevice, to resume their subterranean lives. I imagined them, head tucked down, forcing their way through gaps in freshly dug soil, driven forward by a relentless rugby scrum of 40 pairs of short, powerful legs. Back to the digging, with the aroma of fresh, damp soil and mouldering leaves rising from every turn of the garden fork. Nearby, a hungry blackbird hurled fallen leaves aside, foraging for whatever morsels lay beneath. Among the scents of autumn, millipedes’ stink glands might not protect them from its attention but, in the deep, dark caverns of the soil, repulsive body odour might be the key to survival. "
"One-fifth of the world’s countries are at risk of their ecosystems collapsing because of the destruction of wildlife and their habitats, according to an analysis by the insurance firm Swiss Re. Natural “services” such as food, clean water and air, and flood protection have already been damaged by human activity. More than half of global GDP – $42tn (£32tn) – depends on high-functioning biodiversity, according to the report, but the risk of tipping points is growing. Countries including Australia, Israel and South Africa rank near the top of Swiss Re’s index of risk to biodiversity and ecosystem services, with India, Spain and Belgium also highlighted. Countries with fragile ecosystems and large farming sectors, such as Pakistan and Nigeria, are also flagged up. Countries including Brazil and Indonesia had large areas of intact ecosystems but had a strong economic dependence on natural resources, which showed the importance of protecting their wild places, Swiss Re said. “A staggering fifth of countries globally are at risk of their ecosystems collapsing due to a decline in biodiversity and related beneficial services,” said Swiss Re, one of the world’s biggest reinsurers and a linchpin of the global insurance industry. “If the ecosystem service decline goes on [in countries at risk], you would see then scarcities unfolding even more strongly, up to tipping points,” said Oliver Schelske, lead author of the research. Jeffrey Bohn, Swiss Re’s chief research officer, said: “This is the first index to our knowledge that pulls together indicators of biodiversity and ecosystems to cross-compare around the world, and then specifically link back to the economies of those locations.” The index was designed to help insurers assess ecosystem risks when setting premiums for businesses but Bohn said it could have a wider use as it “allows businesses and governments to factor biodiversity and ecosystems into their economic decision-making”. The UN revealed in September that the world’s governments failed to meet a single target to stem biodiversity losses in the last decade, while leading scientists warned in 2019 that humans were in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems. More than 60 national leaders recently pledged to end the destruction. The Swiss Re index is built on 10 key ecosystem services identified by the world’s scientists and uses scientific data to map the state of these services at a resolution of one square kilometre across the world’s land. The services include provision of clean water and air, food, timber, pollination, fertile soil, erosion control, and coastal protection, as well as a measure of habitat intactness. Those countries with more than 30% of their area found to have fragile ecosystems were deemed to be at risk of those ecosystems collapsing. Just one in seven countries had intact ecosystems covering more than 30% of their country area. Among the G20 leading economies, South Africa and Australia were seen as being most at risk, with China 7th, the US 9th and the UK 16th. Alexander Pfaff, a professor of public policy, economics and environment at Duke University in the US, said: “Societies, from local to global, can do much better when we not only acknowledge the importance of contributions from nature – as this index is doing – but also take that into account in our actions, private and public.” Pfaff said it was important to note that the economic impacts of the degradation of nature began well before ecosystem collapse, adding: “Naming a problem may well be half the solution, [but] the other half is taking action.” Swiss Re said developing and developed countries were at risk from biodiversity loss. Water scarcity, for example, could damage manufacturing sectors, properties and supply chains.  Bohn said about 75% of global assets were not insured, partly because of insufficient data. He said the index could help quantify risks such as crops losses and flooding."
"A surfer is missing after receiving “a serious shark bite” in front of fellow surfers at a beach near Esperance in Western Australia. Police on Friday evening said several witnesses had seen the man being attacked at Kelp Beds beach in Wylie Bay before 11am local time. A surfboard with “obvious signs of shark attack” was recovered a short time later. “There were approximately six to eight surfers that were in the water at the time and a number of bystanders on the beach as well that all witnessed the attack,” Sen Sgt Justin Tarasinski told reporters on Friday. “So yeah it was busy at the time. A number of witnesses have seen the attack occur. We have obviously taken some witness accounts but we won’t go into detail on those accounts just at this point in time.” The state’s premier, Mark McGowan, revealed that another surfer had tried to pull the victim away from the shark. “Unfortunately he hasn’t been recovered at this point in time,” the premier told reporters. “It’s a very, very difficult and potentially tragic situation happening in Esperance.” The popular beach has seen shark attacks before. Laeticia Brouwer, 17, died following a shark bite at the same beach in April 2017. In 2014, surfer Sean Pollard lost an arm and his other hand in a shark attack at the same site. Witnesses told Nine newspapers that they had seen a shark while swimming in the water moments before the attack. “I spotted a shark, 2.5-3 metres big, about 50 to 100 metres away. I called out to [my partner] to get out and next minute we had [ambulances] fly past us,” Sammy Bamford said. Tarasinski said a large search crew had been looking for the surfer. It included two surf life saving jet skis, two volunteer Marine Rescue vessels, and two other vessels. The senior sergeant said the surfer’s board had washed up on the beach not long after the attack. “The surfboard washed up nearby to where the attack occurred with obvious signs of shark attack,” he said. “The search will continue today as long as conditions are favourable and for as long as those conditions allow us.” An earlier statement from the WA primary industries department said it was helping police with “a serious shark bite incident at Kelp Beds beach in Esperance”. Boats were in the water as part of a marine search and rescue operation, the statement said. Beaches were closed from Wylie Head to Cape Le Grand National Park. Earlier this week, drone footage captured professional surfer Matt Wilkinson’s narrow escape from a great white shark measuring about 2.5 metres off the coast of Ballina in northern New South Wales. There have been six confirmed deaths from shark bites in Australia in 2020. Experienced diver Gary Johnson, 57, was killed by a shark near Cull Island in Esperance on Western Australia’s south coast in January. A shark killed 23-year-old Queensland wildlife ranger, Zachary Robba, in April off North West Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Gold Coast surfer Rob Pedretti, 60, died after he was attacked at Salt Beach at South Kingscliff in northern NSW in June. In July, a 36-year-old Sunshine Coast man died after being mauled while spearfishing off Queensland’s Fraser Island. Later the same month, a teenager died while surfing at Wilsons Headland at Wooli Beach off northern NSW. A 46-year-old Gold Coast man, Nick Slater, died in September after being bitten by a shark while surfing at Greenmount Beach at Coolangatta."
"The mass die-off of thousands of songbirds in south-western US was caused by long-term starvation, made worse by unseasonably cold weather probably linked to the climate crisis, scientists have said. Flycatchers, swallows and warblers were among the migratory birds “falling out of the sky” in September, with carcasses found in New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arizona and Nebraska. A USGS National Wildlife Health Center necropsy has found 80% of specimens showed typical signs of starvation. Muscles controlling the birds’ wings were severely shrunken, blood was found in their intestinal tract and they had kidney failure as well as an overall loss of body fat. The remaining 20% were not in good enough condition to carry out proper tests. Nearly 10,000 dead birds were reported to the wildlife mortality database by citizens, and previous estimates suggest hundreds of thousands may have died. “It looks like the immediate cause of death in these birds was emaciation as a result of starvation,” said Jonathan Sleeman, director of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, which received 170 bird carcasses and did necropsies on 40 of them. “It’s really hard to attribute direct causation, but given the close correlation of the weather event with the death of these birds, we think that either the weather event forced these birds to migrate prior to being ready, or maybe impacted their access to food sources during their migration.” The first deaths were reported on 20 August at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, with accounts of birds appearing lethargic and congregating in groups before dying. Most deaths happened around 9 and 10 September during a bout of cold weather that probably meant food was particularly scarce. In a weakened state, the birds seemed to become disorientated, flying into cars and buildings, some dying on impact and others landing on the ground, subsequently dying from cold temperatures or being eaten by predators. “We’re not talking about short-term starvation – this is a longer-term starvation,” said Martha Desmond, a professor in the biology department at New Mexico State University (NMSU), who collected carcasses. “They became so emaciated they actually had to turn to wasting their major flight muscles. This means that this isn’t something that happened overnight.” The birds probably would have started their migration in poor condition, which could be related to the “mega-drought” in the south west of the country. “Here in New Mexico we’ve seen a very dry year, and we’re forecast to have more of those dry years. And in turn I would say it appears that a change in climate is playing a role in this, and that we can expect to see more of this in the future,” said Desmond. “I think it’s just very sad,” she added. “Especially the thought that we are seeing some long-term starvation in some of these birds.” Sleeman could not say if this event was directly related to climate change but acknowledged that it is making extreme weather events more likely. Desmond previously described seeing so many individuals and species dying as a national tragedy. Most of the birds were insect and berry eaters that migrate from tundra landscapes in Alaska and Canada to winter in Central and South America. Most of them have to stop and refuel every few days on their migration. Concerns were raised about wildfires in California causing birds to re-route their migration inland over the Chihuahuan desert but necropsies showed no smoke damage in their lungs. The centre also ran tests for contagious bacterial and viral diseases, parasites and evidence of pesticide poisoning, all of which came back negative. Allison Salas, a graduate student at NMSU, said the volume of carcasses she had collected had given her chills. She said: “The fact that we’re finding hundreds of these birds dying, just kind of falling out of the sky is extremely alarming.” Desmond’s team is hoping to get funding to support more research into mass die-offs in birds so they can better monitor what is happening. Sleeman agreedthat large-scale mass mortality wildlife events are happening more frequently. “It’s something we definitely need to keep track of,” he added.

"The steep way up to James and my sister Mary’s documented orchard of local varieties is littered with shoals of trampled apples – too small to have been much temptation for the youngsters who dared to scrump in our grandparents’ day. Clusters of berries cover a 50ft holly beside an outgrown Norway spruce, while hazels in the sheltering hedge banks show tight catkins among fading leaves, and dark red haws load thorns. Cidery smells exude from fallen apples such as Mr North’s Cornish Pine, now surplus to the earlier juicing sessions; remains of Mrs Bull’s, a spectacular large crimson apple, lie almost submerged in bedraggled grass. Heavily laden boughs have split from the Herefordshire Pippin, but the fragrant, orange-striped apples hang on to intact branches, unlike the Listener, which has dropped all its primrose coloured fruit (shown by genetic tests as synonymous with Early Bower and the Sack and Sugar). As the afternoon sun shines through the turning leaves of cherries, a speckled wood butterfly pitches on a carpet of Hocking’s Green, but the yellowish-green Long Keeper and Hambling’s Seedling remain fixed to leafless twigs. Arching canopies spread across the avenues of maturing productive trees, with some sturdy trunks encircled in distinctive drifts of neglected early fruit such as Lizzy, conical-shaped and bright green, which was found at Golant above the River Fowey. The best keepers have been carefully gathered, stored in shallow drawers in the mouse-proofed, insulated shed. King Byerd, extra large this year, should last until May; Cornish Aromatic, with complex perfumed flavours, improves with keeping; the newer Christmas Pippin – officially named after trialling and patenting by an enthusiast who found the original chance seedling just off the M5 near Bristol – is another long-lasting dessert apple. Today, James and Mary are having a break from juicing, picking and the clearing away of prunings from the highest cherry trees – by visiting a cider maker on the north Cornwall coast. They have taken samples of their prolific Colloggett Pippin, the Philleigh, Trecarrell Mill Number 1 and Whitpot Sweet – too late to supplement this year’s sparse crops from orchards in that exposed and windy area, but perhaps useful in the future if the producer can organise pickers and transport for the fruit."
"The river at the bottom of our garden is like a gigantic rain gauge. Normally it is a humble tributary, lurching past the garden almost grudgingly, with its head down, with barely the current to stir the duckweed. But after the deluges of the past few days, it has morphed into a confident swirl. Two things always happen when it gets into its macho flow. The first is that the otter appears, as it did today. The strength and heft of the main River Stour across the fields is perhaps a deterrent, a little too tiring for fishing, so the otter re-routes to our more manageable stretch. The other event is that our kingfishers vanish. Until recently the tributary has been a kingfisher highway. The pint-sized rockets of electric blue have been whizzing past every few minutes, making observation a little like a slowed down tennis match, head turning one way, then the other. The local pair had a brood, and several youngsters have used the backwater for training. They need it, too. Peering down into the sleepy shallows, they learn to adjust for refraction, to compensate for wind and rain, and figure out where the minnows like to hide. But their apprenticeship has been rudely interrupted by the floodwater. The river’s hissy fit has unsettled the social cohesion. There are fewer comfortable spots to fish, and those are taken up by territorial adult kingfishers and a few domineering youngsters. For several weeks we have seen skirmishes, individuals laying claim to their own stretch, as anglers often do. The kingfishers chase and jostle with iridescent incandescence, in deadly earnest, because a winter territory is a significant prize. Now that the first floods have come, the losers are being evicted and must take their chances elsewhere. Sometimes, apparently, siblings leave town together. Displaced kingfishers settle by lakes and marshes, and down here in Dorset a significant number also find their way to estuaries and coasts, where they look decidedly incongruous on seawalls and jetties. It’s a harsh reality that many don’t survive. Now that the torpor of early autumn has gone, we won’t see many more kingfishers on our stretch. We’ll miss them – and fear for them, too."
"A new report has exposed the scale and impact of mining on indigenous reserves in Amazon countries as gold prices soared during the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 20% of indigenous lands are overlapped by mining concessions and illegal mining, it found, covering 450,000 sq km (174,000 sq miles) – and 31% of Amazon indigenous reserves are affected. The report, released on Wednesday by the World Resources Institute, said indigenous people should be given more legal rights to manage and use their lands, and called for better environmental safeguards. As pressure mounts over the issue, a leading Brazilian thinktank has called for regulations tracing gold sold by financial institutions. “The extent of mining concessions and illegal mining areas that overlap indigenous areas in the Amazon is much more significant than many people thought,” said Peter Veit, director of the WRI’s Land and Resource Rights Initiative, and one of the report’s authors. It used geospatial analysis and literature and science reviews, and estimated that half a million small-scale goldminers are active in the Amazon region. Only half of legal mining concessions in the Amazon are active, Veit said. But with mining seen by many Amazon countries as key to development, that could change. In Brazil, the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sent a bill to Congress to formally legalise mining on protected indigenous reserves. “The implications for the environment and for indigenous peoples could significantly increase if those concessions that have yet to be allocated were to start up,” Veit said. Rising gold prices – which hit nearly $2,100 (£1,625) an ounce in August – have helped to drive wildcat miners into the Amazon. “Gold prices had been rising for years but the threat to economies from the novel coronavirus led to a surge in prices – up about 35% this year – as investors sought the perceived safety of gold. As prices rise, so does demand and mining,” the report said. In Brazil, invasions of indigenous lands by garimpeiros – as wildcat miners are called – have increased since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. Many voted for Bolsonaro after he promised to legalise their work. In 2019, deforestation caused by garimpeiros in the Amazon rose 23% on 2018 to a record 10,500 hectares (26,000 acres), O Globo newspaper reported in May, following a freedom of information request to the environment agency Ibama. Army operations have failed to clear tens of thousands of miners from Brazil’s biggest indigenous reserve, the Yanomami. From October 2018 to March 2020 alone, nearly 2,000ha were degraded by mining in the reserve, the report said. The Munduruku Indigenous Reserve in the Brazilian Amazon state of Pará has been heavily affected. Garimpeiro investors have paid local indigenous people to help them enter the reserve and work within it, said Ademir Kaba Munduruku, a local leader. “This has been imitated by other Munduruku and become a big problem,” he said. “Alcoholism, prostitution, drugs, violence, division within the Munduruku people, contamination of river beds have all increased.” Federal prosecutors are investigating whether a Brazilian air force plane flew indigenous garimpeiros from his region to Brasília for a meeting with the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, during a military operation to control illegal mining, following media reports. The operation was suspended. The Brazilian thinktank Instituto Escolhas (Choices Institute) has opened a public consultation for a proposal it will present to Brazil’s central bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate gold purchases, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported. Garimpeiros presently just need to show ID and sign a form, it said. Brazilian gold exports rose 35% from January to August, hitting $3bn, Folha said. Legal mining can also come at a high cost, Veit said. “Many companies don’t adhere to the law, the letter of the law, many don’t seem to adhere to their agreements with the government,” he said. Case studies from Peru and Ecuador document legal struggles between indigenous groups, governments and mining companies. In Guyana, Patamona indigenous people from Campbelltown involved in artisanal mining have “shown some willingness” to work in a more sustainable way, banning mercury and rehabilitating mining sites, the report said. During a virtual press conference on Wednesday, Michael McGarrell, human rights coordinator for the Amazon indigenous organisation COICA, said his Patamona indigenous people in Guyana had long practised traditional, low-impact, artisanal mining. “Our people were mining before anyone came; however, it was done in a way that [meant] it had minimal impact and it continues to this day,” he said. But Amazon indigenous peoples lose out when mining companies and illegal operations enter their land. “We are under siege from legal and illegal mining and our governments are doing little to enforce the rights that do exist,” McGarrell said."
"Heathrow will argue in the supreme court this week that its proposed third runway would only ever be built in accordance with Britain’s climate commitments, as it seeks to overturn a court of appeal verdict that stopped the airport’s expansion plans. A two-day hearing starts on Wednesday which could allow Heathrow to proceed once more with building an additional runway.  The expansion plans were approved in principle by parliament in 2018, under Theresa May’s government. Legal action by climate campaigners initially failed to force a judicial review. However, in a landmark judgment, the court of appeal ruled in favour of the case brought by the environmental litigation charity Plan B and Friends of the Earth. Judges found that ministers had failed to take adequate account of Britain’s climate commitments under the 2015 Paris climate agreement when drawing up the aviation national policy statement (ANPS) which permitted Heathrow expansion. The new government under Boris Johnson, a long-time opponent of the third runway, accepted the court ruling in February, leaving Heathrow to challenge it alone. The airport will argue that the runway will be bound to comply with Britain’s carbon targets when it seeks to obtain planning permission, regardless of whether the then transport secretary, Chris Grayling, adequately took account of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The hearing will be conducted by video conference because of Covid-19 restrictions, and streamed live online. The verdict is not expected to be delivered until at least January. Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, said the government could “at least see a problem in admitting it’s not taking the Paris agreement seriously, given that maintaining the Paris temperature limit is vital to our collective future … Heathrow Airport Limited, however, has no such concerns.” A Heathrow spokesperson said the airport fully expected to be held to account over climate obligations through the planning process, and that the ANPS made clear that approval for its runway “would be refused” if it had a material impact on the UK’s ability to meet its carbon reduction obligations. ”We’re appealing to the supreme court to allow this thorough planning process to proceed as it was designed. “Given the timescales required to deliver complex infrastructure of this scale in the UK, it’s critical that we get on with laying the groundwork today for future operations that will be essential for a successful global Britain in the decade after Brexit,” they added. The battle for expansion comes despite the pandemic leaving Heathrow with only a fraction of its normal air traffic and requiring just one runway to operate. The Unite union is balloting for a strike over plans by Heathrow to impose pay cuts of up to 20% on long-serving workers, which the airport has defended as a means to preserve jobs. John McDonnell, the Labour MP for the neighbouring Hayes and Harlington constituency, accused Heathrow of exploiting the pandemic to reduce wages, adding: “There is no excuse for the company imposing permanent wage cuts when we know that this crisis is temporary.”"
"Super-smart gulls flock to school playgrounds shortly before break times in order to hoover up the scraps, a study has shown. The birds also target rubbish dumps, but mainly on weekdays when fresh waste is being delivered. Having a snack snatched from your hand by a greedy gull is already a common, if unwelcome, occurrence. But the latest research shows the birds are even smarter than thought: they know where and when their meals are being served. The research was conducted in Bristol but related behaviour has been reported from Spain to Japan. The scientists think that the gulls’ ability to adapt to a human timetable is one reason populations of gulls have soared in cities in the last 40 years. In Bristol, the researchers followed herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls that nest on roofs near the city centre. A dozen had small GPS backpacks fitted in order to track their movements and the scientists also observed their behaviour at their favourite feeding spots in the summer of 2018. “They are super-smart,” said Anouk Spelt, at the University of Bristol. “At the school there were not many gulls around until break time. Then you saw them sitting on the rooftops. The moment the bell went off, they all flew up and started looking for leftovers.” She said she was not too surprised at the gulls’ ability to learn when food was available as they had heard stories, including birds regularly knocking on windows at 6pm looking for dinner leftovers. “We’d heard all these anecdotes but now we can show it’s definitely true,” Spelt said. The research is the most in-depth analysis of how urban gulls find food. Another recent study in Spain showed yellow-legged gulls can time their visits to rubbish dumps. Earlier work in Japan showed gulls visited fish processing plants and markets at the best times. The analysis, published in the journal Ibis, showed the average number of gulls present at the school was three times higher when the children were outside eating their snacks or packed lunches at morning break or lunchtime. The scientists spent a month observing a school, a waste site and a park. The GPS data showed the gulls visited 25 schools, with their visits always most common at break times. At the rubbish site, new waste was only unloaded during working hours on weekdays and this was when the most gulls flew in. “The predictable timing of food at these sites appears to have resulted in the birds adopting a sit‐and‐wait approach, instead of actively searching for food,” said the researchers. “This may allow them to minimise the time and energy foraging.” The gulls’ visits to the park were usually in the early morning and did not coincide with human activity. Instead, the researchers saw them searching for worms and insects, which are present in higher numbers during these early hours. “Most people don’t really like gulls – they are aggressive,” said Spelt. “So we wanted to show why these gulls are in cities and what moves them to be around humans.” Cities offer safer rooftop nesting sites, warmer temperatures and more readily available food. “So there are many different reasons, but we now think that [the ability to adapt to human timetables] is one of them,” she said. Spelt hopes research like this will help councils better understand gull behaviour and manage potential nuisances. For the problem of food being snatched out of people’s hands, other researchers reported a solution last year. Extensive tests in Cornish towns showed the bold birds back off from your snacks if you stare them out."
"Illegal and destructive practices by industrial trawlers in Ghana have led to one of the worst overfishing crises in west Africa, with small pelagic species known as “the people’s fish” driven almost to the brink of collapse. Scores of small-scale fishers are now fighting back against illegal trawlers using a smartphone app that allows them to record, log and report any alleged fishery crimes they spot out at sea. Evidence gathered via the app, developed by the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), an NGO working in Ghana and other west African countries to help combat overfishing, was used to report an alleged infraction of fisheries law to Ghana’s Fisheries Commission late last year. A canoe fisher who spotted an industrial trawler with its nets allegedly within the six-mile nautical exclusion zone reserved for small-scale fishers, used the app to photograph and film the boat, and a report was submitted to the Ghanaian government. When a user spots a vessel they believe is illegally fishing, coming too close to shore, or damaging canoes or gear, they use the app to take a photo of the boat, with its name or identification number. The app records the location and uploads it to a central database, managed by the EJF, where it can be used to catch and penalise perpetrators. The tool, called Dase, which means “evidence” in Fante, is also being developed for use in Liberia, where dangerous clashes between canoes and industrial trawlers have been reported. Researchers predict the total loss of small pelagic fish populations, the staple of coastal communities in Ghana, within five years unless urgent action is taken. “Illegal fishing is causing the collapse of Ghana’s staple fish stocks and the loss of food security, livelihoods and tens of millions of dollars in national revenue,” said Nana Jojo Solomon, executive member of the Ghana National Canoe Fishermen Council, at the launch event in Cape Coast. “This app means canoe fishers no longer have to stand by while industrial vessels fish illegally in their fishing grounds.” So far 100 small-scale fishers from communities active in surveillance along Ghana’s 350-mile coast have downloaded the app, according to EJF, which developed the app based on the Collect software platform under the EU-funded Far Dwuma Nkodo project."
"During a break in the rain, I dashed down to the greenhouse at the bottom of the garden. I was seduced into lingering too long. A torrential downpour is hammering on the roof. It’s 70 paces back to the house, far enough away to be soaked to the skin: I’m trapped for a while. This creaky, leaky 8ft-by-6ft house of glass and aluminium is 40 years old. In autumn last year, an overhanging branch crashed through the roof during a storm. The decision to repair or demolish was made on a coin toss: heads; the frame was bent back into shape and reglazed, in time to plant pots of bulbs whose flowers brightened this spring over the Covid-19 lockdown. Despite the cacophony on the roof, and a dripping leak, it’s snug in here. There’s a pleasant aroma of damp earth, with a hint of rosemary and lavender fragrance from rooted cuttings. Shoots from the first of next spring’s daffodil bulbs are already poking through the soil in their pots. And some wildflower seedlings, from pinches of seed collected on autumn walks, are sprouting. Nothing in gardening is quite so satisfying as raising plants from seed, watching from the moment the embryonic root breaks through the seed coat to the unfurling of the first flower petals. Some wildflowers need winter’s chill to break their dormancy, but mignonette, agrimony and angelica are already through, their first leaves clasped like hands in prayer as they push up through the soil, then splaying wide to catch the brief daylight hours. The star performer is fox-and-cubs hawkweed, Pilosella aurantiacum. Its fulvous flowers, like miniature dandelions, the colour of glowing embers, were the reason for collecting seeds, but now I can see that the emerging leaves have their own peculiar beauty. Each is protected, above and below, by stockades of tall, silvery hairs. The sound of rain on the roof is fading, but I’m in no hurry to leave. Coaxing seedlings through the damp, cold winter months can be tricky; some will likely succumb to grey mould. But sowing them now, during lockdown, seemed like a small gesture of faith in the future, with the promise of brighter days to come."
"Fur has never been less fashionable. In recent years a raft of designer labels – Gucci, Chanel, Versace, Armani, Coach and Prada, to name a few – have gone fur-free. In 2018, London fashion week banned fur from its catwalks. Celebrities have given up fur too, from the queen of social media, Kim Kardashian West, who announced that she had “remade” all of her fur coats in fake fur in 2019, to the Queen of the UK, Elizabeth II, who renounced fur in “any new outfits” the same year. Even US Vogue editor Anna Wintour – whose fox and mink coats were once as much a front row staple as her dark sunglasses – has been wearing fake fur recently, turning up to fashion week events in “fur-free” coats by Gucci and Stella McCartney.The recent development of luxurious, realistic-looking fur-free furs has helped some brands shed the animal hide from collections. So, too, has the zeitgeist: in the UK, interest in veganism quadrupled between 2014 and 2019, while 93% of the British population does not wear fur, according to a Humane Society International/YouGov poll.Even Fendi, which started life as a fur house in 1925, has scaled back its use of animal hides, emphasising the less controversial parts of its offering – from lace dresses to handbags – at recent catwalk shows. But fur still exists, for a certain customer who can afford, for example, a grey £14,900 inlaid mink parka or a £290 fox Pom-Pom bag charm, both currently selling on the Fendi website. Louis Vuitton, too, has customers who are fond of fur, as evidenced by current wares that include a £7,900 fox intarsia jacket and a £32,500 mink coat. China represents 80% of the fur trade, according to Jing Daily, and 35% of overall luxury spending. Euromonitor projects that the manufacture of fur in China will rise from £6.6bn last year to £6.9bn in 2021. Russia and the US are big fur markets, too, as is South Korea (one of that country’s best-known female rappers was photographed in a very real-looking fur coat this week). In the west, however, though fur still has its fans – the US produced £346m worth of fur for clothes and apparel in 2019, according to Euromonitor – fewer high profile figures will be photographed in a full fur coat. Outliers include Jennifer Lopez, who wore a huge fur coat in much of the 2019 movie Hustlers, though she was protested against at the movie’s premiere. Hip hop stars, including Cardi B and Diddy, have also been photographed in fur. Fur occupies a significant position within African American culture, Jasmine Sanders wrote in the New York Times last year, adding that “there is a sense among many black women that this broader, cultural disavowal of fur has coincided with our increased ability to purchase it.”  Scores of high profile figures wear fur in stealthier ways, too, with celebrities ranging from David Beckham to Emma Stone wearing Canada Goose jackets, which have coyote trim hoods. Such trims were one way the fur industry clung on to market share, until recently, but now even those are being rethought, after animal rights campaigns, with Canada Goose announcing that it would use reclaimed fur from 2022.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"The federal government was preparing to legislate to hand environmental approval powers to state governments at the beginning of the year, well in advance of recommendations from a review of national laws that proposed such changes. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show Scott Morrison told the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, in February he wanted to introduce a bill to transfer environmental approval powers to state governments by midyear. The documents, covering months of correspondence between the federal and WA governments, show McGowan pushed for the change and stressed it should not be delayed by a review of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The two governments drew up a timeline and originally planned to reach “in principle agreement” on a bilateral approval agreement by 5 October that would then be signed by mid-December, allowing WA to take responsibility for decisions under national environment laws. The 5 October deadline has not been met, with legislation that would make the transfer of environmental approval powers to state and territory governments less open to legal challenge still to be debated by the Senate. The letters and emails show the federal and WA governments have been discussing the transfer of environmental approval powers for about a year. Suzanne Milthorpe, of the Wilderness Society, said the documents showed that every step taken by the government in relation to the review of national environmental laws had been “aimed at delivering a predetermined outcome”. The review of Australia’s environmental laws by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel received about 30,000 submissions. “None of these private discussions about the drafting of the bill that is currently before parliament or what a Western Australian bilateral agreement might encompass were informed by the evidence from the independent review,” Milthorpe said. Morrison has signalled the government’s desire to speed up environmental approvals and cut so-called green tape since last year, but the potential for changes to Australia’s laws was first mentioned by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, in April. Ley said at the time she would be prepared to introduce early pieces of legislation if an interim report by Samuel review indicated “sensible changes” could be made before his final report. In a speech in June, Morrison said there had been early discussions in national cabinet about moving to a “single touch” approvals process and it would return to the subject at a later date, informed by the Samuel review. The documents show McGowan wrote to Morrison on 22 November 2019 to say an agreement between the governments would “significantly reduce major project timeframes, duplication and costs”, the same date the Rio Tinto sent a similar request to Ley. The premier said he was confident WA’s existing systems were adequate to protect endangered species, habitats and heritage sites. Morrison replied to say he had asked Ley to consider whether a bill “could be introduced in the middle of this year”, given McGowan’s support for bilateral approval agreements, but stressed that any such bill would need bipartisan support, given the government “cannot preempt the outcome” of the Samuel review. On 10 March, McGowan wrote to Morrison again to say businesses and industry groups had welcomed the proposed bilateral approval agreement and believed it could be finalised “in the immediate term”. “It is particularly important that this matter does not get caught up in the wider, long-term independent review of the EPBC Act,” he said. Ley, and the assistant minister to the prime minister, Ben Morton, were also corresponding with Ley’s counterpart in WA, Stephen Dawson, about the matter. Ley wrote to Dawson on 26 May, again stressing the importance of not preempting the review, which would be “critical in determining the most effective ways to streamline environmental approvals”. “This is a once in a decade opportunity and bipartisan support will be key to implementing a balanced and substantive package of reforms.” But by 19 June the government had begun preparing legislation to change Australia’s environmental laws, 11 days before Samuel delivered his interim report, which found the country’s environment was in unsustainable decline. A briefing prepared ahead of a meeting between Ley and Dawson shows the federal environment department advised Ley on 23 June that Samuel would probably recommend the transfer of approval powers should be supported by clear standards that specified what environmental outcomes state governments would be expected to deliver. Officials wrote this was “underscored by recent events in WA” where questions had been raised about the adequacy of state-level protection of Indigenous heritage and the commonwealth’s role in protecting the national interest – presumably a reference to Rio Tinto’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old Indigenous heritage site in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. By 25 June, the federal and WA environment departments were discussing a bilateral approval agreement, and by 16 July the departments had begun meeting to “map out the process and timing”. Samuel’s interim report was released on 20 July, recommending that transfer of approval powers to states should occur under a framework of national environmental standards, with an independent regulator to enforce compliance with the laws. Ley rejected the proposal for an independent regulator, but said the government would introduce a bill in August to transfer approval powers and would “commence discussions with willing states”. She said interim national standards would be introduced at the same time as the bill. By August, the two departments had developed a timeline that included passage of a bill to streamline environmental approvals by 2 September. A draft approval agreement had been written by mid-August. The timeline refers to a plan to have interim national standards enshrined in national law by 3 September. But the bill the government ultimately introduced in late August contained no standards and was a near replica of the Abbott government’s 2014 one-stop shop laws. According to the timeline, the governments planned to put a draft bilateral approval agreement with WA out for public exhibition during September, with an “in principle” agreement to be reached by 5 October. This has not occurred. The government’s bill passed the lower house in early September but the Senate still has to debate it. The Wilderness Society’s Milthorpe said there was an “urgent need to restore credibility to this whole process”. She said the “only way I can see that is possible now” was if the government pulled the bill before parliament and retracted its offer to develop the agreement with WA until Samuel’s final report was tabled and the government produced a response that would turn around Australia’s record on extinction. A spokesman for Ley said the government’s support for “streamlining regulation” was well known and the proposed changes to the law that were before the parliament had remained government policy since the one-stop shop legislation was voted down in 2014. “Passing these amendments has remained government policy since that time,” he said. “Discussions with Western Australia earlier this year were within that context and the context of the existing legislation. “They coincided with negotiations on renewing the state’s agreement on bilateral assessments.” The government’s bill is listed for debate in the Senate this week. Ley’s spokesman said it was “the first tranche of legislative changes expected to follow the Samuel review”. A spokesman for the WA government said formal negotiations between the two governments began in August, after Ley issued a notice of intent to reach an agreement. The spokesman said WA “already has the nation’s highest environmental standards” and Samuel’s review had “confirmed the important role that bilateral agreements can play”. “The state government has made no secret of its desire to secure a bilateral agreement. We are committed to reducing duplication and unnecessary delays in project approval timelines,” he said. Labor, the Greens and the crossbench have raised concerns it has not been put to a committee for inquiry, was brought to the parliament before Samuel’s final report is released, and does not contain a reference to standards. Samuel delivered his final report to the government at the end of October."
"Admirers of national parks and world-class trout streams in the state of Montana have expressed alarm over the election of a new Republican governor and his environmental plans. The governor, former software developer Greg Gianforte, has in the past sought to strip protections from 700,000 acres of wilderness, and his conservative “Montana Comeback Plan” election platform promises to “streamline” permitting processes to increase logging, coalmining, and oil and gas production. In May 2017, while running for a Montana congressional seat that he won, Gianforte was charged with assault after “bodyslamming” Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs to the floor. Gianforte pleaded guilty to assault and apologized for the incident, and also pledged to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Donald Trump later praised Gianforte at a rally in Montana, saying “Any guy that can do a body slam – that’s my guy.” While in Congress, Gianforte made a habit of attacking protections for public lands and water. “I‘m concerned about loss of access [to public lands and waters], sales of public land to corporate interests, rolling back environmental protections, wet-blanketing efforts to address the climate crisis and innovations in clean energy, and the loss of funding for management and maintenance of public lands,” said Juanita Vero, a Missoula county commissioner and multi-generational rancher in the Blackfoot valley, who served as Montana Conservation Voters’ board chair for a time. A proposal formulated with Montana Senator Steve Daines would have stripped protections from more than a half-million acres of Wilderness Study Areas. If the move had been successful, it would have been the single biggest rollback of protected lands in Montana history.  Gianforte garnered headlines, many critical, in Montana for having sued the state to block stream access to a popular fishing access site on the East Gallatin River near Bozeman. Kristen Juras, his running mate for his gubernatorial campaign, once also penned an article arguing that Montana’s law guaranteeing river access to anglers and boaters goes too far.  This year, Gianforte introduced a federal bill that would have amended the US Endangered Species Act and delisted the grizzly bear. He also pledged to “review, roll back and repeal” regulations on extractive industries that he deems excessive or unnecessary, and is a proponent of exporting Montana coal and undoing emissions limits on power plants. “Gianforte is a major coal development booster,” Robin Saha, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Montana, told E&E News recently. “He has been silent on climate and energy policy beyond wanting to promote coal development and protect the coalmining and coal-fired power plant industries in Montana.” Gianforte did not respond to requests for comment. Given the evidence, the League of Conservation Voters, a not-for-profit that evaluates the environmental records of politicians, listed Gianforte on its Dirty Dozen in the States list of “the worst environmental candidates in the nation at the state and local level”. He has a lifetime score of just 5% from the LCV. A lifelong member of the National Rifle Association with a 92% rating from the organization, he invited it to move its offices to Montana a few months before the election. Montanans elected Republican candidates up and down the ballot, delivering the Montana GOP the biggest landslide a single party has received in decades. Gianforte rode his support for Trump to win by 16 points over his Democratic opponent. So did Steve Daines, who beat current Governor Steve Bullock for his second term in the US Senate, and Matt Rosendale, who will take over from Gianforte in the US House. Montana Republicans also swept the state downballot races. “If anything is going to get accomplished, the Democrats have got to figure out a way to work with our Republican majority,” said Vero, the rancher. “We’re not taking our marbles and going home. We’ve gotta stay at the table and play the game.”"
"Environmentalists have criticised a three-day tour of the Amazon that the Brazilian government staged for foreign ambassadors as a “sham” and “media propaganda” after it failed to stop at any environmentally devastated areas.  The tour ended on Friday and focused on better-protected areas of the northern Amazon. “The government prepared an itinerary that does not show the reality of the Amazon – the abandonment of indigenous peoples, the land grabbing, the illegal mining and the uncontrolled deforestation. It is a sham,” said Marcio Astrini, executive director of the Climate Observatory, an umbrella group of environmental NGOs.  Brazil’s vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, who hosted the tour and heads the government’s Amazon council, said seeing the effects of Amazon deforestation and fires close up was “not necessary”. Analysts said the tour was a sop to European governments wavering on ratifying a trade deal between the EU and the South American trade block Mercosur. Amazon deforestation and fires have accelerated since Jair Bolsonaro took office as Brazil’s president in January 2019 with an anti-environmental agenda, promising to develop the region. “Governments in favour of ratification want Brazil to do things like that in order to help them to make a case … back in their capitals,” said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a São Paulo business school. Others feared they had fallen into a propaganda trap as an official government Twitter account falsely tweeted that Brazil protected its environment more than anywhere else, and Bolsonaro’s claim that “shady interests” coveted Amazon riches. Many of the claims were debunked by the environmental factchecking site fakebook.eco. First mooted by Bolsonaro a year ago and organised after eight European countries, including the UK, in September urged Brazil to take “real action” over deforestation, the trip concentrated on the Amazon city of Manaus and the rainforest’s better protected northern region. It included a zoo, a deforestation monitoring centre, a sustainable farm and the confluence of the Amazon and Negro rivers near Manaus, a major tourist point. On Friday, ambassadors visited a military base in the Yanomami indigenous reserve and an indigenous health centre in the remote town of São Gabriel da Cachoeira. Greenpeace delivered an alternative route to ambassadors taking part before the trip began, suggesting they visit devastated areas such as the Jamanxim forest in Pará state. “I hope the ambassadors clearly understand this is nothing more than media propaganda that does not represent reality,” said Cristiane Mazzetti, an Amazon campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil. Before setting off, the UK’s acting ambassador in Brazil, Liz Davidson, tweeted that “it is a shame the trip does not include visits to areas more impacted by environmental degradation”. She told Brazil’s Valor Econômico daily that the UK wanted to see a long-term plan to combat illegal deforestation. In a last minute deviation from the official route, the ambassadors were due to fly over the BR-163 highway in Pará – the region suggested by Greenpeace – which cuts through heavily deforested Amazon forest, the G1 site reported. There were no plans to land. “We looked to fly over the BR-163 region … we weren’t able to because there was cloud cover in spite of flying low, but it is important to make clear that taking them in loco is not really necessary,” Mourão told reporters in Manaus, according to the city’s A Critica site. He heads an army operation to combat fires and deforestation widely derided as ineffective. Bolsonaro’s government has dismantled environmental protections. Environmental officials have been sacked, banned from talking to the media and forbidden to burn and destroy tractors and other equipment used by illegal loggers and miners. Deforestation hit a 10-year high between August 2018 and July 2019, reaching 10,129 sq kms, and indications are that the next figures, due next month, will be even higher. Fires in the Amazon also hit a 10-year high, rising 13% in the first nine months of 2020. Bolsonaro falsely claimed in a speech to the United Nations that the rainforest did not burn, blaming indigenous people and a “disinformation campaign anchored on shady interests” for negative media coverage. In April the environment minister, Ricardo Salles – who was also on this week’s trip – called for more deregulation while media was distracted by the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday the Climate Observatory said Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions rose by 9.6% in 2019. It said 2.2bn tons of carbon dioxide was released, driven by Amazon deforestation and making it impossible for Brazil to meet its 2020 emissions target."
"I’m sitting by a pond with musician Cosmo Sheldrake, wearing a pair of headphones that are attached to a large, fluffy microphone a few feet away. An obstacle course of wires surrounds us and there are two more microphones hidden in a bush by a bird feeder. It looks like lockdown’s answer to a silent disco, but far from being engrossed in techno music we’re soaking up natural sounds performed by the birds of the dawn chorus. This is how Sheldrake has started many mornings since the Covid-19 pandemic began, in an off-grid cottage hidden in woods outside the New Forest near Fordingbridge in Hampshire. He has just made an album of avian conversations called Wake Up Calls and today he is showing me how he makes his wild recordings. I arrive at 6.30am to hear the moment howling owls sign off and pass over to songbirds making their morning announcements. Through the headphones, drizzle on the water sounds like a monsoon and a screeching blackbird sounds as if it’s sitting on my shoulder. Listening to the plucky protagonist is a reminder that this morning ritual is a fight for survival – males are serenading females but also warning others to keep off their patch. The Good Life is not all about joie de vivre. The whitewashed cottage belongs to Sheldrake’s girlfriend’s mother and when she started renting it 36 years ago there was a tree growing through the kitchen. The week before my visit an oak nearly crushed the shepherd’s hut (transformed into an office). Sheldrake is as eccentric as you’d expect, given that he is the son of the maverick biologist Rupert, and brother to fungi expert Merlin. Musically, he is most influenced by his mother, Jill Purce, who teaches and practises Mongolian overtone chanting. On the walls inside the cottage is a kaleidoscope of paintings, mainly depicting views from around the house (his girlfriend’s mother is the artist Lizzie Wallace). Sheldrake, who is normally London-based, doesn’t drive so it’s convenient that his source of inspiration comes from the woods hugging the house. These paintings are a visual reflection of the landscape, while Sheldrake’s album is a reflection of the noises it makes. His studio-cum-field-station is a metre from a bird feeder. Inside the studio is a bed, an armchair and a scruffy collection of boxes. He puts the sound recordings into his computer and slows down individual calls. It’s like intercepting morse code, revealing delicate cadences you don’t hear when the songs are rattled out at speed. The blackbird is a guttural, gritty character, while the robin’s voice has bell-like purity. “Birds live on a different time axis,” says 30-year-old Sheldrake. “There’s a spectrum of relationships with time – we look at birds and think they’re very ‘other’, but when you slow their song down, you get an idea of the tapestry of what they’re saying and they sound strangely human. These are very subtle, integrated phrases that we miss when they’re singing at their normal speed.” And so these little characters and conversations have been pieced together in an album that follows the natural acoustics of the day; it starts with a nightjar, which sings just after dusk and through the night, then goes to a nightingale, and then the dawn chorus, before working its way through the day. A chord can be composed of five or six different aspects of a song played simultaneously. Tracks are based on sounds that already exist and have their own identity and character. “It’s a collaboration,” says Sheldrake, “except without explicit consent from the birds.” At first, Sheldrake made songs as Christmas presents for friends and family to use as alarm clocks. People who got them then found they couldn’t sleep through the actual dawn chorus because they had tuned into it. Sheldrake wanted more people to be conscious of bird sounds so he decided to make an album.  “Once you can identify them as species or individuals, it just turns into this completely insane conversation across huge amounts of time and space,” says Sheldrake. “You have these themes essentially rippling through the woods. Everything that happens in a woodland is like a stone dropping into a pond. It sends out these ripples as those birds respond and then respond to those responses … there are so many layers and levels to it,” he says. Part of his aim is to highlight how we may not be conscious of the loss of wildlife from our lives. Many of the birds featured on his album, such as marsh warbler, mistle thrush and dunnock, are no longer a ubiquitous part of our soundscapes. The star performers from today’s chorus – blackbirds and robins – didn’t make it on to Sheldrake’s album because they are not (yet) on the red or amber list of endangered British birds. We go on a sonic field trip in the forest around the house, walking through old plantations – the beech woodland, with its dark canopy and little plant growth on the forest floor, sounds like a cathedral. Sheldrake describes it as a “slow, crashing surf sound, like an ocean”. The ash – blighted with dieback – has little canopy to hold sound in. Poplars have a “rushing, sucking sound”. Within these forest environments, sound is a critical method of communication. Birds have evolved acoustic as well as physical niches – and they use different frequencies and rhythms so they can still identify individuals. Historically, the sonic landscape has been underrepresented in research, but a new wave of acoustic ecologists are paying more attention to sound, led by the US musician and soundscape ecologist Dr Bernie Krause. Listening to the voices of the natural world propels that experience into another dimension, says Krause. “It’s important to heighten our awareness of natural soundscapes and, in particular, ‘biophonies’ [the name Krause gives to sounds collectively produced by wildlife], because they convey a sense of place,” he says. “The narratives are the origins of our music and language. They speak to the health of a habitat. They tell us how we’re doing in relationship to our environment. And they can serve as analgesics in these unsettling and stressful times.” As well as raising awareness about loss of natural sounds, Sheldrake has always liked the idea of “playing places” – playing songs back to the place they came from. He didn’t know this could potentially be beneficial until he looked at the work of Prof Steve Simpson from the University of Exeter on “sonic enrichment”, in which the sounds of healthy ocean reefs are played into degraded areas in order to attract life back to them. According to research published in Nature Communications last year, playing the sound of a healthy reef into a degraded and abandoned one can lure fish back to the area. Blasting “golden oldies” back on to a reef is like “putting it on steroids”, says Simpson. It’s not known whether a similar approach might work with birds. Krause believes that playing bird sounds back into a habitat risks stressing out organisms that have already carved out an acoustic niche for themselves. Sheldrake describes it as a “romantic ideal”, and half-hopes he might lure a passing cuckoo. For most people, the sounds in Sheldrake’s album are already noises from a more bird-rich past. The UK has lost 90% of its nightingales in 50 years, and more than 55% of skylarks and cuckoos. There are now only 80 breeding male  bitterns left. The album is a celebration of sound but also a warning of the beauty we’re losing.

"Coloradans have voted to reintroduce wolves, which were hunted and trapped to extinction in the 1940s, to the state by 2023. The proposition squeaked by with 50.4% of the total votes as of Thursday night. This is the first time American voters have ever weighed in on reintroducing a wildlife species, as that decision is usually left up to a state’s team of wildlife biologists. Gray wolves once roamed across two-thirds of the continental US. Without wolves at the top of the food chain, the whole ecosystem is out of balance, says Eric Washburn, a campaign manager at the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund, the advocacy group behind the proposition. Yellowstone national park reintroduced gray wolves to the park in 1995, and Washburn looks to it as a living laboratory and model for Colorado’s reintroduction plans. The return of the region’s apex predators set off a cascade of natural events that ultimately restored Yellowstone’s “ecological integrity”, says Washburn, and the reintroduction is hailed as one of the world’s greatest rewilding stories. Wolves were first listed as endangered 45 years ago, when the population dropped to 1,000 individuals in the continental 48 states. Now it sits at about 6,000. Colorado’s decision is complicated by the fact that just last week, the Trump administration delisted gray wolves from the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) after announcing the species’ “successful recovery”. Hundreds of biologists dispute this, in part because wolves still only occupy a sliver of their historic range. States will now decide if wolves can be hunted or trapped. And since wildlife cannot recognize state lines, wolves can move in and out of states where they can be killed, thwarting conservation efforts. For example, the gray wolf is endangered in Colorado but only threatened in Wyoming, where wolves can be killed on sight in 85% of the state. Last year, at least three wolves from north-west Colorado were killed when they moved into Wyoming. “We do worry about that, but there’s not a whole lot we can do about that because wolves will go where they see habitat,” said Washburn. “But the good news is, there’s 17m acres of public land habitat in western Colorado.”  Washburn also hopes that the decision to delist wolves from the Endangered Species Act will be overturned by a federal court."
"The government’s conservation watchdog has been “cut to the bone”, with staff underpaid, undervalued and overworked and feeling unable to protect England’s most valuable wildlife sites, according to a new report and testimony from workers. Natural England, which is sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), has a range of responsibilities, including monitoring and protecting the country’s most valuable habitats such as sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) and national nature reserves (NNRs). It also works with farmers to protect biodiversity and advises the government on environmental policy, planning and licensing. Defra’s funding for the agency has dropped by £165m since 2008, and as a result it is struggling to carry out these statutory duties, according to Prospect trade union’s Natural England 2020-21 report. “There’s a certain weirdness to working in Natural England in that everyone knows that we’ve been absolutely cut to the bone,” one employee told the Guardian. “Everyone knows we can’t do basic statutory stuff, let alone the bigger, exciting projects we want to do.” Following a decade of cuts, this year the agency was awarded an additional £15m to recruit around 200 new staff, including roles to help deliver the Environment bill legislation going through parliament. While the report welcomes this investment, it calls it a “drop in the ocean” and warns that “urgent, radical investment is needed”. “Public awareness of the plight of biodiversity and fragility of our landscapes has finally come to the fore … but it is clear from the trajectory of both funding, pay and staff numbers that to meet the ambitions and challenges set out in this report, and to not let the green recovery fall flat, government must step up and make good the damage done,” the report says. Natural England’s “lack of money is affecting everybody because it is the paymaster for a lot of local nature conservation efforts – it’s the spider in the middle of the web,” said author and conservationist Peter Marren. “I don’t think most people have ever heard of Natural England, it’s not a high-profile public body. This is happening because nobody cares about it … apart from the tight circle that work in nature conservation.” Natural England teams are increasingly being centralised in small regional hubs due to staff shortages. Management of SSSIs – which cover 8% of England – is mostly dealt with remotely, by email and phone. Previously, one person would manage 10-15 SSSIs, now they have up to 40. More than 60% of SSSI sites are in “unfavourable” condition, and half of them haven’t been monitored in six years, which is a statutory duty, meaning the reality could be worse. Pay has been an ongoing issue at Natural England. Last year staff were in their eighth year of a 1% cap on pay, which has since been lifted. Only 9.5% of staff believe their pay adequately reflects their performance and the gender pay gap across the agency is 8.4%. One employee, who left last summer, told the Guardian she was earning £20,000 for four days a week and worked two extra jobs to make ends meet. She had been working for a decade before joining the agency and had two first-class degrees from Oxbridge. When she raised the pay issue with her manager she said she was told, “it’s normal for people in Natural England to have second and third jobs to get by”. She described working at the agency as stressful: “Natural England staff are the medics of the environment and they are watching their charges – the environment, species, habitats – going extinct and rotten every day. The grief and trauma of working in the natural environment in this country is intense. In Natural England it’s a nightmare.” This week staff were planning to strike over pay issues. In response, Natural England set up a pay reform project and union leaders have given the agency six months before it will consider industrial action again. A union representative told the Guardian; “It’s hurtful that we’re not valued like our counterparts in Defra. Our work is technical, specialist and high risk, but not properly recognised by the government and yet it depends on us for advice. It’s a plea, really, for the government to recognise the vital work that Natural England does for nature and people.” Public sector investment in conservation has fallen in real terms by 33% in five years, according to the 2020 biodiversity indicators report. Natural England chair Tony Juniper has previously said that ongoing budget cuts have left the organisation “massively depleted”, and he has been lobbying for more funding. Mike Clancy, Prospect union general secretary, said there was a “yawning gap” between the government’s rhetoric on climate change and biodiversity, and the reality of years of underfunding environmental agencies. “Protecting nature means investing in the people who do that work,” he said. “Natural England is at the heart of this agenda but it can only be effective if it is properly funded and the importance of its staff properly recognised.” Natural England has an “absolutely critical job” in turning around catastrophic wildlife decline, said Craig Bennett, chief executive of Wildlife Trusts. “If our nation is to have the natural world that we yearn for, then ministers need to give Natural England the money and powers it needs to do its job, and let it get on with it.” Green party peer Natalie Bennett said people protecting nature are doing so “on a shoestring” due to the severity of cuts. “We’re one of the world’s most nature-depleted countries, yet Natural England has been under-resourced at every turn and this threatens the work of its expert staff … clearly funding needs to be restored.” Marian Spain, chief executive of Natural England, said the agency is embarking on a nature recovery network, rebuilding resilient landscapes, restoring wildlife, improving soil health, and helping people to connect to the natural world. “Our staff do an extraordinary job in caring for the natural world and we are committed to making sure they are rewarded fairly for their hard work,” she said in the comment, which came via Defra. “This government has set out ambitious environmental targets, which Natural England is well placed to deliver on – however ongoing and significant investment will be needed if we are to truly realise the ambition of leaving the environment in a better state than we found it.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"The world’s largest mink producer, Denmark, says it plans to cull more than 15 million of the animals, due to fears that a Covid-19 mutation moving from mink to humans could jeopardise future vaccines. At a press conference on Wednesday, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said 12 people are already infected with the mutated virus and that the mink are now considered a public health risk. “The mutated virus in mink may pose a risk to the effectiveness of a future vaccine,” Frederiksen said. She said the army, police, and national emergency service would be mobilised to help farms with the mink cull, which will eradicate the entire Danish herd. The authorities and breeders have already been culling the animals over the past few weeks in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19. Reuters reported that Denmark’s health minister said about half of 783 infected people in northern Denmark, home to a large number of mink breeders, had been found to have infections stemming from the farms. Denmark is the world’s largest producer of mink fur and has 15 to 17 million animals on about 1,100 farms. According to reports, the latest figures from the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, say Covid-19 infections have been found on more than 200 mink farms. The figures were confirmed by a Danish police press officer. Finnish fur auctioneer Magnus Ljung, CEO of Saga Furs, was watching the Danish announcement. “It’s a shock. They will kill all mink in Denmark. They are talking about the risk of Covid-19 mutating in the mink, and going from mink to humans, and potentially affecting a future human vaccine.” Ljung estimated the value of the 2020 mink population in Denmark to be between €350m and €400m (£270m-£360m). “They got control of [Covid-19 mink infections] in Holland and there were a few cases in Spain and in Sweden. But it was all kept under control. [The Danish cull] is unexpected, for sure. Yes, it could happen in other countries. But I don’t want to speculate,” said Ljung. “What we really need to do is end mink farming entirely and retrain the farmers,” said Birgitte Damm, policy adviser and vet with NGO Animal Protection Denmark. Speaking from Amsterdam, Dr Joanna Swabe, Humane Society International/Europe’s senior director of public affairs, said: “Denmark is one of the largest fur producers on the planet, so a total shutdown of all Danish mink fur farms amid spiralling Covid-19 infections is a significant development. “Although not a ban on fur farming, this move signals the end of suffering for millions of animals confined to small wire cages on Danish fur farms solely for the purposes of a trivial fur fashion that no one needs. We commend the Danish prime minister on her decision to take such an essential and science-led step to protect Danish citizens from the deadly coronavirus.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"A powerful coalition of the UK’s health professions has called for a climate tax to be imposed on food with a heavy environmental impact by 2025, unless the industry takes voluntary action on the impact of their products. The group says the climate crisis cannot be solved without action to cut the consumption of food that causes high emissions, such as red meat and dairy products. But it says that more sustainable diets are also healthier and would reduce illness. The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change (UKHACC) includes 10 Royal Colleges of medicine and nursing, the British Medical Association and the Lancet, representing the doctors, nurses and other professionals entrusted with caring for the country’s health. The alliance’s new report makes a series of recommendations including a swift end to buy-one-get-one-free offers for food that is bad for health and the environment, and for perishable foods that are often wasted. It also calls for public information campaigns on diet to include climate messages, for labels on food to reveal its environmental impact, and for the £2bn spent every year on catering in schools, hospitals, care homes and prisons to meet minimum environmental standards. A YouGov poll of healthcare professionals for UKHACC found two-thirds agreeing that environmentally friendly diets can also improve your health, while 40% had already changed their own eating habits due to environmental concerns. Food production is responsible for a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and a series of scientific studies have shown that red meat and dairy have far bigger impacts than plant-based food. People in rich nations already eat more meat than is healthy and in the UK only one in three eat the recommended five daily portions of fruit and vegetables. “We can’t reach our goals without addressing our food system,” said Kristin Bash, who leads the Faculty of Public Health’s food group and was a co-author of the UKHACC report. “The climate crisis isn’t something we should see as far in the future. It’s time to take these issues seriously now.” Bash said the report was not telling people to become vegans: “It’s just saying increase your consumption of plant protein. It’s a simple message and something that’s widely supported by health organisations around the world.” Nicky Philpott, the director of UKHACC, said taxes on plastic bags and sugary soft drinks had shown such policies can reduce harmful activities. The report said the government should state an intention to levy a food carbon tax on all food producers if voluntary action on the full climate impact of food products is not taken by the industry by 2025. Marco Springmann, at the University of Oxford and not involved in the report, said there was substantial scientific evidence on the close connection between public and planetary health: “The message is clear: without drastic reduction in the production and consumption of meat and dairy, there is little chance of avoiding dangerous levels of climate change.” “UKHACC is right in stressing that dietary changes of the scale required will not happen without strong policy support,” he said. Henry Dimbleby, who leads the independent group developing England’s National Food Strategy, said: “Covid-19, painful though it is, could pale into insignificance compared to the turbulence created by climate change and the collapse in biodiversity. Healthcare professionals have an important role in shaping our diets, and I am very pleased to see their recommendations cover not only our health, but that of our planet too.” Some action is already happening in the UK to cut the environmental impact of food. In April, public sector caterers serving billions of meals a year pledged to reduce the amount of meat they serve by 20%, cutting 9m kg of meat a year. In October, the NHS set a target of cutting its net carbon emissions to zero by 2040 and included food in its action plan: “Healthier, locally sourced food can improve wellbeing while cutting emissions.” Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, said UKHACC’s recommendation of environmental labelling on food was important. “Today you can walk into a shop and buy something with an environmental impact many times higher than another food, and have no idea you have done so.” For example, Brazilian beef uses 200 times more land and causes 80 times more emissions than European tofu, he said. Prof Andrew Goddard, the president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: “I am the first to admit that I enjoy a steak every now and then, but it’s clear that if we are to avoid dangerous global warming we must start to reconsider our attitudes to food. We each have a responsibility and an ability to make a difference as individuals.”"
"The tall pines, oaks and birches shake in the wind, sounding like waves crashing on the shore. Small white clouds sail rapidly across the blue sky. I follow the path that winds down through the wood, passing fungi in the decaying vegetation, including sprouting yellow clumps of sulphur tuft and little purple domes of amethyst deceiver. The low sun gleams through the trunks and on to the brown, curling ferns as I approach the edge of the woods and look out across the flat brooks. Canada and greylag geese honk and feed on the grass, lapwings stand to attention or hoot and whistle in loops above the water. A single acorn sits on the flat metal top of a post of a nearby fence. As I wonder how it got there, a jay flies squawking out of the trees and lands on the post. It carefully places another acorn beside the first, and then returns to the wood. About five minutes later it comes back and deposits a third acorn, which it lines up beside the first two, in a row. After a pause, the jay picks up one of the acorns in its beak and jumps down, on to the ground. I can just make out its head moving up and down in the long grass, burying the acorn. After a few minutes, the jay flies up to the post and picks up a second acorn. It turns its head from side to side, eyeing the final nut. It flips its beak up, so the one it’s holding falls down in its crop, and picks up the last acorn. It flies back to the ground. There’s a commotion over the brooks – the lapwings are more agitated than normal and flocks of starlings swirl, rising and falling in spirals of black dots over the grass. An arrow-like merlin cuts through the birds, speeding low and out of sight. I watch for the small brown falcon, and finally it reappears and glides up to land on a fence post. The merlin slowly turns her head, almost in a full circle, to watch the settling birds around her. Then she leaps forward into the air and is gone. The starlings rise up in black clouds again. "
"As parts of northern England were covered in frost, Hamish – the first polar bear to be born in the UK in 25 years – embarked on a 400-mile journey to his new home. The cub, who has shared an enclosure with his mother, Victoria, in the Scottish Highlands for the past two and a half years, was transported to Yorkshire on Wednesday. Hamish was born in December 2017 at Highland Wildlife Park, near Aviemore, and his name was chosen through a public vote. Since his birth thousands of people have visited the park to catch a glimpse of him. However, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) had always planned to move him to another zoo once he was old enough to leave his mother. Earlier this year the wildlife conservation charity announced that he would be moving to Yorkshire Wildlife Park’s Project Polar habitat following a recommendation from the European Endangered Species Programme. Rachel Williams, senior animal keeper at Highland Wildlife Park, said it was a natural time for the playful cub to move on but that he would be missed, although his mother would finally get to enjoy some quiet time. “In the wild, polar bear cubs will stay with their mothers for two to three years, so this is a natural time for Hamish to be moving on,” she said. She added: “It has been an incredible two and a half years watching him grow and he will be missed by everyone here at the park. “[But] we’re sure Victoria will appreciate some peace and quiet before any next steps in the breeding programme.” Hamish’s father, Arktos, remains in an enclosure in another part of the Scottish park. Williams said Victoria and Arktos could be “paired up” again next year. David Field, RZSS’s chief executive, said Hamish had been an incredible ambassador for his relatives in the wild, playing a crucial role in educating the public about threats faced by many species. “A critical part of our role as a wildlife conservation charity is education. Hamish has made a tremendous impression on the thousands of people who visited the park since his birth two and a half years ago, and the billions who saw the news around the world,” he said. He added: “He has helped to highlight the threats many species face in the wild and the changes we can undertake to really make a difference. “Changes in the Arctic climate mean the sea ice that wild polar bears, and other animals, depend on for survival is shrinking and it is predicted this will significantly decrease population numbers over the next 40 years.” Hamish made the seven-hour journey to Doncaster by road. Yorkshire Wildlife Park’s head of animals, Dr Matt Hartley, said: “We are delighted to be welcoming Hamish to Project Polar where he will join our other male bears. “Our expansive reserves allow social interaction, play, exploration and behavioural development that is vital for bear wellbeing.”"
"Police are investigating I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! over concerns non-native wildlife could have escaped into the Welsh countryside during bushtucker trials, the Guardian can reveal. Rural crime officers from north Wales police are looking into complaints that non-native creatures such as cockroaches, maggots, spiders and worms could threaten wildlife in the 100-hectare (250-acre) estate surrounding Gwrych Castle in north Wales, where the show is being held this year. Normally, the show is hosted live from the Australian jungle, where celebrity contestants take part in dares and challenges with live animals, like being covered in insects or surrounded by rats. Authorities are investigating ITV after complaints by the TV presenter and naturalist Iolo Williams, who was appalled after watching the show last week and seeing thousands of cockroaches being poured over contestants. He described it as “madness” to use non-native species for entertainment. “I’m not sure which species they’re releasing, but I can tell you they’re not native. We don’t have those cockroaches here in the UK and we certainly don’t have them in north Wales,” he said. Although the challenge happens in a contained environment, contestants would still be carrying insects when they left the enclosure, said Williams. “There are going to be cockroaches in every nook and cranny along their bodies, you’re going to tell me that every single one of those is found immediately? Of course it’s not.” ITV said all of the insects used on I’m A Celebrity were non-invasive species, but declined to comment on which species were used. A spokesperson said: “They are only ever released in a contained area and collected immediately after filming. They are all purchased commercially within the UK and are normally bred as animal food.” While not all non-native species are invasive, some can permanently change ecosystems and are one of the five main drivers of biodiversity decline, according to the UN. Gwrych Castle woods is a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), meaning it is home to some of the country’s rarest species or habitats. Half a kilometre away from the castle is another SSSI managed by the Woodland Trust, called Coed y Gopa, an ancient woodland home to ospreys and goshawks. The Springwatch presenter said it was particularly ridiculous considering it has so far been impossible to release beavers in Wales – even though they used to be a native species. Williams said: “Cockroaches are the ultimate survivors, and if they survive in north Wales and escape into the wild there, what effect are they going to have? I don’t know, nobody knows … I just find it incredible that they’re allowed to do this, and I’m not being a killjoy here. Why not use fish guts, or offal?” Natural Resources Wales, which gives out licences for the release of species, did not receive an application from ITV to release non-native species. If these species have been released without a licence it would be a breach of the Wildlife and Countryside Act. A spokesperson for north Wales police said: “The matter is being investigated by officers from our rural crime team.” Invasive species that are now established in the UK include the non-native fungus that causes ash dieback, and signal crayfish that transmit disease to native crayfish. There are an estimated 2,000 non-native species established in the UK, at an annual cost of £1.8bn to the economy, according to the environment audit committee. I’m a Celebrity has also faced complaints from the RSPCA. Last week the charity raised “serious concerns” about the welfare of animals being dropped, handled roughly and crushed by contestants on the show. It is concerned viewers may try to copy bushtucker trials at home, during which animals have been killed “for no other purpose than entertainment”. “We feel that deliberately portraying certain species as nasty or frightening or as objects that can be used purely for entertainment rather than sentient, living creatures sends out totally the wrong message,” the charity said in a post on its website. ITV said the programme “complies with animal welfare law concerning the use of animals, and we are proud of our exemplary production practices”.

"Governments across Europe are failing to protect their citizens from toxic air pollution, with most Europeans still breathing filthy air in their cities, according to data. Pollutants from farming, domestic heating and vehicles are beyond the levels needed to ensure breathable air within World Health Organization guidelines, despite EU legislation, government pledges and years of campaigning. Only Ireland, Iceland, Finland and Estonia showed levels of fine particulate matter – one of the most dangerous forms of air pollution – that were below the WHO guidelines in 2018, according to data released on Monday by the European Environment Agency. Exposure to such pollution caused about 417,000 premature deaths across Europe – including non-EU member states – in 2018. Hans Bruyninckx, the executive director of the EEA, Europe’s environmental watchdog, said: “[Our] data prove that investing in better air quality is an investment for better health and productivity for all Europeans. Policies and actions that are consistent with Europe’s zero pollution ambition lead to longer and healthier lives and more resilient societies.” There have been some improvements, but they fall short of the actions needed from governments. The EEA found that 60,000 fewer people died prematurely in 2018 than in 2009 from fine particulate matter pollution. There may also have been health improvements owing to the coronavirus lockdowns this year, the EEA noted, but further work is required to assess the full impacts. The watchdog said its preliminary data showed there were reductions of as much as 60% in air pollution this spring, confirming other findings. Studies have found links between high air pollution and increased harm from Covid-19, underlining the need to reduce air pollution. Green campaigners said governments must act urgently. Margherita Tolotto, the senior policy officer at the European Environmental Bureau, which represents campaigning groups across the EU, said: “How many wake-up calls do government officials need to take on air pollution? Their delay is costing us our health and a safe environment. They know what needs to be done to improve air quality: cleaner energy and industrial production, greener and smarter transport, and sustainable farming.” Emissions of pollutants from vehicles have fallen, though not to the extent required, and emissions from power plants have also tumbled as Europe has moved away from coal power. But cutting emissions from domestic heating, including wood-burning, and from agriculture – including ammonia from manure and fertilisers, which combines with other pollutants in the air to form particulate matter – has proved more of a challenge. Governments had failed to meet EU targets, the EEA said. Under EU rules, every member state should have submitted a plan for bringing air pollution within health limits in 2018. However, Italy’s plan is still at draft stage, while Greece, Luxembourg and Romania have yet to submit any plan. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU’s environment commissioner, said progress had been made but called on member states to do more, and promised an action plan as part of the European Green Deal. “It is good news that air quality is improving thanks to the environmental and climate policies we have been implementing,” he said. “But we can’t ignore the downside – the number of premature deaths due to air pollution is still far too high. With the European Green Deal we have set ourselves an ambition of reducing all kinds of pollution to zero. If we are to succeed and fully protect people’s health and the environment, we need to cut air pollution further and align our air quality standards more closely with the recommendations of the WHO.” Six member states – Italy, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and the Czech Republic – breached the EU’s limits for fine particulate matter, called PM2.5, in 2018. The EU limits are less stringent than WHO guidelines. There were 54,000 premature deaths from nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2018 in the EU-28, which includes the UK, which was then still a member of the EU. Ground-level ozone caused about 19,000 premature deaths in the EU-28 that year. The UK government has pledged to bring in new guidelines on air pollution to replace its targets under the EU. The framework legislation for these targets is contained in the environment bill, going through the committee stage in parliament after a long delay. Any new targets will not be set until late 2022 at the earliest, however, after a consultation. The UK government was repeatedly found in court cases over several years to have breached EU air pollution limits and ministers were ordered by supreme court judges to come forward with plans for reducing air pollution that would meet the targets."
"The high-end French fashion brand Hermès wants to build one of Australia’s biggest crocodile farms in the Northern Territory that would hold up to 50,000 saltwater crocodiles to be turned into luxury goods such as handbags and shoes. But the proposal has come under fire from animal welfare groups, who say other fashion brands have moved away from using exotic animal skins on cruelty grounds. Advocates told Guardian Australia they had concerns about the welfare of the crocodiles, and that farming animals for luxury goods was “no longer fashionable.” The territory, a significant global supplier of crocodile skins, is already home to several crocodile farms owned by major fashion brands. Northern Territory crocodile industry figure Mick Burns is leading the proposal on a former fruit farm near Darwin purchased earlier this year by the company PRI Farming, of which he is a director. The NT government has already granted development approval for the project, with documents showing the farm would include an egg incubator laboratory, a hatchery, and growing pens, as well as wastewater treatment plants and a solar farm. According to documents submitted to the territory’s Environmental Protection Authority, the farm would employ 30 people and build from an initial 4,000 crocodiles to 50,000, which the ABC has reported would make it one of the biggest crocodile farms in Australia. An EPA statement to the Guardian said the project had been granted environmental approval, and that PRI had also indicated it would apply for a wildlife trade permit. Dr Jed Goodfellow, a senior policy officer at RSPCA Australia, said the society remained opposed to killing of any animal “where the purpose of their death is primarily to produce a non-essential luxury item like fur or skin”. He said the society was not aware of the details of animal welfare practices on the planned farm. But he said generally there were many welfare risks raised by crocodile farming in intensive conditions, “including injuries from close confinement, small individual penning arrangements, and the impacts of restraint and slaughter methods”. He said Australia’s national code of practice covering crocodile farming was “now over 10 years old and in need of review”. Nicola Beynon, of Humane Society International, said brands including Chanel, Mulberry and the owners of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger had adopted animal welfare policies “against using exotic animal skins such as crocodile”. “Consumers and fashion houses are walking away from animal cruelty as fast as they can,” she said. “It seems foolish to be investing in an industry that is no longer fashionable.” A 2017 report commissioned from Ernst & Young by the NT government estimated the crocodile farming industry was worth $106m to the territory’s economy. It said NT’s crocodile skin producers “are known as ethical providers and have encouraged high-end fashion producers such as Hermès and Louis Vuitton to purchase local NT farms to secure their supply chain”. The report said crocodile eggs were harvested under licence from the wild, with juvenile crocodiles “nurtured to minimise stress and protect their skins”. The report said: “Finally, the premium end product, crocodile skins, then often ends up as some of the world’s most expensive and sought-after fashion accessories (handbags, shoes, purses and wallets) being worn in the finest establishments throughout the world with key markets in the United States and Europe.” Documents with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission show PRI Farming is wholly owned by another Darwin-based company, which in turn is wholly owned by Hermès. Burns did not respond to a request for comment. Guardian Australia sent questions to Hermès and asked to speak to a representative, but did not get a response. A 2019 corporate social responsibility report from Hermès said the company owned three crocodile farms and “two hide processing and inspection sites” in Australia.  The report said all the company’s crocodile farms were signed up to a best practices charter, and the company had worked across the industry to improve animal welfare standards which had been reviewed by a crocodile group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Hermès has an animal welfare policy which states: “The group has defined and implemented a very strict, science-based, animal welfare policy. This applies within its direct sphere of responsibility as well as for its external partners, with a specific supply-chain based approach.” In 2015, Burns helped the Northern Territory government develop a strategy to expand the region’s crocodile farming industry. That report said that in 2015 that Australia accounted for 60% of world trade in saltwater crocodile skins, with the territory responsible for two thirds of traded skins. Prof Grahame Webb, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature crocodile specialist group, told the Guardian crocodile farming had helped fund conservation efforts in the region. Webb said fashion houses had been “mercilessly attacked” by animal rights activists, but he said the companies had a “good story to tell”. “[Those companies] have to get more and more control over their supply chain so that they can guarantee the highest standards. “Hermès is a very conservative company – it’s them trying to do the right thing. Australia has an excellent reputation for its crocodile management program worldwide.” Webb said the scale of the new proposal from Burns suggested it would be able to produce about 15,000 crocodile skins a year. The harvesting of eggs from the wild population was sustainable, he said. Unregulated hunting of crocodiles in Australia drove numbers dangerously low until rules protecting them were introduced in the early 1970s, Webb has written. He said the number of saltwater crocodiles in the wild was now healthy and stable. “Our wild populations are full,” he said."
"When Newcastle city council planned to reduce motorist access to Acorn Road in the leafy suburb of Jesmond back in 2014, hardware store owner Steve Robson helped to raise a petition against the £350,000 scheme, organised meetings to oppose the plans and told a local newspaper that the proposed changes would be “devastating”. The changes went ahead. And to date, Acorn Road has not been devastated. Far from it. Robson’s hardware shop – trading from the same small premises since 1912 – is doing so well that last month it expanded into an adjacent shop, doubling its floor space. “I’ve been happy with the changes made to the street,” says Robson. The campaign against the changes was ferocious. “We do not mind change to bring the area into the 21st century,” Robson said at the time, “but we don’t want to lose any of our parking spaces.” Council officers tweaked the scheme, but in the end much of the street makeover went ahead, including widened pavements, a contraflow for cyclists and the addition of a cyclist-only traffic light triggered by sensors. It had been a two-way street, with rush hour snarl-ups and the odd contretemps. Now motorists can drive – slowly – only one way. Bollards blotted out several parking spaces; concrete planters and double yellow lines replaced others. “Since the changes, Acorn Road has become more vibrant,” Robson says now. “With bike racks nearby, we get more cyclists coming in.” In fact, if he was given the job of Jesmond’s transport planner, the Robson of today would be a touch more radical than the Robson of 2014. “I’d like to see seats and tables to give a sort of holiday feel.” He would even widen the pavements more. So was his prediction that the changes would lead to the “death of Acorn Road” wrong? Robson laughs, and admits that yes, he got it completely wrong. Heather Stronach was killed by a lorry driver on 2 November when cycling on Edinburgh’s Portobello High Street. The 36-year-old was the second cyclist to die at the same location within 20 months. When Edinburgh’s transport and environment committee met to discuss a new LTN for an area in the city, both deaths were raised. “We need a safer environment for those most at risk on our roads,” urged committee leader Lesley Macinnes. “We have to reflect as a city where our priorities lie, and they have to lie with vulnerable road users.” But while Conservative councillors agreed with the sentiment, they continued to object and for the second time in as many months the committee was forced to refer the proposal to the full council. It’s yet more delay for a plan that has so far split the community. Introduced in August as a temporary measure to encourage cycling and walking during the pandemic, the LTN scheme for East Craigs met with immediate opposition. An anti-LTN group – Get Edinburgh Moving (Gem) – crowdfunded a legal opinion which suggested the LTN was “unlawful”. Gem chair David Hunter argued that, unlike elsewhere in Edinburgh, East Craigs has had no cyclist or pedestrian fatalities, does not suffer from rat-runs, and therefore does not need an LTN. Back in August, the SNP’s Macinnes had promised that the East Craigs LTN would “create safe, people-friendly streets”.  The scheme is likely to get full council approval eventually, but will have to go out to public consultation, yet again kicking the can down the (still open) road. Hunter told the Guardian: “East Craigs is already low traffic. The congestion problems are on the surrounding arterial routes.” Without the legal challenge “this hated and unnecessary LTN would have been imposed on the local community against its will”. But Janis Ross-Williamson, one of many local campaigners in favour of the LTN, was incredibly disappointed. She says that many roads in the area are “extremely busy” and there are problems with rat-runs and speeding. “I’ve lived here for 18 years, and the traffic has increased dramatically.” She hopes there will be some form of traffic reduction in the end, which will mean “quieter, safer streets for all of us. When it’s there and some start to use it for more active travel then more people are likely to change their habits and see the benefits of the scheme … at least that is my hope for the community.” Victoria Clasen delivers her flowers by bike. And for her Brixton-based flower delivery service Pop Florist, trade has been brisk since the LTN went in. “My sales increased, and my business has been busier than ever.” Riding along Railton Road on her Urban Arrow e-cargobike, she is a rolling advert for a greener future: “When you see a bike like mine, filled with flowers, even the most steely, cantankerous Grinch will smile, because it’s a business that spreads joy. “People recognise it’s a sustainable way of doing business, and it’s the way that all of us need to start thinking about getting around – we need to drive less, and LTNs can massively improve air quality and people’s health.” In April, Lambeth council introduced several LTNs in the south London borough, including the one on Railton Road, north of Herne Hill station. Some residents claimed to be trapped by the planters that blocked vehicle access on the sidestreets that feed Railton Road. But Giles Gibson, a business consultant and cycle campaigner, says that “access to every single front door has remained as it was”. Retailer Liam Plowman agrees. He delivers in the LTNs close to the Herne Hill off-licence Wild + Lees he has run with his wife Claire since 2016. “Driving now takes slightly longer, but I can drive to every address I could before,” he says. And Sarah Berry, voluntary co-chair of the Lambeth branch of the pedestrian organisation Living Streets, was encouraged to finally buy a bike – she hadn’t previously cycled in London. “When the LTN came in, it was ‘right, I’m out of excuses’. I went out and bought a bike on the same day.” It’s been a revelation. “I still haven’t gotten on a bus or a train or the tube since March. If I had been confined to only the areas I could walk to over the past six months, I’d be feeling a lot more isolated right now.”"
"There is only one thing more terrifying for a nesting bird than a person walking nearby: when that two-legged beast is joined by a four-legged companion. A study of how ground-nesting birds are disturbed on beaches in Spain has revealed how they are almost always scared from their nests by passing off-lead dogs, but seem unperturbed by motorbikes, helicopters and low-flying planes. Walkers accompanied by dogs flushed Kentish plovers from the foreshore nests 80% of the time when walking on paths over the beach, compared with just 12.9% of the time when without a dog. When walkers with dogs did not stick to paths but roamed the dunes, they scared the plovers from their nests 93.8% of the time. The study by Dr Miguel Ángel Gómez-Serrano of the University of Valencia found none of the 714 nest disturbance events observed on four beaches in Castellón and Valencia involved dogs on leads. “Fewer and fewer beaches have the capacity to host coastal bird breeding populations, so we should be concerned about conserving them,” said Gómez-Serrano, who called for dogs to be banned from more beaches during nesting season. “Dogs produce a disproportionate impact compared to that of people walking on the beach, so their entry into these areas should be limited at least in the most critical [breeding] season for these species. At this time, birds are incubating their eggs or guarding their chicks, and cannot change beaches to avoid disturbance.” The Kentish plover is a small, declining shorebird that lays camouflaged eggs on beaches across southern Europe. In Britain, similar shorebirds such as ringed plovers, oystercatchers, and little, common and sandwich terns nest on beaches. The ringed plover is on the “red list” of Britain’s most endangered birds. Its population fall of 37% between 1984 and 2007 partly attributed to nest disturbance as beaches become busier. While cordons are erected on some British beaches in spring to encourage walkers to keep off small areas of sand and shingle where birds nests, the string rarely keeps out dogs. Nesting birds will abandon their nests if disturbed too often, or their eggs may become too cold or too hot to hatch. Plover eggs have been found to tolerate temperatures between 15C and 42C before the embryo dies, with eggs rapidly overheating in Spain if left in direct sunlight without the bird sitting on them. The study, which was published in Ibis, the international journal of avian science, found that on busier beaches the flushed birds returned more quickly to their nests, suggesting they could become habituated to humans nearby. But with dogs banned from busy urban beaches in Spain during the holiday season – as is also the case on many British beaches – Gómez-Serrano said there were now more dogs being taken to remote, wildlife-rich beaches for exercise. Mark Cocker, a naturalist and author, said: “We’re in denial. We know dogs are genetically wolves and we have 10 million of them in this country. There’s clearly an environmental issue, but conservationists are scared of talking about it because it’s such a strong lobby. It’s about dog-owners showing restraint and understanding they are part of a very large cohort of people and the privilege of owning a dog comes with responsibilities. “It’s not about excluding dogs from beaches or public spaces but acknowledging that dogs off leashes cause significant problems. Dogs could easily be kept on a lead between the months of March and June when birds nest. For eight months of the year, they wouldn’t be interfering with birds’ reproduction on the beach and there should be no conflict.” Asked whether keeping dogs on leads during the spring breeding season would help nesting birds, Gómez-Serrano said: “Although the roaming movements of dogs are more reduced when on lead, dogs trigger an anti-predatory instinct in birds not comparable to that of humans. “In addition, unfortunately dog owners do not usually comply with the regulations about dog walking on leads, so surveillance is necessary so that these regulations are respected. Obviously, there is usually not enough budget for this purpose, and managers prefer not to address this widespread problem in coastal areas.”"
"Environment agency officials were under pressure on Monday to explain exactly what consent they gave to carry out extensive work on the banks of a protected river in England. Officials from the EA, Natural England and the Forestry Commission moved in last week to stop the work along the River Lugg outside Kingsland, near Leominster in Herefordshire. The officials – along with the police – issued a stop notice to the landowner, John Price, to halt the works, which the local wildlife trust said had devastated the river and would have dire consequences for wildlife and water quality. The EA said a legal notice requiring the works to stop immediately was served on the landowner by Natural England earlier last week, the Forestry Commission issued a stop letter requiring an end to any further felling work and the Environment Agency requested no further works to be carried out on the river. But the landowner Price, a potato and cattle farmer, has insisted that he was asked to do the work by the EA to try to tackle flooding in the area. On Monday the local parish council told the Guardian it had been in discussion with the EA since July about tackling the flooding in the area. EA officials had attended parish council meetings and walked the site in September. The EA wrote a short report seen by the Guardian. It said: “We have identified that some tree works are required on the left hand bank directly upstream of the bridge (see picture 0141) which we will again look to secure funding for and if successful make the land owner aware of our intentions. “In addition the left hand bank directly upstream of the bridge could do some reprofiling due to bank slumping probably as a result of cattle poaching (see picture 0132) to ease conveyance as it is currently partially obstructing the 3rd arch of the bridge and will look to the land owner to carry out these works.” The EA said on Monday it was continuing to investigate the damage to a river which is protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), and a special area of conservation (SAC). As such no work should be carried out without permission from the EA. Minutes of parish council meetings confirm that the EA was in discussions with the council about flooding and what work was required to alleviate it. Minutes of Kingsland parish council meetings from July, September and October of this year contain items about the “maintenance of the Lugg”. In minutes of a meeting in July concerns were expressed about the risk of river flooding and reference made to discussions with the EA on maintenance of the Lugg. The minutes detail verbal discussions with the EA. “The levels reached during the floods earlier this year were the highest since 1976. Due to the Covid-19 situation, the riverbank has not been walked since the floods, however this is due to be done soon. “Dredging can be done where there is a need, but need to keep in mind the dynamic nature of the river which moves the bed levels anyway (diverse nature of river flow).” In October reference was made to the site visit in September with an EA official. “Cllr Rowsell reported on “a very useful” walkabout with the Environment Agency. Mr W Best, Environment Agency informed the meeting that riparian owners are responsible for maintenance but accepted that this may be beyond their capability at times and provided a helpline number.” A spokesperson for the parish council said on Monday they were not aware whether the EA had given the landowner official permission to carry out the works. He said: “We would not be told whether a permit had been issued for the works. The parish council supports work to improve the Lugg to help with flood alleviation measures. Environment Agency officials have been present in parish council meetings to discuss flood alleviation measures.” Price, of Hay Farm, told the Daily Telegraph, he had acted with permission. “I have watched this river all my life, and no one knows this river better than myself,” he said. “I have always looked after the river. I was asked to stop the erosion because I’m the landowner so I’m responsible for the river.” He said he had not uprooted any trees, but had only cleared those that had come down in floods. He said flooding in the area had been getting worse over the last 10 years, and that he had the support of the village and parish council in doing the work. The Environment Agency was asked for a comment. It had not been provided at the time of publication. "
"It’s fair to say I learned two main things in trying to test out a series of commuter-type e-bikes over the past few months. One was more of a rediscovery: they’re fantastic fun. The other was a surprise: at the moment, they’re really hard to get hold of. The coronavirus pandemic changed the UK in many ways, and one of the minor impacts was to spark an explosion of interest in e-bikes, as people sought out ways to return to work while avoiding public transport and traffic jams. After months of back-and-forth emails with bike companies and PRs, I got hold of the four featured below. I wanted to test more models, and some cheaper ones, but it couldn’t happen. Before I get into the details, there are three general points to make. Enough preamble; let’s get to the reviews. This innovative Dutch company is so convinced by the prospects for e-bike travel that it has stopped making conventional bikes altogether, though the distinctive frame design remains, with front and rear lights in the crossbar tube. In fact, pretty much everything is built into the frame, including the battery and motor, meaning fellow cyclists at red lights might not even realise what you’re riding until you shoot into the distance with a gentle whirring noise. At least by e-bike standards, the S3 is not hugely expensive, but the feel is very hi-tech and high-end. Rather than a clunky bolted-to-the-handlebar display, a digital readout in the crossbar gives you the speed and battery life. An associated app lets you vary the automatic gears. Even the bell is electronic, with an app-selected choice of noise. To ride, the S3 is genuinely fantastic. The motor power, which comes via the cranks rather than direct to a wheel, is smooth and gradual, without the sudden jolt that some older e-bikes used to give when you hit 15mph. In fact, the bike initially felt almost unnervingly nippy, until I realised the last test rider had left the app switched to US settings, meaning the electric power stayed on up to 20mph, the legal limit there. This is actually a bit worrying, as to use the bike in the UK like this would be illegal. I’m told VanMoof now don’t allow UK users to switch modes. If you have the budget for a VanMoof, a lot of it will come down to its quirks. For example, the fully integrated battery looks very slick. But it can’t be removed, so if, like me, you live in a flat and keep bikes in a garage without electric power, it makes the S3 slightly pointless. Similarly, some of the techy features felt a bit solution-in-search-of-a-problem. I endlessly fiddled with the ratios for the four-speed automatic gears, but could never find a range that even approximated how I’d want to change manually. Even the two electronic bell noises were a bit too abrasive for my tastes. But others will, and do, disagree. The VanMoof was definitely the bike that prompted the most interest and envy from neighbours and fellow riders, and if the design suits you, it is a delight to ride. In terms of commuting practicality, the S3 comes with full mudguards and a chair guard, and VanMoof makes its own front and rear racks, with branded pannier bags to go on them. I had hoped to try the same-priced commuter model in Halfords’ own-brand range, or a slightly cheaper folding version. But if e-bikes are in short supply, then (relatively) cheap ones are like gold dust, so I tried out the mountain bike. Though officially designed for hills and trails, it is still quite commuter-friendly, with eyelets for mudguards and a rear rack, while the wide tyres and suspension forks laugh in the face of bumpy surfaces. Not so long ago, cheaper e-bikes could be jerky and jolting, but the Vengeance is enormous fun, and handles with surprising nimbleness. At 23kg, it is undeniably something of a beast, but the electric motor hauls you up inclines with ease. I even tried riding it, motor-less, up one steep hill, and while I wouldn’t call it fun, it wasn’t impossible. On picking up the bike, I had worried whether its brakes – cable-operated disc models, as against the VanMoof’s hydraulic versions – might be a bit weedy against such bulk, but they were fine. The main journey I took was a 20-plus-mile cross-London round trip to see a friend, on a day of constantly pouring rain, and it was a great illustration of the benefits of an e-bike. Even dressed in trawlerman-style waterproofs, there was no chance of overly sweating, while the sheer bulk of the bike mitigated against skittish handling. Guided by a phone app along a complex route of back streets and low-traffic neighbourhoods, I found it almost relaxing. Yes, I could have done the trip on my normal bike, but the chances are I wouldn’t have bothered. The contrast between the VanMoof and the Brompton is perhaps best exemplified by their bells. While the former gave me the choice between two highly audible if grating electronic beeps, the Brompton’s small, highly polished bell produces the equivalent of a frock-coated butler politely clearing his throat. To continue the parallel, if the VanMoof has everything sleekly integrated, the e-Brompton is basically a standard model with a motor hub and battery pack added to the front. This is perhaps unfair. The electrification is both neat and elegant, with the front-wheel mounting allowing the bike to completely fold in the normal Brompton way. The battery comes in an elegant bag that clips to the front, and can be removed with a click and then carried. Wheel-drive e-bikes used to sometimes feel a bit clunky, but the Brompton is ultra-smooth, and hugely nippy in full-power mode (the only one I ever use for e-bikes, I have to confess), and is very manageable to ride on zero power, even with the minimalist two-gear system. As with all Bromptons, much depends on whether you need a folding bike. One extra advantage here is that e-bikes are very stealable, and with a Brompton you can safely keep it inside, at home or in an office. But then, of course, comes the price. Even the cheapest manual Brompton leaves minimal change from £800, but an extra £2,000 might feel a lot for that electric assist, however well engineered. However, Brompton fans tend to be loyal, so for those who can afford it, this could be a price worth paying. If the other bikes I tried all had their quirks, or niches, perhaps the best thing you can say about the Motus is that it is gloriously ordinary – a very sensible and well-fitted commuter bike that just happens to have an electric motor. With full mudguards, a chainguard and rack, sensible, swept-back handlebars, and even a kick stand, this is a bike for getting around town efficiently and without drama. On a conventional commuter bike, suspension forks tend to be a weighty irrelevance, but here they helped make the ride even smoother. None of this is to say the bike is dull. Particularly if you’ve never tried one, riding an e-bike is one of the most instantly grin-inducing things you can do on two wheels, and the Motus is zippy, smooth and enormous fun, even though it is no slimline machine, weighing in at about the same as the Carrera. Whereas some might feel baffled by the VanMoof’s app-adjusted inner workings, the Motus is a very obviously a conventional bike, with standard derailleur gears and no-fuss hydraulic discs. The electrics are controlled via a straightforward handlebar display. One thing I’ve not mentioned for any of the bikes is range, in part as this depends on so many factors, including what power setting you use, how much you pedal yourself, rider weight, and terrain. But e-bikes increasingly only need to be charged every few days, even once a week, as opposed to the range-anxiety-inducing creatures of before. The Raleigh claims a standard range of 76 miles, which is more than enough for a week of commuting for most people."
"Roger Payne has played the sounds made by humpback whales to thousands of people – “more than thousands,” he corrects himself – in the past 50 years. He has played sections in schools, in churches, on TV talk shows, at the UN; he’s played them to singers, musicians, politicians and other scientists. The response is always the same. For the first 30 seconds, there is mumbling, sometimes awkward giggling as the audience gets used to the deep, rumbling groans and high-pitched squeaks (this is when the TV shows usually cut it off).  But leave it longer – at least five minutes, ideally half an hour – and Payne finds a strange thing happens. “In that time, the audience would go totally silent,” says the 85-year-old, on a video call from rural Vermont. “You were unaware there was anybody in the room and then, when I killed it, there would be this… inhalation. You would hear people basically coming out of a kind of trance. That was the clue that, ‘This is changing the lives of these people.’ And that’s how I think we’ve got it to really make a difference.” In 1970, Payne led a team that released a five-track, 34-minute album called Songs of the Humpback Whale. To everyone’s surprise – Payne was a bioacoustics expert, not a musician – it became a hit: it sold more than 125,000 copies, making it the most popular nature recording of all time. Pete Seeger and Judy Collins, superstars at the time, wrote songs inspired by the record. When Nasa launched their Golden Record aboard the Voyager spacecraft in 1977, one of Payne’s songs was included on the 12-inch gold-plated disc, along with music from Bach, Mozart and Louis Armstrong. Then, in 1979, an extract from the album was sent to all National Geographic’s 10.5 million subscribers. This made it the largest single pressing in recording history – a record it holds to this day. On the 50th anniversary of Songs of the Humpback Whale, it can be hard to fathom how much has changed in our appreciation of the species. In the 1960s, tens of thousands of whales were slaughtered every year, mainly for soap, oil and pet food. Humpback whales, which numbered around 100,000 in 1900, had been hunted mercilessly and fewer than 7,000 remained. “They were headed towards extinction, no discussion,” says Payne. Payne’s own experience backed up this depressing picture. The first cetacean he ever saw was a dolphin that had washed ashore and died on the coast near Boston, when he was teaching at Tufts University. It was late at night and raining when he found the body. “Some bozo had chopped off its flukes and somebody else had stuffed a cigar butt in its blowhole,” he recalls. “I thought to myself, ‘Is this the only interaction that can occur between people and the wild world?’ I sat there, soaked to the bone, and decided it would be wonderful to do something about this. I had no chance of that at that moment, but a chance slowly appeared.” That “chance” was an encounter in 1967 with a man named Frank Watlington, an engineer for the US Navy, based in Bermuda . Since the 1950s, Watlington had been monitoring a large collection of hydrophones (microphones designed to record underwater sounds) 30 miles off the coast of the island, mainly with the hope of eavesdropping on Soviet submarines. “I never knew what his work was,” says Payne. “It was something secret: state-supported skulduggery in the ocean.” There’s no record of how effective Watlington’s official assignment was but the hydrophones proved to be the perfect tool for listening to humpback whales. We know now that, although many whales use sound to communicate, humpbacks are the only ones that “sing”: it might, on first hearing, sound like one drawn-out moan, but Payne, his first wife Katy and an associate, Scott McVay, proved that there is an intentional rhyme, repetition and structure in the noises. Female humpbacks do some quiet singing, but the loudest, most brazen crooning comes from males during the six-month breeding season. “My guess is that it is an advertising song, an invitation to females: ‘Hey, I’m a handsome dude ready to mate. Where are you baby?’” says Payne. “And the other function is that the sounds they are making would mean a threat: ‘Stay back buster or I’ll bust your ass!’” Either way, Payne realised from the moment that Watlington played him the tapes he had recorded that they had something special. He also knew, as he listened with tears in his eyes, that he potentially had the secret to stopping the massacre of these creatures. “It was dead obvious to me from sound number two or three that this was the most extraordinary thing ever heard in nature,” says Payne. “All I was interested in was trying to get the world to think: ‘Hey, folks, we’re killing off the largest animals that have ever lived in the history of the planet. This is nuts!’ Then here comes this fabulously beautiful thing. Suppose oak trees sang stunningly beautiful songs and you were concerned because oak forests were being levelled.” Songs of the Humpback Whale consisted of three of Watlington’s tracks, and two made by the Paynes. Payne sent out copies to the Beatles, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan: he heard that Dylan would sometimes stop his gigs and play a section of the recording. He met the Welsh singer Mary Hopkin, an early signing to the Beatles’ Apple label, best known for the No 1 single, Those Were The Days. After some initial confusion where she thought it was “the songs of Wales”, Hopkin listened rapt. “She said, ‘That’s the most beautiful sound I’ve ever heard. I wish I could sound that way.’ And of course she had a most beautiful voice.” Payne’s album did inspire a movement, much as he hoped. Support came with the foundation of Greenpeace in 1972, and in particular its Project Ahab in the mid-70s, in which activists parked their boats in front of the whalers’ harpoons. David Attenborough and Jacques Cousteau made popular documentaries focused on the creatures. In 1986, the International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling for all species, although Iceland, Norway and Japan still issue permits for scientific and commercial whaling. Whale song entered popular culture, becoming the main plot point of the 1986 film Star Trek: the Voyage Home and a gag in The Simpsons, where a college professor tries to woo Marge. And the numbers of whales has rebounded. Humpback whales have come back to pre-whaling populations, perhaps as many as 100,000. (Not all cetaceans have been so lucky: blue and North Atlantic right whales remain endangered.) “My whole thought was if we can build whales into human culture, then we can save them,” says Payne. “And I think that’s happened. Good God, I’m certainly not the one who did all the building. There are thousands, literally thousands of other people who did vast and wonderful things.” A half century on, Payne continues to write and lecture, and he has become involved in a pioneering group that is attempting to use machine learning to decipher what whales are actually saying – and maybe even, eventually, to communicate with them. It’s an outlandish concept but there are some high-powered individuals involved, including Britt Selvitelle, one of the founding team at Twitter, and Aza Raskin, who devised the now ubiquitous “infinite scroll” on webpages. Payne calls the endeavour a “wonderfully crazy thing”, but adds: “I think we have a hell of a good chance of it. Where you get stuff done is where you start mixing fields and discover these people are very close to knowing something I wish to hell I’d known 25 years ago.” Covid-19 has hampered any plans for a proper celebration of Songs of the Humpback Whale’s 50th birthday. But Payne believes that the record, not so fashionable these days, still resonates. “I listen to it frequently and it always hits me hard,” he says. “What is the main conclusion that whales build in your mind? My feeling is humility. Giant hurricanes build humility and so do tornadoes, but there’s nothing that does it better that I’ve ever encountered than a whale. And humility is something we need more experiences of. It’s just: God almighty, what a fabulous world exists around us and how utterly we’re destroying it.”"
"Mist is rising from the Water of Ae, turning gold as the dawn light slips across the valley through the forest of birch and pine. Fieldfares clatter down the path at our presence and a goldcrest calls sibilantly through the still air. Under the mist, a dipper stands up to its shins in the flow of clear water, bobbing with the ripples running over the rocks. I want to clamber down the bank and stick my finger in the river but by the bank I stop. A white branch catches my eye. I reach out a fingertip to feel that instead, and it crumbles to my touch like the powdery flakes of fresh snowfall. Hair ice. Uncommon but a speciality here. It is one of nature’s finest magic tricks: the freezing temperature revealing invisible processes. It needs damp air and a fungus, Exidiopsis effusa, to form. The fungus expels moisture along the radial rays of the wood and when this moisture meets the freezing air, it turns to ice. The wood keeps expelling water that freezes into thin wispy filaments, strands of ice that are almost invisible individually, that form a thick fur together. I hold one branch up to the sun: I see tiny water droplets suspended on the hair-like strings of ice. They burn white in the light, a cold blue in the shade. Best of all is how the name fits perfectly. The ice is coiffed. It has a parting. Either side of the branch its strands head off in different directions, neither crossing the parting but both curling around, ending up facing the same direction, almost as if it has been styled by the night’s air. Perhaps the greatest trick of all is in its disappearance. When we return down the path an hour later, the golden morning sunlight has crept across the river, warming our side of the bank. The ice has vanished, leaving only wood, damp from the thaw, clear of bark and moss. And I realise then something I’ve wanted to know all year. The clarity of ice is this: that nothing lasts for ever. The real trick is how to make the most of it."
"The Norwegian fishing village of Bugøynes, 310 miles north of the Arctic Circle and a frigid, dark place for much of the year, was on the edge of ruin. Work was scarce. Years of overfishing and mismanagement had stymied cod quotas. Boats lay idle in cold waters. Those who chose to stay were forced to rely on what meagre wages they could still muster from fishing and processing. That is, until the crabs arrived. Starting in the 1980s, woeful fishermen began hoisting up mysterious, spindly giants in their nets in Varangerfjord. The aliens, brandishing two menacing pincers, weighed far more than the brown crabs they had seen farther south. Unknown to the fishermen, the crustaceans had traveled from Russia, where scientists had introduced red king crabs on the Murman coast during the 1960s with the goal of establishing a new, lucrative fishery. Slowly, the crabs scuttled the 60 or so miles over the border into Norway. The deep fjords in the Barents Sea near Bugøynes provided the perfect cover. The invasion of “Stalin’s red army” was initially seen as a disaster. The crabs became entangled in gillnets and longlines, removing bait and causing damage that allowed coveted fish species to escape. But when the fishermen learned of the million-dollar Alaskan king crab fishery, they realised the crab could be more boom than bust. Today the red king crab is largely credited with rescuing the fishing villages of the north during a time when cod was sparse. The monstrous crabs, which now number in the millions, have become the centre of a huge industry: this October alone, Norway exported nearly $9m (£6.7m) worth of king crab. The price of king crab has tripled in just over a decade, according to the Norwegian Seafood Council. The fishermen of Bugøynes can sell their catch for more than 210 Norwegian kroner ($24) a kilo to producers, who distribute the crustaceans to the world’s finest restaurants, hotels and casinos. The Norwegian government recently announced it was increasing the male crab quota by 18% to 1,810 tonnes in 2021. But while the crabs have largely been good news for fishermen and the economy, the same can’t be said for other species. Following the crab’s cross-border move, native seafloor species have rapidly declined. The crabs are continuing to expand their territory, and could soon arrive in the Lofoten Islands, one of the world’s largest seasonal cod fisheries. That puts government regulators in a tough spot, between securing the long-term economic viability of the crab fishery and limiting its takeover of native species and traditional fisheries. They ultimately can’t push for total eradication if king crab is to continue buoying northern coastal communities – but at what cost? Inside the Norway King Crab facility on the docks of Bugøynes, 3,000 red king crabs float in 30 giant round tanks. This is just one day’s catch. Soon they’ll be transported 1,100 miles by truck to Oslo, where they will be loaded on to cargo planes and shipped live around the world – to Dubai, Los Angeles, Kuala Lumpur. The fishermen of Varangerfjord place pots year-round, with peak season running from October to January. How many crabs they can catch is regulated by a quota set by the government each year to ensure the future of the commercial fishery. Every few days, fishermen check herring- and mackerel-baited pots that can trap up to 50 large crabs at a time. Then they return to shore to sell their catch. “When the crabs came here, it put life in our small places,” says Gentjan Kryeziu, operations manager of Norway King Crab, one of the largest crab producers in Troms og Finnmark county. The company buys roughly 20% of the annual quota from fishermen for processing. Kryeziu, originally from Albania, is one of many foreign workers who have moved to Bugøynes to work in the king crab industry. “If you’re a skilful, not lazy fisherman, you can get your full quota – two or three tonnes per boat – in two or three weeks maximum. Then you are done and get cash in your pocket,” says Roman Vasilyev, a Russian scientist who moved to Bugøynes in 2013 to help advance the technology for shipping live crabs, which sell for more money than processed ones – as much as 1,000 Norwegian kroner ($120) in restaurants. The king crab earned its spot at the top of the marine monarchy for a reason: it crawls along the seafloor eating starfish, worms, sea cucumbers and molluscs. The crabs have few natural predators in cold Arctic waters. When researchers surveyed the fjords of the Varanger region around Bugøynes in 2012, they found that the abundance of many seafloor species had dramatically declined since the crab’s arrival. In some areas, mussels and starfish had disappeared completely. Such changes ripple up the food chain: other native species, such as haddock, depend on these seafloor species for food. “[The crabs] could even change the oxygen conditions on the seafloor since they nip out the animals that dig up and turn over the sediment,” says Haakon Hop, a marine biologist at the Norwegian Polar Institute. A reduction in oxygen, known as hypoxia, can further trigger species die-offs in the marine ecosystem. These environmental changes have perhaps prompted higher red king crab fishery quotas to help conserve the native bottom-dwellers. “Over the last few years, the department of fisheries has decided on quotas higher than the recommendations,” says Ton-Ola Rudi, a senior adviser who is responsible for management of king crab in the north. The government has often dithered over whether to manage the crabs as a valuable fishery stock – setting the total allowable catch to ensure long-term sustainable harvesting – or as a destructive invader, with populations restricted to save other fisheries and species. In fact, there is already an “eradication” fishery established west of North Cape, about 100 miles from Bugøynes: anyone with a boat here is allowed to harvest king crab. The aim is to prevent the crabs from disrupting another lucrative industry: cod, which gather in abundance at the nearby Lofoten Islands. But around Varangerfjord, where crab density is extremely high, total eradication probably isn’t feasible. Moreover, fishermen can often make more money in less time catching crabs compared with other species and have grown accustomed to the financial rewards. A budding tourist industry is developing too. Edgar Olsen, who has lived in the town of Nesseby between Varangerfjord and the Tana River all his life, considers himself a fisherman of cod and haddock, but now also fills his crab quota, and works as a tourist guide on king crab expeditions in the fjords, taking visitors out into the fjord to see and, later, taste the crab. King crab, he says, has had a positive effect for some, but he’d be happier without them, particularly given that cod stocks have recovered in Norway. “It’s quick money,” he says of king crab. But people will lose their whole fish catch if a crab damages the gillnet or long line, he adds. For now, however, hundreds of small vessels continue to rove the fjords looking for the crustaceans. In parts of northern Norway, gillnet fishing has more or less stopped due to the crustacean’s takeover. As for its detrimental impact on the ecosystem, the problem is likely to persist as long as king crab retains its popularity on the plate over Norway’s native fish species. “The best parties always have king crab,” says Hop, the marine biologist. “At the confirmation for our daughter, we served king crab. We did not serve cod.”"
"I don’t usually take binoculars on my early-morning bike ride; if I did, I would stop too often to get any benefit. But after a swift circuit around the levels, I picked them up and headed down the lane behind my home to look for a stonechat I’d seen the day before. The stonechat had moved on; possibly because of the presence of a male merlin – the first I’d seen here in Somerset for a decade. I first noticed the bird as he flew away from me, and resigned myself to the usual brief views. But moments later, he landed on top of a tall hedgerow. As I freewheeled slowly closer, I feared my luminous yellow cycling top would spook him. Yet to my delight, he stayed put, giving me my best ever view of this, our smallest falcon. Gunmetal grey-blue above, his streaked breast tinged with orange, he first turned to look at me, then away, showing off the false “eyes” on the back of his head. These are supposed to deter larger predators; but they may actually be to goad smaller birds, such as skylarks and meadow pipits, into mobbing him. Then he dropped off the perch and flew away, direct and low, off to ambush those same pipits and skylarks, somewhere across the moor. The Swallow: A Biography, by Stephen Moss, is published by Square Peg (£12.99). It is available through the Guardian Bookshop for £11.30. "
"One of the most remarkable creatures on the planet is the common octopus, or Octopus vulgaris, which is now well established in UK waters as our seas warm because of the climate crisis. It has three hearts, and eight limbs with 200 suckers that can feel, taste and smell its surroundings. Scientists remain divided over whether it has one brain or nine. In mammals, most neurons are in the brain, but with octopuses, two-thirds are in their body and arms, enabling each arm to do complex tasks, such as opening jars to obtain food, apparently independently from the central brain. After much experimenting with underwater mazes and other contraptions, scientists concluded that octopuses could solve various problems with one limb and then communicate the experience to other arms via the central brain. The creatures only live about two years, changing colour to merge into the background while wandering about the seabed eating shellfish and anything they catch. To escape being eaten themselves by sharks or fish such as cod they release ink and use a jet of water to escape to a hiding place. During winter storms, octopuses can be stranded on beaches and in rock pools. Rescuers report eye contact, possibly an attempt at communication, before they swim away. "
"I’m out here again, as much because I need to be as because I want to be. In spring, during the first lockdown, our garden became very important to me and my family. In long hours out here, and only here, we got to know it more intimately than before. Noticed more. Felt the changes more acutely in its trees, leaves, its other residents – hedgehogs, bees, red kites passing overhead – as spring thickened into summer. Now, at the opposite end of the year, those things are thinning. Before, I tried to stand in one place, to deepen my observance of a suddenly smaller world. Now it’s autumn and, again restricted, I try to do the same, differently. I close my eyes, engage my other senses, and let them wander around the landscape surrounding my home. From a sensory point of view, autumn is my favourite time of year. There are the sights, of course: the way the sun rims the edge of everything, all day. Colours richer, or the light on them, or both. Morning mists; evening glow. But tune these out and you find other things easily eclipsed by those vivid sights. Sounds build a collage of the season. The hard concussion of a neighbour chopping logs.  The rattle of leaves dry and curled in the canopy of the sycamore, and the creak of the horse chestnut’s naked branches, both enlivened by a wind that seems to come from a colder place than the air. This comes and goes, making the landscape breathe with an ebbing, collective hiss. I lie on the ground, palms to the grass, and feel with fingertips the damp soil – soil that won’t be dry now until spring. I smell the acrid dew-damp leaves on the ground, that subtle odour of slow decay. And on the wind, woodsmoke from other houses; for however long, still the signature of winter. I look, too. It’s necessary in the windy season, if only to check the trees for damage. I find a little: a branch blown from a silver birch lies prone on rusty leaves, the shape of a tuning fork. Like spring, autumn is one of those directional changes. Here, the seasons meet a junction and the year takes the colder, darker, sketchier road."
"After spending hundreds of hours observing pygmy seahorses for my doctorate, I knew exactly when Tom, a Denise’s pygmy seahorse in Sulawesi, Indonesia, would give birth. He swam with great resolve (1) from where he slept each night with his partner, Josephine, against the current, to the edge of the gorgonian seafan (a type of coral) that the two inhabited. He never faltered. At the edge of the coral, the current was at its strongest, offering the greatest chance of sweeping his offspring out to the relative safety of the open ocean. Having grabbed on to the edge of the gorgonian with his tail, Tom began to give birth. Over several occasions I witnessed him release between six and 12 fry. The labour was obviously arduous and he was crunched over, panting for breath. Two of the dark-coloured fry are seen here (2) forcefully being expelled from his brood pouch. With adults measuring less than 2cm in length, the fry are just 2-3mm long. Their dark colour gives them some degree of camouflage in the open ocean and they will spend two to three weeks floating freely in currents, before settling to a gorgonian of their own. It took Tom a little while of crunching, drawing in water and crunching again before the last baby finally popped out (3). The juvenile had been with its siblings for almost two weeks in the brood pouch. When they are born, aside from colour, they appear to be miniature versions of their parents. It’s not until they settle to a new gorgonian that they adapt in surface texture and colour to match their particular home. I recorded the transition of a juvenile pygmy seahorse and it took five days to become a perfect match with the gorgonian. After all the babies have finally been released, the male pygmy seahorse is perhaps the only male in the animal kingdom to truly suffer from stretch marks. His empty brood pouch was now wrinkled (4) following the birth of the fry he had been carrying. Although he was clearly quite exhausted, Tom immediately headed back to where Josephine was resting. There wasn’t a moment’s respite for him, as Josephine quickly emerged and began a series of ritualised quivers to convey her intention to proceed to the next part of the reproductive cycle. After a series of ritualised dances, Tom and Josephine both released their grip of the gorgonian coral and their tails intertwined (5). Tom was still very deflated after having given birth 20 minutes or so before. Josephine, on the left, is clearly rather plump because she is full of a clutch of unfertilised eggs. Females begin to hydrate their clutch a few days before mating. The daily courtship rituals are carried out to help synchronise the pair’s reproductive cycles. It is important the female doesn’t begin to prepare the eggs for mating too early as they may spoil if the male is not ready. It took 45 seconds for Josephine to push the unfertilised eggs across to Tom’s empty brood pouch (6). As they entered his reproductive system he fertilised them. The sequence allowed Tom to be certain that each and every baby he would carry would be his own. This certainty of paternity is extremely rare in the animal kingdom, and explains why male seahorses put so much effort into raising their offspring. It was an honour to be the first person to witness and record this series of events. Bargibant’s and Denise’s pygmy seahorses live exclusively on the surface of gorgonian seafans (7). These seahorses are very hard to find because of their miniature size and fantastic camouflage, so knowing which species of gorgonians they live on is a huge help. Gorgonians are fan-like corals that can get as large as a car’s windscreen. They attach to the reef where ocean currents hit, bringing large volumes of nutrients. They are covered in polyps that trap plankton for food. These are animals, not plants, so don’t need sunlight for energy. In 2013 I was in Okinawa in Japan to attend a conference. Years before, I had seen a picture of an unusual pygmy seahorse taken in Japan that piqued my interest. After hours trawling the internet, I tracked down a location where I thought I might find it and headed to the small island of Hachijō-jima, south of Tokyo. Amazingly, over the course of a few days I managed to find more than a dozen of them (8) and was sure they were distinct from all others I had seen before. It wasn’t until I was presenting at another conference a few years later that things started moving forwards. During my keynote presentation, I mentioned these pygmy seahorses and that I was sure they were a new species. Graham Short, an expert in seahorse taxonomy, came and spoke to me, which immediately began a flurry of seahorse excitement. Eighteen months later, we named the new 2cm-long pygmy seahorse Hippocampus japapigu (9). At the time, it was thought to only occur in the waters off Japan, but it has since been confirmed as far south as Taiwan. In May of this year, colleagues from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and I named a new species of pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus nalu (10). A few months earlier, a dive guide had spotted it in Sodwana Bay, in north-eastern South Africa. I went with a colleague to observe it first hand. It is the first pygmy seahorse to have been recorded anywhere in the Indian Ocean. The waters off South Africa are quite wild, and it wasn’t easy to find and photograph them as each surge wave dragged me several metres away from the subject. Several years ago a diver came across a strange fish and assumed it was New Zealand’s first indigenous seahorse. It was, in fact, a new species of pygmy pipehorse (11), a very close relative of the seahorse. I managed to capture one of the only images of this species in the wild in 2017. At that time, it hadn’t been seen in over six months. The pipehorse is only 5-6cm long with immaculate camouflage. I found a pair clinging to a tiny algal frond. An undescribed species of ghost pipefish, commonly known as the velvetghost pipefish (12), tends to live around brightly coloured sponges, and each individual pipefish matches exactly the colour of the sponge immediately adjacent to where it lives. There are half a dozen or so other ghost pipefishes found across the Indo-Pacific oceans, and each is highly adapted for its habitat. Some are white, others pink or even scarlet. They usually live in male-female pairs that hunt tiny shrimps and other crustaceans. Since the turn of the millennium there has been a flurry of discoveries of miniature fishes. I believe this is because the megafauna – such as sharks, turtles and rays – around south-east Asia have dwindled to such an extent that recreational divers and their guides began to look at smaller creatures to satisfy their curiosity. This thread pipehorse, Kyonemichthys rumengani (13), was described in 2007. It is just 2.6cm long and looks like several intertwined hairs moving around. Just like seahorses, these fish brood their young in a pouch on the male’s belly. Lynne’s pipefish, Festucalex rufus (14), was only named in 2015. Again, it evaded detection owing to its small size, habitat specificity and highly efficient camouflage. It is the size of a cocktail stick and lives only among little patches of a certain sponge found on coral reef walls below around 15 metres depth. It matches the sponge exactly in texture and colour, and even when you’re looking directly at one, it’s almost impossible to see it. Two risk factors for a species’ chance of extinction are their habitat specificity and geographic range. This pygmy seahorse (15) was named in 2009 as the Walea soft coral pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus waleananus. In the year before it was described, I observed it in the wild and am one of the few to have done so. It is only found in one small bay in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, where it lives only on the surface of certain soft corals. There has never been any research on their biology but the relative risks to their populations are great. Just one species of pygmy seahorse was known before the turn of the millennium. Since then, another seven have been added to the list. I took this image of Pontoh’s pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus pontohi (16), which was named in 2008, in February this year in Indonesia. The dark-coloured Pontoh’s were originally described as a distinct species, but genetic analysis has shown that they are the same as the white form. Seahorses are extremely variable in colour and surface texture, which has led to many new species being erroneously named over the years. The Japanese pygmy seahorse (17) appears superficially similar to several others, but genetic analysis shows it split from all others around 8 million years ago. It has a few morphological differences, too, which allow the trained eye to identify it. Unlike Bargibant’s and Denise’s pygmies, which live on the surface of gorgonian corals, I found the Japanese species grasping to the algal tufts that cover the huge volcanic boulders found around Hachijō-jima. Because of this, it is much harder to find them. The large swells off Hachijō mean it’s difficult to stay still enough in the water to keep an eye on them. Sadly, pristine coral reefs like this one in West Papua, Indonesia (18), are becoming much harder to find. One of the greatest threats comes from coral bleaching. When the water around coral reefs is 2C above the average for the time of year, the symbiotic algae within the coral’s cells become stressed and leave. The algae contain photosynthetic pigments that provide energy to the coral. In exchange, the coral provides the algae with its own waste products, which act as a fertiliser. Without the algae, coral is left ghostly white. Some researchers believe coral reefs in their current form may not survive beyond 2050. That, in turn, means the pygmy seahorse faces an uncertain future.

"The capacity of the EU’s offshore windfarms in the North Sea, the Baltic, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea will be increased 25-fold, under a draft plan drawn up by the European commission. The move follows Boris Johnson’s announcement this year of his intention to generate enough electricity to power every home in the UK within a decade from the country’s offshore sites. Both the UK and the EU are seeking to make progress on the target of carbon emission neutrality by 2050 and pioneer potentially rival innovations that will put its industry at the forefront of the growing sector. The total energy generating capacity in Europe’s seas stands at 23 gigawatts (GW), with 12GW of the total from 5,047 grid-connected wind turbines across 12 countries, including the UK. Under a European commission strategy, the 27 EU member states alone would achieve a capacity of 60GW by 2030 and 300GW by 2050, with Germany set to hugely increase its investment in the sector. According to the leaked paper, the commission “estimates that an installed capacity of 300GW of offshore wind [and around 60GW of ocean energies] by 2050 would be needed in the integrated, greener and climate neutral energy system of 2050.” The commission writes: “This is feasible for a sector where Europe has gained unrivalled technological, scientific and industrial experience and where strong capacity exists already across the supply chain, from manufacturing to shipping and installation. Nonetheless, it is a very challenging horizon. It means that offshore renewable energy capacity should be multiplied by 25 times by 2050. The investment needed is estimated up to €789bn.” The UK, which left the EU in January, has the largest amount of offshore wind capacity in Europe, with 45% of all installations. Germany is second with 34%, followed by Denmark (8%), Belgium (7%) and the Netherlands (5%). The UK, home to the world’s largest windfarms in Walney and Hornsea 1 in the North Sea, is currently investing more in offshore wind than any other country. Walney windfarm generates power for more than 600,000 homes across Cumbria, while Hornsea 1 supports power for over 1m households across the UK. Over the summer, the German government said it would also increase its current 7.5GW of capacity to 20GW by 2030, with a target of 40GW by 2040. But the European commission has called for a more “resolute” approach across the bloc. According to a leak of the strategy obtained by the Euractiv news website, the “very challenging” target for new windfarms would come with an expected price tag of €789bn, creating 62,000 jobs in the offshore wind industry. To fully exploit the technology, the commission wants the EU member states to work across nationals to scale up capacity through so-called hybrid sites of which there is only one example in Europe as it stands. The Kriegers Flak site, an offshore windfarm located between Germany and Denmark, is also forced to operate under a transitional arrangement due to lack of enabling EU legislation. The commission strategy, set to be unveiled on Thursday, will call for investment in both classic fixed-bottom turbines and newer floating infrastructure which can be installed in deeper waters. There is concern that the European countries are failing to invest significantly enough in offshore sites. The strategy paper notes that “nearly half of global offshore wind investment in 2018 took place in China”. Iván Pineda, director of public affairs at WindEurope, the body representing the off-shore sector, said: “Offshore wind is cheap but requires huge upfront investment. So it’s crucial to minimise the finance costs. And the best way to do that is to ensure windfarms have stable income. It’s very important the strategy recognises this, both for conventional windfarms and the hybrid ones that connect to more than one country. “We need to rethink how offshore wind is deployed in Europe. Connecting windfarms to more than one country is a logical evolution and crucial step to optimise space at sea, reduce costs of grids, and send electricity where it is needed. The current EU rules put offshore hybrids at a disadvantage against regular offshore wind and interconnector projects.”"
"The world’s largest power station is planned for a vast piece of desert about half the size of greater suburban Sydney in Australia’s remote north-west. Called the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, its size is difficult to conceptualise. If built in full, there will be 1,600 giant wind turbines and a 78 sq km array of solar panels a couple of hundred kilometres east of Port Hedland in the Pilbara. This solar-wind hybrid power plant would have a capacity of 26 gigawatts, more than Australia’s entire coal power fleet. The hub’s backers say the daytime sun and nightly winds blowing in from the Indian Ocean are perfectly calibrated to provide a near constant source of emissions-free energy around the clock. Most of it will be used to run 14GW of electrolysers that will convert desalinated seawater into “green hydrogen” – a form of energy that analysts expect to be in increasing demand as a replacement for fossil fuels in the years and decades ahead. Though still five years away from construction, the hub vaulted closer to reality in recent weeks after the federal government granted it major project status – a designation that should smooth the approval processes – and the Western Australian government greenlit its first stage. It is an ambitious undertaking, but it is not alone. The Asian Renewable Energy Hub heads a list of projects and potential developments, many private and some government backed, that are seeking to capitalise on what the economist Ross Garnaut described as Australia’s potential to be a clean energy superpower. While Australia’s climate politics remain stuck in gridlock, the government is focused on promoting gas-fired developments and – Covid-19 aside – national greenhouse gas emissions have largely flatlined in the years since the Coalition abolished an overarching federal climate policy. However, the plummeting cost of solar and wind energy is encouraging investments that seemed unlikely not long ago. The pace of investment in large-scale clean energy has slowed since the 23% national renewable energy target was filled and not replaced last year, but state governments and corporates are filling some of that gap. This week alone there were a string of extraordinary announcements. The New South Wales government plans to underwrite 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of storage over the next decade, Woolworths is promising to run its supermarkets and operations on 100% green energy within five years, and the country’s biggest super fund, AustralianSuper, dumped its shares in Whitehaven Coal as it set a path to a net-zero emissions investment portfolio by 2050. Perhaps most remarkably, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest foreshadowed that his Fortescue Metals Group would move aggressively into renewable energy, setting a goal of building 235GW across the globe. Here are some of the other green shoots and big ideas that are on the horizon or, in some cases, already with us. The Pilbara project was initially planned as a means to sell green energy to coal-rich Indonesia via sub-sea cable. That idea has been dropped in favour of hydrogen, based on the expectation that by 2035 the world will be looking for vast amounts of green fuel to replace coal, gas and oil. Alex Hewitt, the founder and director of CWP Renewables, an Australian-based partner in the hub, says the $53bn development is the country’s first “renewable energy project at oil and gas scale” – and a sign of where the world is headed. “The buzzwords here are scale and urgency,” he says. “When fully operational this will produce 1.8m tonnes of hydrogen every year for decades, with an energy content equivalent to 40% of Australia’s overall electricity generation.” All being well, Hewitt says, its first shipment of green energy into Asia will be made in 2027. Hydrogen has grabbed the attention of politicians and industry, including winning support at federal and state level in Australia. There are more than 20 smaller hydrogen projects under way across the country, but the hub dwarfs them. Hewitt says it will allow the fuel to be produced for less than $2 a kilogram, the level at which the Morrison government expects it to be cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. “It’s amazing how fast the transition is coming,” he says. “All the technology we’re using is proven at demonstration level. We have the right backing, we have the partners and it will get done.” The consortium expects 3GW of its solar and wind capacity to be used locally to power mining sites and large trucks, replacing 3bn litres of imported diesel used in the Pilbara each year. Some of the energy may help create new industries such as green steel, which is seen as a significant economic opportunity once coal-fired processes can be affordably replaced with renewables and hydrogen. But most of the energy created will be exported. Because hydrogen condenses from a gas into a liquid only at very low temperatures (about -250C), it will be shipped as green ammonia, which is safer to transport and created by blending hydrogen with nitrogen. While not everyone is as bullish, the consortium believes the applications for green hydrogen and ammonia may be as broad as fossil fuels are today, including heavy road transport, long-range shipping and aviation, fertiliser production, energy-intensive big industry such as mining operations, and electricity generation. On the latter, they are closely watching a Japanese trial using ammonia to co-fire an existing coal power plant. The second of Australia’s two giant renewable export projects is no less extraordinary in its ambition, and also has been granted major project status from the federal government. Like the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, it is billed as the largest of its type in the world. The $22bn Sun Cable proposal, backed by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Forrest, involves building a 10GW solar farm with battery storage at the Newcastle Waters cattle station about 750km south of Darwin. Some of the electricity may be used to help power the Northern Territory capital and Indigenous settlements, but most would be intended for transmission via sub-sea cables that would snake 3,800kms through the Indonesian archipelago to Singapore. Sun Cable’s chief executive, David Griffin, has said the project could provide up to a fifth of the city-state’s electricity. Long-distance high-voltage direct current submarine cables are used in Europe, but this would be the world’s longest by some distance. The NT government last month announced the project had reached the first stage of the environmental approvals process, and Sun Cable has begun discussions with authorities in both Singapore and Indonesia and surveyed the first 750km of the route. Its goal is to start construction in late 2023 and, like the Pilbara hub, to be exporting by 2027. While onshore wind and solar have boomed in recent years as developers rushed to fill the national renewable energy target, Australia is yet to follow other countries – particularly in northern Europe and Britain – in building turbines off the coast. That may change with a proposal to construct a 2.2GW windfarm in Bass Strait off Port Albert and Mcloughlins Beach in South Gippsland. According to the proponents, the $10bn project would be one of the world’s largest offshore windfarms, and likely to meet about 20% of Victoria’s electricity needs. It would involve a yet-to-be-determined number of turbines – the company just says hundreds – of between 185 and 245 metres being built on the seabed between 7km and 25km offshore. It is potentially a sensitive place to build, with plans needing to factor in the impact on marine life and of grid connections to the Latrobe Valley inland. One of the questions hanging over the project will be its cost, but Star of the South maintains it makes economic sense – that the technology is becoming cheaper and the generation patterns of offshore wind will complement, rather than compete with, onshore renewables. It is seeking environmental approval from the Victorian government and waiting on the commonwealth to complete a legal framework for offshore clean energy developments, but has a goal of starting to generate by 2025. Where offshore wind is in its infancy, batteries are being built at a pace few expected. Just four years ago, the Australian Energy Market Operator forecast that the country might have only 4MW of large-scale batteries by 2020, and build no more before 2036. The reality is a marked contrast. There is already 287MW in operation or committed to construction, including several batteries built alongside wind or solar developments. Last week, the Victorian government announced a contract for a 300MW battery near Geelong – larger than everything built to date and billed as one of the biggest in the world. While batteries are often assumed to be storing surplus energy from the middle of the day for use when the sun goes down, the primary use so far in Australia is to bolster the security of the grid. When something goes wrong — such as a major transmission line being taken out by a tornado or a power station “tripping”, as happens more than 100 times a year — batteries are called on to plug the gap in a fraction of a second to prevent the grid collapsing. Simon Holmes à Court, a senior adviser to the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University, said they were an attractive option for state governments wanting to strengthen their grids at modest cost. Independent reviews found Australia’s first big battery, built at Hornsdale in South Australia in 2017, saved consumers $150m in its first two years in operation. Expect to see more of them, rapidly. “Falling costs and greater familiarity of the technology have led to solar and wind developers increasingly building batteries into their plans,” Holmes à Court says. Perhaps the Asian Renewable Energy Hub will one day pass it, but for now the biggest power plant in the country is spread across 29% of Australian homes. By the middle of this year, the country had about 12GW of solar rooftop panels, with installations continuing at a pace unaffected by Covid-19 or the gradual winding back of government incentives. Investment in large-scale renewable energy fell this year, but the growth in small-scale solar has increased to fill the gap. It is expected 2.9GW will go up this year, equivalent in capacity to a couple of average-sized coal plants. It has prompted authorities to take steps so panels can be temporarily disconnected from the grid if the influx of solar power causes problems for grid security. The 20th-century electricity system, based on a handful of large generators, was not built to cope with an influx of distributed power. A better solution may be to make it more financially attractive to install household batteries, which if pooled together can operate as a centrally controlled virtual power plant, charging or dispatching energy to the grid as needed. South Australia is trialling this sort of system, but for now incentives are limited in most states. In the meantime, analysts expect the skyrocketing installation rate to continue, reflecting the International Energy Agency’s observation that solar can now offer the cheapest electricity in history."
"Ministers’ pledges to preserve the UK’s food and farming standards after Brexit will not prevent the import of lower-standard products and could spell potential disaster for Britain’s farmers, a report has found. The government has repeatedly promised that a ban on chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef would remain in place after Brexit, and has made changes to the way future trade bills will be scrutinised. But ministers have refused to sign safeguards on imported food into law, despite pressure from consumers and civil society groups. The headline bans on two products will still allow a large number of other lower-standard imports, while the changes to the way trade bills are managed are too weak to ensure a robust scrutiny of their impacts, according to the damning verdict of the Future British Standards Coalition (FBSC), which represents farmers and food producers, and animal welfare and green campaigners. Facing a potential second rebellion by its own MPs on the agriculture bill, the government agreed to strengthen the scrutiny of future trade bills with an expanded trade and agriculture commission (TAC), a statutory body with powers to advise on bills for the next three years. This was hailed by the National Farmers’ Union as heading off potential problems with trade bills lowering import standards. However, the FBSC found in a report on Friday that ministers would still have many powers to change the rules on food imports without parliamentary votes or robust scrutiny. Some standards on the use of antibiotics in farming, for instance, have already been scrapped, and rules governing the use of hormones on animals, and additives to food, will also be easier to alter. The FBSC also found that the TAC under current plans would not include representatives with expertise on public health, environment, animal welfare and consumer protection. Kath Dalmeny of the FBSC said she was “very positive” about the setting up of the TAC, but that it needed more powers and more expertise. She said “absolutely loads” of food products could be affected by a loosening of standards, done behind closed doors as part of trade deals. “There should be proper scrutiny, on issues such as antibiotic resistance, public health, [the impacts of products on] climate change and biodiversity loss,” she said. Antibiotic resistance was a particular problem, she said. The UK has high standards to prevent the overuse of antibiotics, and antibiotic use in farming has fallen in recent years. But many other countries still use antibiotics prophylactically and as growth promoters, which encourage the growth of resistant superbugs. The lack of rules on imports means that without strict measures to prevent it, meat and other products containing superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics could be imported under future trade agreements, threatening to spread such pathogens to the UK. “I think the government does not want its hands tied in any way when it goes into trade talks, so they have provided us with reassurances and advisory groups and given the impression that something robust is happening, but none of this holds anyone to account,” Dalmeny said. Some of the impacts of lower-standard imports are also being felt on the climate. Deforestation in some areas means agricultural production is harming the climate: beef from Brazil, for instance, has a carbon footprint about five times greater than the equivalent produced in the UK. Dalmeny called for ministers to strengthen safeguards by at least agreeing to widen the remit of the TAC, and ensure it is staffed with experts on the environment, public health and animal welfare as well as trade. “Consumers have consistently rejected the prospect of poorly produced food that hurts people, the planet and animals,” she said. “The government needs to show the public it is listening and taking advice from a wide range of experts.” George Dunn, the chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said: “The unity of voice across farming, environmental, animal welfare and public health groups underlines the imperative that the UK government does not drop the ball in reaching trade agreements which undermine domestic food production standards. “Extending the tenure of the TAC will mean nothing if it is toothless, sidelined and ignored. Now is the time for the government to show that it is indeed determined to deliver its general election manifesto commitment to protect standards in trade.”"
"It took just a few decades for Brazilian agriculture to transform its tropical savannah hinterlands – the Cerrado – into an agricultural powerhouse. Farmers and the growing agribusiness sector celebrated rising sales of soya and beef, and the roads and towns that grew up with them. But environmentalists and Cerrado communities say the advances came at the price of roaring deforestation, land grabbing, violence and the loss of traditional lands. Nearly half (44%) of the Cerrado’s native vegetation, which includes scrubland, grasslands and forests, is already used for agriculture, the MapBiomas monitoring project calculates. And under Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is supported by powerful farming lobbies, the rest of its 2m sq km is disappearing fast. Last year alone, 6,500 sq km was cleared – adding to the 283,000 sq km of forest, grassland and scrub cut down since 2001. This year so far the Cerrado has seen more than 61,000 fire alerts – up from 39,000 in the whole of 2018, before Bolsonaro took power – raising fears for its future. It is an immense, important carbon sink, storing hundreds of tons a hectare in its soil and deep root systems. “The Cerrado is like the water tank of Brazil. This is impacting the fluvial regime of rivers, of important rivers,” said Britaldo Soares-Filho, professor of environmental modelling at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. “The Cerrado is a biodiversity hotspot and is under a lot of pressure.” A diagonal swathe across the middle of Brazil, the Cerrado covers around 22% of the country. Its rich wildlife includes 11,620 plant species and more than 200 species of mammals, including jaguars, anteaters, rhea birds and tapirs. Ignored for years, the region took on more importance after the country’s capital was moved to Brasília in the middle of the Cerrado in 1960 and states in the centre-west began filling with farms. Brazil’s military dictatorship from 1964–1985 launched programmes to modernise Cerrado agriculture, improve its infrastructure and colonise its remoter areas. In the late 1970s, a Japanese-Brazilian programme was launched to help colonise and develop the region to guarantee soya supplies. Big multinational traders such as Cargill and Bunge moved in. Chinese investment helped pave roads and improve ports. “They created a structure that favoured export,” said Roberto Miranda, a professor of sociology at the Federal University of Campina Grande. The Amazon – which is even larger than the Cerrado – was also being increasingly exploited. But that destruction was attracting international attention and concern: meanwhile the Cerrado stayed below the radar. In a 2017 paper, Soares-Filho and other researchers calculated that while 49% of the Amazon was in protected areas such as conservation units and indigenous reserves, just 7.7% of the Cerrado was. Under Brazil’s 2012 Forest Code, farmers are required to leave 80% of Amazon land as a “legal reserve”, but just 20% in most of the Cerrado region. “The Cerrado was the poor relation,” said Soares-Filho. As a result, agribusiness loved it. The region’s “agricultural frontier” is a huge area Matopiba, home to former president Dilma Rousseff’s Matopiba development agency. “In the agriculture area, we are still capable of picking low-hanging fruit – and at the same time, expanding the tree,” Rousseff said at the launch in 2015. “That’s why it’s a very special moment.”  Farmers who moved into the region were realistic. “Our ambition was never to get rich, but we wanted to have something in life,” said Paulo Dalto Neto, who came to farm here in 1997. Land was cheap in this dry, inhospitable region, but he has been able to improve his soil, develop the local roads and plant hardy soya strains with high yields. The losers were the Cerrado’s traditional communities, who usually did not have legal titles to land they had used for generations. Soya farmers prized this land and in some cases unscrupulous land dealers were able to buy or simply steal it by falsifying documents. “The soya here brought us very few jobs … and brought us many disadvantages,” said Juarez de Souza, 63, from the tiny Melancias community in Piauí.  De Souza’s community is now engaged in a legal battle to prove ownership of their land, while the river local people used for water and fishing has, according to De Souza, been polluted by pesticides. He says he has received threats from land grabbers looking for land to sell on to bigger farmers. “For them the soya is gold,” he said. “There is a lot of money.” Moreover, the change in land use is now altering the climate of the region. There is less rain and the temperatures are higher, he says: studies show deforestation contributes to droughts and erratic river behaviour. And meanwhile the farmers chop away, bit by bit, at its natural vegetation. The problem is that, while Brazil struggles with an economic downturn as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far resulted in 169,000 deaths, the Cerrado’s production of soya, sold mostly for animal feed, is booming – and expected to reach a record 135m tons for the 2020–2021 harvest. “This is the strength of our agribusiness,” Tereza Cristina Dias, Brazil’s agriculture minister, tweeted on 10 November. Brazil expects record beef exports in November – with the lion’s share of the country’s cattle raised in Cerrado states. With Brazil running a heavy deficit, worsened by its emergency pandemic payments to tens of millions of people and a record 14% unemployment, its booming exports of agricultural commodities such as soya and beef come as a relief, said Fábio Klein, a public accounts analyst at Tendências, a São Paulo consulting outfit. “Agriculture is a very competitive sector, and the income it generates, although concentrated, spills over the rest of the economy, which is good for the country and the government.” Brazilian soya’s high protein and oil count makes it especially popular in China, Brazil’s biggest soya customer, says Kory Melby, an American agribusiness consultant based in the Cerrado town of Goiânia. “International and domestic markets are telling Brazil that even though Brazil is expanding as fast as she can, we would like her to expand even faster,” he says. “That blows my mind.” The problem is that while the Cerrado may seem like low-hanging fruit, in the long term Brazil is losing yet more of its precious forests and wildlife. Their loss will come with a heavy cost. Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"The Covid-19 mink variant that led to a cull of all mink in Denmark and the resignation of the country’s agriculture minister on Wednesday, is “very likely extinct”, said Denmark’s health ministry. The cull was sparked by research from one of Denmark’s public health bodies, the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), which showed that a mink variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus called C5 was harder for antibodies to neutralise and posed a potential threat to vaccine efficacy.  A press release from the Danish Health Ministry on Thursday said the SSI had not found the C5 variant since September. It said: “the sequencing of the positive tests are showing we have not been able to find the mink variation with Cluster 5 since 15 September and because of this the SSI is estimating that this variant has very likely has died out.” Despite political backlash the cull has continued, and farmers have until midnight Thursday to cull all mink in the country. Scientists broadly welcomed the C5 extinction announcement. “This is good news, although I suspected Cluster 5 was extinct already,” said University College London (UCL) Genetics Institute director Francois Balloux. “Its prevalence was never that high and has not been observed since last September.” Balloux said, in his view, the “concerns over Cluster 5 may have been overestimated at the time”, but said this did not mean that the cull had been unnecessary. “No, the cull was not unjustified. Mainly because of the number of mink infected with Covid-19. The mutation was not really the justification for me. It was the large mink reservoir of Covid-19. I would also mention that minks escape regularly, so you don’t want that risk of infecting the wild animal population either.” He added that although C5 was just one of several mink mutations in circulation, it had been the most worrying because of its structure. “It had four mutations in the spike protein but only one in the receptor binding domain (RBD), the Y453F mutation. It is the RBD area that is the most important in terms of the risk of reducing vaccine efficacy.” Balloux’s UCL colleague, microbiologist Prof Joanne Santini, said this indicated the Danish had successfully contained its transmission, but sounded a note of caution. “I would be interested to know whether the claim of extinction was due to quarantining people infected, isolating their contacts as well culling the infected mink, or if C5 died out naturally.” It would be critical, as well, Santini said, to exclude the possibility of other animals being infected. “Time will tell,” she said. Nor does the C5 extinction rule out the risk of similar mutations, and much is still unknown, she said. Danish thinktank estimates put the cost of mink farm closures at about 3bn Danish kroner (£360m), and last week Denmark’s breeder association and the world’s largest fur auction house, Kopenhagen Fur, announced a “controlled shutdown” over the next three years. Sweden’s health agency said on Thursday that a number of Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in people who work in the mink industry. Authorities are analysing viruses from the infected people and infected minks to see if there is a link between the cases and their contact with minks, the agency said in a statement.

"Labour risks losing support among young people unless it does more to champion a radical green new deal (GND) to tackle the climate crisis and rebuild the post-Covid economy with well-paid, unionised jobs, according to climate activists and young Labour supporters. School climate strikers and key youth groups within the party say they have been dismayed by what they see as the party’s failure to fight for the full “green industrial revolution” programme set out at the last election. And they warn that the party risks losing support among young people who have backed Labour in the past few years. Joe Brindle, 18, an organiser of school climate strikes in the UK, said many young people who were deeply concerned about climate breakdown were becoming disillusioned with Labour. “It is just really disappointing … The leadership will say that the GND is central to what they are doing but they hardly ever bring it up. “Before the election it felt like their number one priority, it was absolutely central to everything the party talking about, but now it is hardly ever mentioned and it is becoming hard to persuade people concerned about climate change that the Labour party is their best option.” Labour insisted that it remained committed to a radical environment programme to decarbonise the economy and tackle the climate crisis, adding it should be judged on its policies at the next election. Ed Miliband, the shadow energy minister, said: “Climate and the green agenda are absolutely central to Labour’s plan for our economy, society and country. We want to be judged at the next election by our ambition in tackling the climate crisis.” But the campaign group Labour for a Green New Deal said the party’s recent green economic recovery plan appeared to water down or abandon key planks of the previous manifesto – such as public ownership of energy companies, levels of investment, the number of homes that would receive retrofitting and solar panels, and the number of well-paid unionised jobs a GND could create. Lauren Townsend, spokesperson for the group, which was instrumental in getting the party to back the 2019 GND policy, said: “Labour might claim it’s building on the 2019 manifesto, but in reality the party’s climate policies are going backwards. Labour’s green recovery plan abandons a 2030 decarbonisation target, scraps key public ownership commitments and fails to take on the corporate actors driving the climate crisis.” She said this was not just a failure to address the scale of the climate crisis but would also be hugely damaging to Labour’s electoral chances. “By scaling back its climate ambitions, Labour risks losing an election-winning coalition, ranging from Brighton to Bolsover. The green new deal agenda offers jobs, investment and security to working-class communities across the country, and last year made Labour the party of climate. Watering down our ambitions isn’t just bad for the planet – it’s bad politics.” However, a spokesperson for Labour said it remained committed to a radical green new deal including the target to achieve the substantial majority of emissions reductions by 2030 and the nationalisation of the energy sector as set out at the last election. They said its recent green recovery plan was just a short term response to the Covid crisis, adding the party should be judged on the full green new deal it puts forward at the next election. Miliband insisted the party was fully committed to a transformative agenda. “That’s why our green economic plan challenged the government to bring forward £30bn capital investment in the next 18 months to support hundreds of thousands of new jobs in low-carbon sectors, in line with ambitious independent proposals.” He said this was “just the start” of the party’s plans for a GND which “must both decarbonise our economy and transform our country.” “We want to see much greater ambition in the scale and pace of the UK’s approach to the climate emergency, including eliminating the substantial majority of our emissions by 2030, exactly the same call we made in the 2019 manifesto.” But Jess Barnard, chair of Young Labour, which represents members aged 14-26 said the party had failed to lead on the issue that mattered most to young people since last year’s general election. “We really have not seen very much from Keir [Starmer] in his time as leader around the climate crisis.” She said there was growing concern among many younger voters who backed the party at the last election. “At the moment we really risk disenfranchising younger voters because they felt they had this ally in Labour and now we are suddenly absent from the debate, absent from opposition, we are absent from demanding action.” Gaya Sriskanthan, co-chair of Momentum, the grassroots campaign group which backed Jeremy Corbyn for leader, said it appeared Labour was no longer listening to young people or the trade unions on the issue of a green new deal. “The most fundamental question here is who is Labour listening to on this, who is informing its policy because it is not the membership, it is not the unions it is not the youth strikers.” She said an increased focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the role of hydrogen in Labour’s recent green recovery plan would be welcomed by big oil. “The fact that they are emphasising CCS and hydrogen is very curious – because these are exactly the sort of things the fossil fuel industry push because they want to focus on things that don’t challenge their fundamental power.” Labour denied the claim and said it was committed to working with members, unions and climate activists to tackle the crisis. Some MPs are also calling on the Labour leadership to do more to push a radical climate justice agenda.  Zarah Sultana, Labour MP for Coventry South, said: “This should be a 1945 moment, with Labour promising a radical green new deal to rebuild the economy with climate and social justice at its heart. Anything less risks not only losing support from young people, but also of abandoning the hope to avert the climate catastrophe.”"
"A sea otter off the coast of California caused a splash when it was photographed apparently trying to eat a shark – though it appears it did not manage to complete its meal. Photographers Don Henderson and Alice Cahill captured the unusual event, which involved a small horn shark, in Morro Bay last week. The images were shared by Sea Otter Savvy, a non-profit which seeks to promote “responsible wildlife viewing, awareness of the effect our behaviour can have on sea otters and other wildlife, and a safer, healthier coastal environment for all of us, otter and human alike”. Michael Harris, of the California department of fish and wildlife, told the website For the Win Outdoors: “To my knowledge … this is the first documented horn shark capture by a sea otter. There are reports of sea otters capturing skates and rays, but this is the first report of a shark. Sea otters will feed on fish, but it’s a very rare observation in California.” Sea otters, the smallest North American marine mammal, typically eat invertebrates such as sea urchins, clams and crabs. But as Sea Otter Savvy posted on Twitter: “If you watch sea otters long enough you will see a range of sea life brought to the surface. While fish are not unusual prey for more northern sea otters (Alaska & Russia), they are quite uncommon in California.” Horn sharks live on the seabed, eating a similar diet to otters with an extremely powerful bite. Whether or not the shark seized by the otter managed to bite back, Sea Otter Savvy noted: “Not surprisingly, while some nibbling may have occurred, the prey was not consumed.” Harris told For the Win Outdoors he was “fairly certain” the otter was an adult female."
"Endangered marine mammals and sea turtles are routinely being entangled in or are swallowing pieces of plastic that now riddle the oceans off US coastlines, a new report has found. The plastic-induced toll stretches from Florida, where a manatee was found dead with a stomach filled with plastic bags and straws, to Virginia where a sei whale died after swallowing a DVD case causing stomach lacerations, to California, where a juvenile elephant seal was discovered with a packing strap wrapped around its neck. In South Carolina, a loggerhead sea turtle defecated out almost 60 pieces of plastic while being rehabilitated. In total there is evidence of more than 1,800 marine animals from 40 species suffering from contact with plastics over the past decade, according to the first formal tally drawn from government and NGO data. Some examples of this phenomenon become well known – such as the whale that washed up with 40kg of plastic in its stomach last year – but the true toll is certainly far higher, with most entanglements unseen by humans. “We may never know the true number but the details we do have are heartbreaking,” said Kimberly Warner, a senior scientist at Oceana, the conservation organization that collated the report. “The plastic is everywhere, even within deep-diving animals that you rarely see, and it is getting worse.” Animals can inadvertently swallow floating pieces of plastic while feeding or may even mistake the pieces for food. The Oceana report found that plastic bags, balloons, recreational fishing line, plastic sheeting and food wrappers were the most commonly ingested items, causing internal injuries or hampering the ability of the animals to feed. Other pieces of plastic can become wrapped around necks, fins or flippers, causing deep injuries or hampering movement. In Hawaii, a monk seal was found with a plastic water bottle stuck on its snout while in California a food wrapper was discovered lodged in the esophagus of a dolphin. This blight could prove a material threat to the viability of some species, with the Oceana report finding that 88% of creatures recorded with plastic on or in them are from species listed as threatened or endangered by the US. Around 11m tonnes of plastic flow into the oceans a year, with this amount set to nearly triple to 29m tonnes a year by 2040 – the equivalent of 50kg for each meter of coastline in the world – if current trends continue. The plastic often breaks down into tiny pieces and is now ubiquitous in our oceans, found from the deepest reaches of the marine world to even sea ice in the Arctic. The Trump administration has blamed countries such as China and Vietnam for pumping large amounts of plastic into the seas but research has suggested the US is the planet’s third largest contributor to marine plastic pollution. United Nations talks were recently held on a new global treaty to tackle plastic pollution but without any signal of support from the US or UK, two of the largest per-capita waste producers in the world. Some jurisdictions within the US have moved to phase out plastic straws or bags – New York is now finally enforcing a ban on plastic bags after a pandemic-related delay – but advocates are hoping to push Joe Biden’s incoming administration to more aggressive national action. “We need to quit blaming other countries and pass laws limiting the use of single-use plastics,” said Warner. “I know Biden is very concerned about climate change and plastic is a huge supplier of greenhouse gases. I’m hoping the US will finally come to the party and do something about this.”"
"Britain has thrown its weight behind a new global agreement to tackle the plastic pollution crisis, which Lord Goldsmith said would go “far beyond” existing international agreements. This week, the Guardian revealed there is growing support for such a treaty internationally, but that neither the UK nor the US, the world’s biggest per capita producers of plastic waste, had yet pledged their support.  The minister for Pacific and the Environment said on Wednesday he believes it is time to start negotiations on a UN treaty on plastics similar to the Paris agreement on the climate crisis. He suggested the UK could provide a leading role in negotiating the terms of such an agreement, as it had with the leaders’ pledge for nature. Speaking via Zoom at a virtual World Trade Organization event, hosted by the UK in collaboration with the Global Plastic Action Partnership, Goldsmith said: “Plastic in the ocean is set to treble by 2025. The challenge we face is immense and urgent. We believe its time to negotiate a new global agreement to coordinate action on marine plastic litter and microplastic, one that goes far beyond the existing frameworks. With two-thirds of UN member states already on board we have a chance now to create an unstoppable momentum to tackle plastic pollution in a way that the Paris agreement has done for climate change and the Montreal protocol has done for ozone depletion. I hope many, many other nations will join us as well.” He spoke of the “ambitious” leaders’ pledge for nature signed in September by 64 world leaders from five continents including Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Jacinda Ardern and Boris Johnson. “I’m proud that the UK played a big role in strengthening that pledge, insisting on the strongest possible language, line by line,” Goldsmith said. The UK will be hosting the G7 and the all-important Cop26 in 2021, he said, and it is committed to doing all it can for nature and to “turn the tide” on plastic waste. Tim Grabiel, a lawyer at the Environmental Investigation Agency, welcomed the UK’s support for a plastics treaty and hoped that the US and Canada would follow its lead. He said: “The UK government is well positioned to lead global efforts and throw its political weight behind an issue so close to the hearts of the British public.” The UN environment assembly concluded in 2017 that the existing international legal framework governing plastic pollution, including the Stockholm and the Basel conventions, is fragmented and ineffective. More than two-thirds of UN member states, including African, Baltic, Caribbean, Nordic and Pacific states, as well as the EU, have said they are open to considering the option of a new agreement. Britain had been considering one of two options: supporting increasing calls for negotiating a new global treaty, or strengthening existing agreements to reduce plastic waste. The US has so far opposed an international agreement on plastic waste. At a UN working group last week to discuss the crisis, which will feed into the fifth UN Environment Assembly in 2021, several delegations voiced support for a new global agreement, although there was no consensus on whether it would address only marine plastic litter or go further to tackle plastics pollution as a whole, and whether it would be legally binding."
"A 10km fence to keep out foxes, deers and cats will be built across the Yanakie isthmus on Victoria’s Wilsons Promontory to create a 50,000-hectare native wildlife sanctuary. The $6m fence is designed to protect vulnerable species including ground parrots, the southern brown bandicoot and long-nosed potoroo in the national park, south-east of Melbourne. Parks Victoria chief conservation scientist Mark Norman said the funding would help reshape the national park into a 50,000-hectare sanctuary. “The development of this predator and deer-proof fence across the narrow entrance to the park allows us to really create a wildlife haven at a huge scale. We’ll stop the wave of feral pests and really protect the special wildlife living there.” The fence will allow Parks Victoria to focus on eradicating any pests or predators inside the park. It will be built deep into the ground and almost 2 metres tall to prevent animals finding a way around, underneath or over it. Norman said that would allow conservationists to maintain the park’s populations of native animals. “The significance of the fence is huge, it’s like creating an island ark where all the native animals and their habitats are protected. It means all the work we do won’t be constantly going backwards with the stream of pests coming in. “It’ll also make an amazing experience for people to connect with nature. It would be like entering a modern Jurassic Park, or a native haven, where the animals bounce back and get the support they need.” The fence is part of a $23m upgrade to facilities, including a new visitor centre, tourism hub and new accomodation, as well as upgrading walking tracks, car parks and existing accommodation. It will turn the park something like an island, according to Matt Ruchel, Executive director at Victorian National Parks Association, protecting the wildlife there. But he said it wasn’t just the fence that would improve the park. “The fence is the iconic bit, but it’s the management following it that’s really important. There needs to be an integrated plan, and you’d hope down the track, you’d be in a position to reintroduce some of those species in a safe space where they can flourish.” “It’ll only work if there is intensive management of those pests in the reserve itself. What it does is then open the door to re-wilding animals and readjusting the ecology.” The Victorian environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the funding boost would help protect the environment and make it easier for more people to enjoy the park. “These are vital investments in conservation that will not only protect the biodiversity that underpins the health of Victoria’s environment but also take carbon out of our atmosphere, an important step in fighting climate change.” Norman told Guardian Australia the funding would go toward improving the walking track, making the facilities safe and more accessible, as well as replacing old “glamping” spots with eco-friendly pods. “I think it’ll engage the public and it’ll be a model for getting more people active in nature conservation and connecting with nature.” Ruchel welcomed the upgrades to visitor facilities, saying they are much needed in this current climate. “We know people are more inspired to visit nature, and we saw it after the first lockdown that there was an explosion in visitation, so the visitation needs to be managed.” “The infrastructure helps with that, but we shouldn’t forget we need core ecological programs to make sure it’s not just the physical assets that are protected, but also that we’re managing the parks to the highest level.” Authorities are hoping that by preventing predators and pests entering the park, they will be able to reintroduce native animals, such as the eastern bristlebird, eastern bettong and the spot-tailed quoll. “By getting rid of the feral pests, we’ll see an amazing bounce-back in endangered birds, endangered ground mammals, their reptiles and frogs. One feral cat can eat up to 5,000 animals a year, so they’re just pigging out on animals wholesale.” Ruchel said he was happy with the funding, and thought it was enough to get the upgrades installled and implemented, but that it wasn’t enough. “It’s good to see the Andrews government recognising the value of our natural areas by making this investment, but in the longer term we need better routine funding for management.” “The problem we have in park management is if its initial funding, it doesn’t always last. There is a question of needing ongoing long term support for these programs so that our ecosystems are managed consistently and for the long term.” Norman hoped the park could act as an emergency shelter for threatened species around the state, especially after last year’s bushfires. “In the bushfires, we almost lost the Victorian eastern bristlebird, and we’re going to set up an insurance population at the Prom, so if another catastrophic fire comes, they don’t go extinct in the state.” “The improvements will really come to show off the jewel in Victoria’s natural estate.”"
"Air pollution in many towns and cities across the UK now exceeds pre-pandemic levels, exacerbating the risk of Covid-19 and putting the health of millions of people at risk.  A study published on Thursday says that although air quality improved dramatically in the first half of the year as the country went into lockdown, pollution now meets or exceeds pre-Covid levels in 80% of the 49 cities and large towns that were analysed. There is growing evidence that exposure to toxic air increases the risks from Covid-19 and the authors of the study say their findings underscore the need for local councils to do more to reduce car use and improve air quality by prioritising walking and cycling. Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities thinktank, which carried out the study, said toxic air contributed to the deaths of thousands of Covid-19 victims this year and, even after the pandemic ended, would remain a big threat to public health – particularly for those living in urban areas. “City leaders can reduce the threat of air pollution, but it will take political will,” said Carter. “Discouraging car usage will be unpopular in the short term but, if coupled with the necessary improvements to public transport, the long-term benefits to public health and the economy will be huge and our cities will become better places to live in. Now is not the time for politicians to delay on this.” The study’s findings, based on an analysis of the latest data from Defra, reveal that while the spring lockdown reduced nitrogen dioxide levels by 38% on average across 49 cities and large towns, pre-pandemic levels had been reached or exceeded in four-fifths of the places studied during the second half of 2020. The authors say the surge in toxic air has been driven by a rise in the use of private cars and has happened even though 98% of the country remains under significant Covid-19 restrictions. This raises concerns that as those measures are eased in the new year, air quality will worsen even further, with dire consequences for public health. Since the pandemic hit, many local authorities have tried to encourage walking and cycling by building cycle lanes and creating low-traffic neighbourhoods to stop drivers “rat-running” through residential areas. But these efforts have faced vocal opposition from the pro-car lobby and some disgruntled drivers. Some councils have already backed down, pulling up new cycle lanes, while others shelved long-term plans to install low-emission zones, arguing that pollution levels had already fallen due to the lockdown. But Hubert Thieriot, from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said the new study highlighted the need for local leaders across the country to step up their efforts to limit the use of private cars as the country emerged from lockdown restrictions. He said the pandemic had caused “immense suffering both on sanitary and social fronts” but it had also reminded the public “that air pollution is not a given, and that bold actions on transportation could significantly improve people’s health and quality of life”. “The role of transportation in UK cities’ air pollution has become apparent to everyone during the Covid-related lockdowns,” Thieriot said. “That shared awareness offers policymakers a historical chance to implement bold transportation policies.”"
"The spread of a facial cancer that ravaged the Tasmanian devil population has slowed due to the animal’s “amazing evolutionary response”, increasing its chance of survival, new research suggests. An international team of scientists used a genomic tool typically used to track viruses such as Covid-19 to monitor the spread of the transmissable cancer that has led to devil numbers crashing by more than 80% over the past two decades. Called devil facial tumour disease, or DFTD, the unusual illness is passed between animals by biting. There was concern a decade ago that it could lead to the marsupial’s extinction as it moved into populations across most of the island state. But a new paper in the respected journal Science says the spread of the cancer has slowed – the curve has flattened – and it is now thought unlikely to wipe out the endangered species. Prof Andrew Storfer, a biologist from Washington State University in the US who led the research, said the results were “cautiously optimistic good news”. “I think we’re going to see continued survival of devils – initially at lower numbers and densities than original population sizes, but extinction seems really unlikely even though it was predicted a decade ago,” he said in a statement. The study expands on earlier work led by Dr Rodrigo Hamede, a disease ecologist at the University of Tasmania, which suggested a handful of devils had developed a natural immune response to the disease. The new paper found that while DFTD was still usually fatal, the reproduction number of cases from each primary case had fallen from a high of about 3.5 to less than one. The authors concluded devils were likely to have rapidly evolved to tolerate and possibly resist the cancer, and could now exist in a “steady state” with it. They screened more than 11,000 genes from tumour samples collected over nearly 20 years using a genomic approach known as phylodynamics, which allowed analysis of changes in DNA to track the evolution of the disease through the population. The researchers said there was increasing evidence some devils could recover from DFTD, which was not the case in its early incarnation. There are believed to be about 10,000 left in the wild. Hamede, a co-author on the latest study, said he was amazed at the pace at which devils had evolved in response to DFTD. “These things just don’t happen in four or five generations, they take a lot longer than that,” he said. “This new research shows evidence that the epidemic reached its peak a while ago. We expect in the future devils are going to be making a comeback.” The researchers said the results raised doubts about the future of programs that exist to release captive-bred devils into the wild, given breeding between animals exposed to the disease and those raised in captivity could slow or reverse the tumour-resistant evolution of the wild population. Hamede said these sort of programs should only be undertaken only if it was clear the benefits were greater than allowing populations to recover through natural selection. Storfer said: “Active management may not be necessary and could actually be harmful.”"
"In some rare good news from the top of the world, bowhead whale populations have rebounded and are nearing pre-commercial whaling numbers in US waters. Surprisingly, the whales’ recovery has actually accelerated as the Arctic warms, according to an update on the species published this week by the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration. “This is really one of the great conservation successes of the last century,” said J Craig George, a retired biologist with the North Slope borough department of wildlife management. Bowhead whales – the only baleen whale that lives in the Arctic year-round – were once on the brink of disappearing forever. The population near Alaska was targeted by commercial whalers beginning in the 1700s for their oil, blubber and baleen. Their large, rotund bodies and slow-moving nature made them easy targets, and they were nearly hunted to extinction by the turn of the 20th century. Once commercial whaling ceased, the western Arctic population living in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas began to rebound. The whales’ recovery has been in large part thanks to the natural inaccessibility of their ice-covered home, which has shielded them from commercial shipping and fishing activities that threaten their right whale cousins to the south. George also credits sustainable management and stewardship of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission (AEWC), who have fought against offshore oil drilling and other activities that could harm the species. “No one has fought harder than the AEWC to protect bowhead habitat from industrial development in the US Arctic,” George said. Researchers work with Alaska native communities such as the Inupiat of Utqiaġvik, Alaska, who have hunted the whales at sustainable levels for at least 1,000 years, to monitor and study the species. “The general understanding of cetacean biology, anatomy and physiology and ecology has been greatly enhanced in the partnership with indigenous hunters,” George said. “It was the Inupiat captains that taught us how to properly count whales.” Bowhead whales can provide broader insights into Arctic marine ecosystem health. The species’ longevity and sensitivity to annual fluctuations help biologists track changes in the Arctic over long periods of time. Bowhead whales’ accelerated population expansion in recent decades has come as a surprise to biologists, who expected the cold-adapted whale species to suffer from the melting sea ice. Bowheads are highly specialized to their Arctic environment, with a pronounced bump on their heads used to break ice and blubber over a foot and a half (half a meter) thick. So far, however, the whales have proven resilient in the face of dramatic changes and have even benefited in unexpected ways. The Arctic is becoming more productive as temperatures rise and more light reaches the ocean surface layer where sea ice is thinner or absent. Less ice and more nutrients flowing north from the Bering Sea have led to an increase in bowhead whale foods like krill and copepods in northern latitudes. These changes have been helpful to bowheads around Alaska, resulting in fatter whales and more babies, according to Noaa. Bowheads have also been able to expand their territory north into waters where the ice was once too thick for them to break. While the western Arctic population was hunted down to just a few thousand individuals by the end of commercial whaling, they had rebounded to about 10,000 individuals by the turn of the 21st century and now number at least 16,800. But the species’ fate is far from certain as the Arctic rapidly transforms. Their thick blubber, which provides insulation against frigid icy waters, could become a disadvantage during warmer summers. They are also more likely to get tangled in fishing gear, face competition for food from other baleen whales, and attacked by their only natural predators – orcas – as the ice retreats and can no longer shield them. “They really are headed into an uncertain future,” George said."
"A leading scientist has told an inquest there is no evidence that a nine-year-old girl was admitted to hospital with acute asthma complications when levels of air pollution were higher. Paul Wilkinson, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told a coroner he had analysed levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter on the days during her lifetime when Ella Kissi-Debrah had contact with, or was admitted to, hospital. He told the hearing at Southwark coroner’s court he had found no evidence to support the theory that Ella’s condition worsened to the point of requiring hospitalisation at times when air pollution was higher. “It’s a complicated thing to determine, no thing is entirely unequivocal,” he said “… What I set out to test was whether days of hospital admission were also days of higher air pollution. “Because if ambient pollution were a prominent driver of her condition you would expect to see that she was more likely to go to hospital when air pollution levels were high and less likely when air pollution levels were low. “The bottom line is there was no clear evidence that days of hospital admission or contact had higher concentrations or higher pollution than other days.” He concluded: “It doesn’t exclude the fact that air pollution may have been a contribution to some degree but it wasn’t a very determining effect.” Wilkinson said there was no doubt that Ella, who lived 25 metres from the South Circular road in London, was being exposed to higher than average levels of pollutants during her lifetime. “The South Circular is a busy road and she was within 30 metres of it. And levels from a main road by 30 metres are still above background levels,” he said. “So she was likely to be having above average [exposure] even within London.” Wilkinson said at the time Ella was ill – between 2010 and 2013 – it was clear and not disputed scientifically that air pollution was a factor in the exacerbation of the disease from day to day. “That has been recognised for probably about 15 years.” But he said it was a less dominant factor than allergens and respiratory infections. Air pollution, he said, was a stronger influence for some people than others, but it was not possible to identify which asthma sufferers would be more sensitive to air pollution than others. “Looking very carefully at the levels [of air pollution] there was nothing there in her case,” Wilkinson said. The inquest has heard that illegal levels of air pollution in the area where Ella lived and died should have been treated as a public health emergency. In a landmark legal case, the coroner Philip Barlow is being asked to rule that air pollution caused the death from an acute asthma attack of the primary school pupil in February 2013, a finding that would make legal history. It has never been identified as a cause of death before in the UK and this is thought to be the first case of its kind in the world. Ella’s mother, Rosamund, told the hearing on Monday that had she known about the impact of air pollution on her daughter’s illness, she would have moved house immediately. The hearing continues."
"Money made available for wildlife conservation by the EU is based on a popularity contest, with vertebrates getting nearly 500 times more funding for each species than invertebrates, according to a new report. Brown bears, wolves, bitterns and Eurasian lynxes are the Hollywood stars of European conservation and receive almost the same amount as all invertebrates put together, according to analysis of funding under the EU’s Habitats Directive. This leaves little for less charismatic creatures such as spiders and crustaceans, many of which are crucial to ecosystem health and at greater risk of extinction, the study found. The paper, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, is the latest to show that invertebrates are being overlooked by conservation efforts, which usually focus on more eye-catching birds and mammals. A team led by Stefano Mammola, a cave ecologist at the Italian National Research Council, analysed the EU’s Life programme – which funds climate and environment action– between 1992 and 2018 to see how money was allocated. The study found that 23% of Europe’s vertebrates received funding compared with 0.06% of invertebrates. In total, vertebrates attracted €970m (£880m), six times more than the €150m for invertebrates. “The data was amazing in terms of how much bears, wolves, and a few birds got in terms of funding,” said Mammola. “The bias operates at different levels within mammals – you have a few species that get everything. There is only one spider included in the Habitats Directive, a few crustaceans, and not a single parasite.” The risk of extinction did not seem to influence how much money a species received. The brown bear and grey wolf received the most money: €47m and €33m. Both animals are “of least concern”, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The rate of extinction in insects is eight times faster than that of birds, mammals and reptiles, according to analysis published last year, with known declines likely to be the “tip of the iceberg”. The findings are released as the EU creates its biodiversity strategy for the next decade, with the aim of protecting 30% of land for nature by 2030, with an estimated budget of €20bn. The paper outlines a strategy for fair spending in the coming decade, and a recent EU proposal suggests it will try to account more for invertebrates in the Life programme. “We should have reached a point, in my opinion, where we do not have to explain why protecting biodiversity is important,” said Mammola. “I see the point of attracting people using charismatic species, I’m not denying that, but I think there are also lots of charismatic species in the invertebrate world. We need to change the perception of what’s charismatic and illustrate the larger diversity of what’s there.” Most species are declining, but investment in species-level conservation can reverse these trends. One of the biggest conservation successes has been the return of large carnivores such as wolverine and lynx across Europe. Sometimes, protecting “umbrella species” such as beavers or wolves benefits habitats more broadly, but this is not always the case. “The problem is that invertebrates have very different ecological needs to mammals – but the spatial niche of a spider or a beetle is totally different. You need to protect microhabitats and other elements that you don’t get when you’re protecting a wolf, for example,” he said. Putting more emphasis on protecting specific habitats such as decaying wood or aquatic systems could protect many rare invertebrates simultaneously. Extinction risk was assessed using the IUCN database, and public interest in a species was measured by scanning Google searches between January 2010 and December 2019. The top 30 invertebrates supported by Life funds were beetles, butterflies and dragonflies (large and colourful species seemed to do the best), but their funding was “minuscule” compared with funds for vertebrates, researchers wrote. Using Life project funding as a proxy for assessing spending on the conservation of different organisms is not straightforward because there are other mechanisms for nature conservation across the EU, said Prof Steve Ormerod, an ecologist at Cardiff University, who was not involved in the study. “A key finding, nevertheless, is that spending through this scheme has been biased towards ‘charismatic’ vertebrates (often mammals and birds) rather than invertebrates. While this strategy will have inevitably also benefited smaller organisms that live under the ‘umbrella’ of bird, mammal or fish habitats, there is clearly a case to ramp up protection and support for smaller organisms,” he said. Providing an unbiased European conservation agenda was an important aim, agreed Prof Michael Samways, an entomologist from Stellenbosch University, who was not involved in the research. “As human beings, we naturally gravitate to the feathery and the furry. This paper gets to the heart of this issue – biodiversity is not just vertebrates, it’s about invertebrates, and of course it’s about all the microorganisms as well as the fungi and so on. It’s really about making sure we can save life in its entirety,” he said.

"Microplastic pollution has been discovered in snow close to the peak of Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain. With plastic debris revealed in 2018 at the deepest point on Earth, the Mariana Trench, it is now clear that humanity’s litter has polluted the entire planet. The tiny plastic fibres were found within a few hundred metres of the top of the 8,850-metre mountain, at a spot known as the balcony. Microplastics were found in all the snow samples collected from 11 locations on Everest, ranging from 5,300 metres to 8,440 metres high. The highest concentrations of microplastics were found around Base Camp, where climbers and trekkers spend the most time. The fibres were most likely to have come from the clothing, tents and ropes used by mountaineers, the scientists said. Other recent discoveries of microplastic pollution in remote parts of the Swiss Alps and French Pyrenees indicate the particles can also be carried by the wind from further afield. “It really surprised me to find microplastics in every single snow sample I analysed,” said Imogen Napper, at the University of Plymouth, who led the new research. “Mount Everest is somewhere I have always considered remote and pristine. To know we are polluting near the top of the tallest mountain is a real eye-opener.” “With microplastics so ubiquitous in our environment, it’s time to focus on appropriate environmental solutions,” she said. “We need to protect and care for our planet.” Reducing, reusing and recycling larger items of plastic waste is important, Napper said, as they can be broken down into microplastics when discarded into the environment. But many microplastics are shed from clothing made from synthetic fabrics, and she said a focus on better fabrics was needed, as well as using natural fibres such as cotton when possible. Millions of tonnes of plastic are lost into the environment every year. It can contain toxic additives and carry harmful microbes and is known to injure wildlife that mistake it for food. People also consume microplastics via food and water, and breathe them in, although the health impact is not yet known. There have been longstanding concerns about litter on Everest, which was climbed by at least 880 people in 2019. But the new study is the first to assess microplastic pollution, which is less than 5mm in size and therefore too small to be picked up. The study, published in the journal One Earth, analysed samples collected by a National Geographic expedition in 2019. The scientists found an average of 30 microplastic particles per litre of water in the snow samples and 119 particles per litre in the most contaminated sample. They also assessed stream water samples from eight locations, but only three had microplastics, perhaps as the streams were able to wash away contamination. In her previous work, Napper has found that each cycle of a washing machine can release 700,000 microscopic plastic fibres, and that plastic bags that claim to be biodegradable were still intact after three years in the natural environment."
"When walking down the track to the estuary for my hour’s exercise, I picked up a feather from the green verge. It was delicately fringed, mottled brown, velvety – a tawny owl’s primary. I swished it through the air to admire its soundlessness, stuck it in my hatband, strolled on by the seawall to the millpool at Ynys where clamorous redshank roost. None were present. The only noisemakers around were a rackety mob of small birds – great tits, house sparrows – that darted in and out of sparse foliage on a great oak by the muddy path to Llanfihangel y Traethau. Focusing my glass, there, sure enough, the brindled presence of a sleeping tawny owl. By Traeth Bach again the following evening, with a bag of scraps from the Penrhyn butcher in my pocket, I sat on a great slate block by the end of the track to watch the scudding birdlife that accompanies each turn of the tide. This is my cynefin, my milltir sgwâr. For 50 years, I’ve lived around this estuary, and I know and love it as well as anywhere on the planet. From this rock I can look across the Afon Dwyryd to my old house, invoking memories of the fallen owlet that I reared in my workroom there and reintroduced into the wild 30 years ago. I laid out scraps of meat on a nearby rock, cupped my hands and, like Wordsworth’s Boy, “Blew mimic hootings” to the owls in the oak woods of the farther shore. Did “my” owl still live among those trees? Certainly I, and my late friend and neighbour Jonah Jones the sculptor, saw her often after she’d returned to the wild. Records exist of owls living to a considerable age, though few do. In the oldest extant Welsh story, Culhwch ac Olwen, the owl of Cwm Cawlwyd is third oldest among all creatures. So I sat and waited and hooted on. A sound from over my right shoulder! A hundred yards away on a fence post perched a tawny owl, devouring a chunk of meat from the slate below. She, or one of her granddaughters, had come. I summoned again. She answered with a shriek, and fed on."
"Malcolm Shabazz Hoover is rattling off his vegetable varieties to two potential customers from a local restaurant. “It’s called Brassica juncea, a west African mustard green,” Hoover says to Marissa Lorette and Ian Watson, co-owners of BeesWing, a local restaurant looking to work with Black businesses. He picks some from the ground and offers it to them. “Taste it.” “It’s sweet and spicy,” Watson says, looking pleased and happily confused, and Black Futures Farm bags another client. This brings the number of entities to which it sells produce through the city’s Community Supported Agriculture program to 17 – in less than a year of operation. I have come to meet Hoover on his micro farms at Portland State University’s Learning Gardens Laboratory. I’ve known this Black naval reserve vet for many years – and the silver-haired 50-year-old has, at times, been one of the most restive and unstable of my Portland associates. When I heard he had turned to farming, I had to see it for myself. As we walk along the immaculate rows of kale, I still cannot believe he has raised this produce from seeds to maturity. The Hoover I knew carried a whiff of self-destructiveness; this one radiates cultivation energy. In the imagination of Black America, farming has existed as a centuries-long, government-enacted crime scene. Now Hoover’s fledgling business, and others like it, are part of a nationwide movement seeking to address the systemic racism denying Black people land and food sovereignty. Predating Black Lives Matter, this movement has found its profile amplified during the latest protests and calls for justice after the murder of George Floyd. Small and independent, these farms produce the fresh food lacking in many communities of color and – most profoundly – restore a rightful heritage. It is a remixing of a broken song about the soil and the relationship of Black Americans to it. There were more than 900,000 Black farmers in the US in 1920, but of the country’s 3.4 million total farmers, just 45,000 are Black according to the 2017 Census of Agriculture. That’s just over 1% of farmers, despite Black or African American people making up 13% of the population. In 1997, a class discrimination lawsuit was filed, Pigford v Glickman, which would find that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) had discriminated against Black farmers from 1983 to 1997. Its controversial settlement injected $1bn (£740m) into Black farming, but dragged on for years. A paucity of Black-owned farms means a dearth of healthy food right in the middle of communities of color, which often lack decent supermarkets and fresh produce. According to a report from the National Institutes of Health studying trends in food insecurity from 2001 to 2016, “food insecurity rates for both non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic households were at least twice that of non-Hispanic white households.” Covid-19 has given food justice issues new urgency, as food insecurity rates among households with children have “sharply elevated – particularly so among Black and Hispanic respondents,” according to the Northwestern Institute for Policy Research. But here in Oregon things are changing. “The interest in urban farming has grown threefold” in this region, says Eddie Hill, co-director of the Black Food Sovereignty Coalition, a nonprofit organization that works with BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) growers. The number of Black-owned farms within 50 miles of Portland has doubled from eight to 16 during the last five years. Hoover tells me that he came to micro-farming the way so many others have: through networking and on-site learning. While working at the Oregon Food Bank he met Art Shaver and Shantae Johnson, who invited him to visit their farm, Mudbone Grown. He put himself to work. Shaver and Johnson are at right at the heart of some of the changes taking place here; the couple’s Pathways to Farming training program is well known throughout the area. After talking to Hoover, I want to find out more about this new wave of farmers, and so I go to meet them on their eight-hectare (20-acre) farm in the lush hills outside of Portland. Sitting inside an industrial-size tent, light rain tapping, they tell me they had wanted to farm for years. If you shake an African American family tree, a farmer is bound to fall out of it. Hoover has family who were land stewards in Texas and Tennessee. Johnson, 42, and Shaver, 46, grew up farming. Johnson’s grandmother had a seven-acre farm in Oregon City that would visit; Shaver’s grandmother had a small farm in Texas. His job was to ladle boiled fish guts, a rich soil additive, among her rows of carrots and cabbage. It made them feel grounded. “We just wanted to have some land, work it with our kids,” says Johnson, a gentle, curly haired woman who is on the Oregon Board of Agriculture. “We started talking about homesteading like our ancestors did,” adds the lean, bespectacled Shaver, two-dozen chicks in a box at our feet.  The couple, who now have six children, discounted farming because of the racism that meant farmland was passed down from white family to white family and denied to people of color. But they kept going back to the dream. In 2016, they cobbled together $5,000 to join Oregon State University’s Beginning Urban Farmer Apprenticeship, an eight-month training program for aspiring farmers. They left it halfway through. “Some of the stuff I was paying to learn I had already been exposed to through my grandparents,” says Shaver. “We were like: ‘Let’s quit and go out and do this on our own.’” Even with access to land, farming is prohibitively expensive. The couple scrambled to make it work, using food stamps to buy seeds and starts to grew bushels of food in a garden at their Portland rental apartment. There, they began to teach school-age children about land sustainability and to share skills that could help them in the job market. In 2017, the Oregon Food Bank offered them more acreage in Portland. They also launched the Pathways to Farming incubator program, designed to teach agriculture to prospective farmers. In 2019, they leased their current peri-rural space. His and Johnson’s place lies in the lush green hills of Oregon. The winding paths between properties in this setting calls lots of things to mind. Slavery is not one of them. A commitment to teaching others is crucial to the continued growth of Black farming. At the moment, there seems to be no shortage of people eager to learn. When Mudbone expanded last year, 99 Black Oregonians applied for its 10 open positions. When I revisit Black Futures Farm to see how Hoover is doing, he tells me a group of five volunteers have showed him how to build a needed irrigation system. “Having regular water … is the earmark of a serious farmer,” says Hoover. “When I [first] thought about working on a farm, I was like: ‘Shit, that’s like slavery.’ “Working out in a hot field for hours and hours at a time, that’s what I equated farming with. Now, having my own farm has taken me much further back than slavery. I’m an African.”  This article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.

"Nearly all soya is used by the farming sector as a livestock feed for chickens, pigs and other animals. The biggest users are chicken producers; soya makes up around a quarter of the diet of birds. It has been the cheapest source of protein poultry available to farmers since the ban on meat and bonemeal after BSE. Soya remains key to producing fast-growing, low-priced chickens. Alternatives such as lentils or other legumes are more expensive and less available to farmers. Some poultry farmers have been experimenting with adding black soldier fly larvae to the diets of their birds, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimating that insects could replace between 25 and 100% of soymeal for chickens. However, at present insects are seen as a supplement, rather than a replacement, for soya.“[Soya is] our achilles heel. It’s the best pound for pound source of protein so it’s hard to convince farmers to move away from it,” chicken farmer Charles Mears told the Guardian last month. Soya is a smaller part of the diet of other farmed animals and appears to be easier to replace. For example, dairy farmers supplying M&S recently eliminated their use of soya, replacing it with rapeseed oil and sugar beet.  The vast majority of soya is grown in Argentina, Brazil and the US, which between them account for 80% of global production. Two of those countries – Argentina and Brazil – have serious risks of deforestation in soya production, and also provide most of the soya used by UK farmers. There is a small but growing supply of soya produced in Europe, but it is not yet competitive with producers in the Americas. It is currently more profitable for European farmers to grow alternative crops to soya. The main sources of organic soya are China, India, the US and Russia. Retailers are linked through their supply chains to deforestation because they buy meat and dairy products from UK farmers who use soya. In response to pressure, they have come out with a variety of policies that attempt to limit or eliminate links with deforestation. Most of them do this by committing to ensuring that their suppliers only use “responsibly-sourced” soya, relying on a range of certification schemes to deliver on this. There is no internationally-agreed definition of responsibly- or sustainably-sourced soya. Instead it is left to individual private certification schemes such as the Roundtable on Responsible Soy, which states that it guarantees zero deforestation and zero conversion in its certified soya production. But such schemes have different tiers of certification. The most basic tier involves buying offsets for soya in their supply chain. The money goes to support farmers producing soya responsibly, but the soya in the supply chain is not necessarily responsibly-sourced. Aldi and McDonald’s are among companies that say they use credits.The next tier up works on the basis of what is known as “area mass balance”. Certified soya is mixed up with non-certified soya, but the amount of certified soya is tracked. So while the actual soya you buy may not be certified, you create a market for certified ‘responsibly sourced’ soya by buying it through this tier. Tesco has said all of its soya will be covered by this tier by the end of 2020. The highest tier is buying only segregated soya, which means the soya comes from a certified source and is kept separate from other non-certified soya throughout its journey along the supply chain to farmers. Sainsbury’s has said it will work with its suppliers of fresh chicken, pork, eggs and aquaculture to only source area mass balance or segregated soya by 2023. Waitrose has set the same target for its suppliers by the end of 2020. The UK government has agreed to introduce new rules requiring companies to prove they have checked for risks of illegal deforestation in their supply chains. Companies would also be banned from sourcing commodities, including soya, that have not been produced in line with the laws of countries where they originate. A consultation on the proposals concluded last month. Details about the due diligence that firms will have to undertake to ensure products are deforestation-free have not yet been announced. It is also unclear if compliance with local laws would be enough to guarantee that soya has no links with deforestation. In Brazil, for example, president Jair Bolsonaro has disputed data on deforestation and called for further development of the Amazon region.“The only way supermarkets and fast food companies will actually achieve deforestation-free supply chains is by reducing the amount of meat they sell, not by replacing soya with other feeds, or by paying certification schemes,” said Anna Jones, head of forests at Greenpeace. “Feeding plant proteins to animals to produce meat is hugely inefficient and uses far more land across the world than we have to spare.”"
"For thousands of years, the dainty Fritillaria delavayi has grown slowly on the rocky slopes of the Hengduan mountains in China, producing a bright green flower after its fifth year. But the conspicuous small plant has one deadly enemy: people, who harvest the flower for traditional Chinese medicine. As commercial harvesting has intensified, Fritillaria delavayi has vanished – by rapidly evolving to produce grey and brown leaves and flowers that cannot be so easily seen by pickers. Scientists have discovered that the colour of the plant’s leaves has become more camouflaged – matching the background rocks on which they grow – in areas where there is more harvesting pressure from people. “Like other camouflaged plants we have studied, we thought the evolution of camouflage of this fritillary had been driven by herbivores, but we didn’t find such animals,” said Dr Yang Niu, of the Kunming Institute of Botany, and co-author of the study in Current Biology. “Then we realised humans could be the reason.” In the study by the Kunming Institute of Botany (Chinese Academy of Sciences) and the University of Exeter, researchers measured how closely plants from different populations matched their mountain environment and how easy they were to collect, and interviewed local people to estimate how much harvesting took place in each location. In a computer experiment, people were found to take more time to discover the more-camouflaged plants, suggesting that humans are driving the rapid evolution of this species into new colour forms because better-camouflaged plants have a higher chance of survival. Fritillaria delavayi is a perennial herb that grows leaves at a young age before producing a single flower after its fifth year every June. The bulb of the fritillary species has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years but high prices in recent years have led to increased harvesting. “It’s remarkable to see how humans can have such a direct and dramatic impact on the colouration of wild organisms, not just on their survival but on their evolution itself,” said Prof Martin Stevens, of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter. “Many plants seem to use camouflage to hide from herbivores that may eat them – but here we see camouflage evolving in response to human collectors. “It’s possible that humans have driven evolution of defensive strategies in other plant species, but surprisingly little research has examined this.”"
"The vast majority of protected landscapes across Europe are rated as in poor or bad condition and vital species and their habitats continue to decline despite targets aimed at protecting them, according to a report. Only a quarter of Europe’s species are rated as having a good conservation status, while 80% of key habitats are rated as being in poor or bad condition across the continent, in the State of Nature in the EU 2013-2018 assessment by the European Environment Agency. Just under half of all bird species are thriving, at 47%, but this is a decline of five percentage points since 2015, showing that the trend is going in the wrong direction. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, said: “[This] shows very clearly that we are still losing our vital life support system. We urgently need to deliver on the commitments in the new EU biodiversity strategy to reverse this decline for the benefit of nature, people, climate and the economy.” Much of the blame for the poor condition of Europe’s natural environment lies with intensive farming. The EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP) tends to reward intensive farming, despite moves to reward farmers for some measures that prioritise the environment. “The pressures on nature are much greater than the solutions we are currently providing,” said Micheal O’Briain, of the European commission’s nature protection unit. “Agriculture on balance is still putting huge pressure on nature.” Reforms that would reward farmers for doing more for the environment are under discussion, as part of the “farm to fork” strategy and the European Green Deal, but some face opposition from farmers’ groups in some member states. “I would not pretend this is going to be an easy debate [on CAP reform] as we have somehow to reconcile different objectives,” O’Briain said. Key votes on CAP reform will take place this week in the European parliament, but two of the largest groupings of MEPs on the political right have come together to reject many of the measures that would prioritise environmental protections. Jabier Ruiz, senior policy officer at WWF, said: “As it stands, the future of the CAP looks grim. Neither council nor parliament appear to care about the climate and biodiversity crises as they strip away conditions for farm subsidies and push for greenwashing loopholes. Policy-makers must hit the emergency brakes and change direction before it is too late.” Campaigners are also calling for member states’ environment ministers to endorse the EU’s 2030 biodiversity strategy later in the week. The EU’s habitats directive lists 233 key habitat types, covering nearly a third of the EU’s land area, and only 15% of these are rated as in good condition. Coastal habitats, dunes and bog, mire and fen come out worst, according to Europe’s environment watchdog, though forest habitats are faring slightly better. There has been little sign of improvement over most of the past decade, despite EU targets. Overall, about a third of listed habitats are in an unfavourable condition and deteriorating, with a similar number unfavourable but stable. Among species types, reptiles and vascular plants are faring best, though half are still rated as in poor or bad condition, while the fate of mammals is showing improvement but for about half of fish species the outlook is unfavourable and deteriorating. There are a few bright spots. Rewilding in some areas has brought wolves back as far as Germany and Belgium, though not without concerns from farmers and rural communities. Some bird species, such as the red kite and crane, have been improving markedly, and there has been good news for the ruddy shelduck and black guillemot. Sweden’s agile frog is on the up, as is the bearded vulture across the continent. The EEA also singled out the Italian wall lizard, the horseshoe whip snake, the hairy agrimony and the great yellow gentian as conservation success stories. Hans Bruyninckx, executive director of the EEA, called on EU member states to do more to reach the bloc’s biodiversity targets. “Our assessment shows that safeguarding the health and resilience of Europe’s nature, and people’s wellbeing, requires fundamental changes to the way we produce and consume food, manage and use forests, and build cities,” he said. “These efforts need to be coupled with better implementation and enforcement of conservation policies, a focus on nature restoration, as well as increasingly ambitious climate action, especially in the transport and energy sector.” Agriculture is not the only problem: a lack of water in some areas, urbanisation and pollution are also harming wildlife and plants. Forestry is also showing mixed impacts, as some forests are thriving but in some areas forest management and clear-cutting are destroying habitats. Birds face the additional pressure of hunting, which still accounts for at least 52 million bird deaths a year, and fish populations are under pressure from the common fisheries policy, reforms to which have not been fully implemented despite the 2020 deadline in law for bringing fishing quotas into line with scientific advice. The assessment, published on Monday, was based on the work of 200,000 people, of whom about 60% were volunteers, reporting data to the EEA, and represents the largest dataset on nature ever compiled in Europe. The UK will no longer be bound by the EU directives under Brexit, and is leaving the common agricultural policy. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said: “We are moving to a fairer system now we have left the EU, with our agriculture bill fulfilling our ambitious plans for a system based on the principle of public money for public goods, such as improving air and water quality and driving biodiversity. We have consulted on this and have announced our intention to start phasing out the existing, unfair direct payment system in England from 2021.”"
"Sightings of sea turtles around the coasts of the UK and Ireland are showing signs of decline, scientists say, although it is unclear what is behind the drop. Researchers say an analysis of a multi-agency database has revealed that between 1910 and 2018 there were 1,997 records of sightings, strandings or capture of turtles – alive or dead – with 84% relating to leatherback turtles. Other species recorded included green turtles, Kemp’s ridley turtles and an olive ridley turtle, a small species that favours tropical waters, which was stranded on Anglesey, Wales, in 2016. While leatherback turtles come to UK waters looking for jellyfish, loggerheads and Kemp’s ridley turtles are transported into the area on currents from the Caribbean or North Atlantic. However, the team behind the study say the records show concerning trends. Among their findings, they say reports of leatherback turtles increased over the decades to a peak in the 1990s, but since then records appear to have gradually declined. While there were 553 instances in the 1990s, there were 464 in the 2000s and 256 since 2010 – although the data for the most recent decade is not yet complete. The team suggest the uptick in earlier decades could be down to a true rise in turtle numbers, greater awareness of reporting schemes, warmer waters or even an increase in prey. Likewise, Zara Botterell, lead author of the study from the University of Exeter, said the apparent decline could be down to many different factors. “It could be climate change [or] prey availability, but it could also be reporting,” she said, noting there has been a decrease in the number of fishing boats operating in the UK – a key source for turtle sightings.  The study, published in the Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, also reveals records of Kemp’s ridley turtles have increased since the 1980s, although they, too, have seen a recent decline, albeit only in the past couple of years. The team say the uptick for this species could be a result of conservation efforts in the US and Mexico to protect turtle nests and prevent nesting females being caught in shrimp nets. Their subsequent drop in numbers, they add, might be linked to the Deepwater horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 – a core part of the turtles’ range – among other factors, including a decline in observers."
"A Danish vaccine specialist has warned that a new wave of coronavirus could be started by the Covid-19 mink variant. “The worst-case scenario is that we would start off a new pandemic in Denmark. There’s a risk that this mutated virus is so different from the others that we’d have to put new things in a vaccine and therefore [the mutation] would slam us all in the whole world back to the start,” said Prof Kåre Mølbak, vaccine expert and director of infectious diseases at Denmark’s State Serum Institute (SSI). He added, however, that the world was in a better place than when the Covid-19 outbreak began.“We know the virus, have measures in place including testing and infection control, and the outbreak will be contained, to the best of our knowledge.” Denmark, the world’s largest mink producer, said on Wednesday that it plans to cull more than 15 million of the animals, due to fears that a Covid-19 mutation moving from mink to humans could jeopardise future vaccines. Announcing the cull, the country’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said 12 people were already infected with the mutated virus and mink are now considered a public health risk, based on advice from the SSI. Prof Allan Randrup Thomsen, a virologist at the University of Copenhagen, went further, telling the Guardian on Thursday that while Denmarkwas not “on the verge of being the next Wuhan” there were risks. “This variant can develop further, so that it becomes completely resistant, and then a vaccine does not matter. Therefore, we need to take [the mutation] out of the equation. So it’s serious.” In interviews with Danish media, Thomsen advised shutting down northern Denmark due to the risks from mink farms, a task made easier by the Limfjord, which cuts across northern Jutland. Although bridges across the fjord remain open, all restaurants, pubs, cafes and sports activities in the area will close shortly. A Dutch virologist and zoonosis expert, Wim van der Poel, said more research was needed but that even without the mutation, a reservoir of the virus in mink or others of the mustelid family such as badgers and martens was to be avoided. “It seems the mink-variant mutation is found in the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, but we don’t really know. And we don’t know what kind of vaccine we are going to have. So a lot more research is needed,” said Van der Poel. But even without a mutation, the continuing circulation within mink herds may pose a risk to humans. “We assume [this] is a risk too in the Netherlands, but our fur farming is being phased out already. There’s no more fur production now after the end of this year,” he said. Van der Poel is currently looking at the effect of Covid-19 spreading to mustelids, a family of carnivorous mammals including weasels, badgers, otters, ferrets, martens and wolverines, among others. “ If that happened, then you have a reservoir in our local wildlife, and we could get reinfected before we even get a good quality vaccine.” Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: “The idea that the virus mutates in a new species is not surprising as it must adapt to be able to use mink receptors to enter cells and so will modify the spike protein to enable this to happen efficiently. “The danger is that the mutated virus could then spread back into man and evade any vaccine response which would have been designed to the original, non-mutated version of the spike protein, and not the mink-adapted version. Of course, the mink version may not transmit well to man, so it’s a theoretical risk but Denmark is clearly taking a precautionary stance in aiming to eradicate the mink version so that this possibility is avoided or made much less likely.” Jussi Peura, research director of the Finnish Fur Breeders’ Association and animal geneticist, was more sanguine. He said he understood the worry in Denmark, but felt the decision to carry out a cull might have been too extreme. Instead, he suggested continuing with the control measures that were working in Finland. “Right now we have zero cases in fur farms in Finland. We have a total of about 700 fur farms and of those about 150 are mink, all Covid-19-free so far.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"Discarded masks and other items of personal protective equipment were found on nearly a third of beaches surveyed by beach-cleaning volunteers this autumn. The Marine Conservation Society’s annual beach clean found items of PPE on 30% of the areas they cleaned up. The most common items of pollution found in coastal areas were pieces of plastic or polystyrene, plastic takeaway cup lids, and wet wipes. Volunteers carried out beach cleans in 385 coastal areas in September, covering 43,958 metres of beach. This year, due to the coronavirus crisis, PPE featured for the first time on the beaches surveyed. Masks and gloves were also found by volunteers in 69% of inland litter picks. Lizzie Prior, the Great British Beach Clean coordinator at the Marine Conservation Society, said: “The amount of PPE our volunteers found on beaches and inland this year is of concern. Considering mask-wearing was only made mandatory in shops in England in late July, little more than three months before the Great British Beach Clean, the sharp increase in PPE litter should be a warning for what could be a new form of litter polluting our beaches in the future.” Like many other single-use items, disposable face masks and gloves posed a threat to wildlife on land and at sea, she said. Marine animals could mistake face masks and gloves for prey, filling their stomachs with materials that will not break down and could prove to be fatal. Animals also risk being tangled in the straps of face masks, with seabirds’ feet pictured recently being wrapped in the elastic strings. Drinks litter continues to be found on UK beaches, with an average of 30 drinks containers, caps and lids found per 100 metre of beach surveyed this year. Inland, almost all litter picks (99%) found drinks litter. Dr Laura Foster, head of clean seas at the Marine Conservation Society, said: “This year’s data … shows just how crucial it is that Wales, England and Northern Ireland follow in the footsteps of Scotland and urgently introduce an all-inclusive deposit return scheme. The government has said it will introduce a DRS but only from 2023. “Despite lockdown, with many of us spending more time at home, littering in public spaces has continued unabated. Almost every single local litter pick found at least one drinks container, which is incredibly concerning. An effective deposit return scheme would take the UK one step closer to a circular economy model and drastically reduce the volume of single-use pollution in the UK’s streets, parks and on our beaches.” 1 Plastic and polystyrene pieces (0-50cm) – 167.2 found per 100 metre of beach surveyed2 Plastic and polystyrene caps and lids – 19.73 Wet wipes – 17.74 Cigarette stubs – 16.25 Plastic string – 15.8"
"Householders reduced their food waste by 76% in a recent trial in which they took steps such as making better use of leftovers and using their freezers more. Two-thirds of the participants said they slashed their weekly food bill by an average of £16.50 per week – equivalent to £858 over a year. The findings from the six-week experiment mean that each of the households could stop more than 76kg of food ending up in the bin if they continued their new habits for a year. The trial was organised by Tesco in conjunction with the environmental charity Hubbub. During the challenge, 53 households logged their food waste and followed tips on more effective meal planning, food storage and cooking classes from the supermarket’s chefs. “We know that food waste is a stubborn problem for many households so it’s really promising to see these results” said Aoife Allen, the head of food at Hubbub. “The group embraced meal planning and batch cooking, along with using up leftovers and freezing a wider range of foods. And when we asked one month on whether they were keeping up their habits, 94% said that they were wasting less food than before the pilot, with eating leftovers as the top habit they’d taken forward.” The bigger scheme aims to slash the 6.6m-tonne mountain of food thrown away by UK households every year. On top of its negative environmental impact, food waste typically costs a family of four about £60 a month. The UK has signed up to a global sustainable target of halving food waste by 2030.In other highlights, 90% of households said they had used all the food they bought each week, while 88% had improved their storage techniques to make their food last longer. Supermarkets have been criticised for wasting food in their supply chains that could be diverted to food banks. In 2018 Sainsbury’s abandoned a £10m scheme to halve food waste after a year-long trial in a Derbyshire town produced disappointing results."
"A bird said to have the aerodynamic build of a “jet fighter” has been tracked flying more than 12,000km (7,500 miles) from Alaska to New Zealand, setting a new world record for avian non-stop flight. The bar-tailed godwit set off from south-west Alaska on 16 September and arrived in a bay near Auckland 11 days later, having flown at speeds of up to 55mph. The male bird, known as 4BBRW in reference to the blue, blue, red and white rings fitted on its legs, also had a 5gm satellite tag harnessed on its lower back to allow scientists to track its progress. It was one of four to leave together from the Alaskan mudflats where they had been feeding on clams and worms for two months. The male bar-tailed godwit, whose standard weight is between 190gm and 400gm, can double in size before a long flight but is able to shrink its internal organs to lighten the load. After leaving Alaska, the birds headed south over the Aleutian Islands and on to the Pacific Ocean. The journey is thought to have been prolonged by strong easterly winds, which pushed the group towards Australia. The satellite recorded a point-to-point flight of 12,854km but the scientists believe that once rounding errors are taken into account the journey will have been around 12,200km. It is estimated that the total flight time was 224 hours. The previous longest recorded non-stop flight by a bird, of 11,680km, was recorded in 2007. Dr Jesse Conklin, from the Global Flyway Network, a consortium of scientists studying epic migratory journeys, said: “They seem to have some capability of knowing where they are on the globe. We can’t really explain it but they seem to have an onboard map. “They are flying over open ocean for days and days in the mid-Pacific; there is no land at all. Then they get to New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea where there are quite a few islands and, we might be anthropomorphising, but it really looks like they start spotting land and sort of think: ‘Oh, I need to start veering or I will miss New Zealand’.” It is not certain but it is believed the birds do not sleep on the journey during which they flap their wings most of the time. “They have an incredibly efficient fuel-to-energy rate,” Conklin said. “They have a lot of things going for them. They are designed like a jet fighter. Long, pointed wings and a really sleek design which gives them a lot of aerodynamic potential.” The birds were among 20 caught and tagged by the Pūkorokoro Miranda Shorebird Centre, in the Firth of Thames, south-east of Auckland, in late 2019. They are expected to start the return flight in March, flying across Asia where they will feed for a month around the Yellow Sea, before returning to Alaska. Scientists with the Global Flyway Network believe the route across the Pacific functions as an “ecological corridor” rather than a barrier to the birds; providing a wind-assisted passage relatively free of the risks of disease and predators. “There are other birds that make similar-scale flights of say 10,000km but there are not a whole load of places in the world where it is necessary,” Conklin said. “So it is not necessarily that this is the only bird capable of it – but it is the only bird that needs to do it.”"
"An image of a clearly ecstatic tigress hugging an ancient Manchurian fir tree in a remote Siberian forest has won one of the world’s most prestigious photography prizes. It took Russian photographer Sergey Gorshkov 11 months to capture the moment using hidden cameras. His patience led to him being named 2020 wildlife photographer of the year by the Duchess of Cambridge at a ceremony at London’s Natural History Museum. The image was selected from more than 49,000, with Roz Kidman Cox, the chair of the judging panel, calling the photograph “a unique glimpse of an intimate moment deep in a magical forest”. The animal is an Amur, or Siberian, tiger, which live in the vast woodlands of eastern Russia with a small number over the border in China and possibly North Korea. Hunted to the verge of extinction, the population is still threatened by poaching and logging, which also affects their prey – mostly deer and wild boar. Recent surveys have indicated that greater protection may have resulted in a population of 500 to 600. Kidman Cox said the photograph told this story “in glorious colour and texture of the comeback of the Amur tiger, a symbol of the Russian wilderness”. “It’s a scene like no other,” she said. “Shafts of low winter sun highlight the ancient fir tree and the coat of the huge tigress as she grips the trunk in obvious ecstasy and inhales the scent of tiger on resin, leaving her own mark as her message.” Amur tigers have huge territories of up to 2,000km for males and 450km for females, which makes photographing them incredibly difficult. Gorshkov said he knew his chances were slim but he was determined to capture an image of such a totemic animal. He scoured the forest for signs on trees where messages – scent, hair, urine or scratch marks – appeared to exist. He installed his camera trap opposite this fir tree in January 2019 and struck gold in November. He titled the image The Embrace. Tim Littlewood, the Natural History Museum’s executive director of science and a jury member, said the Amur tiger population was still in a perilous place. But he added: “The remarkable sight of the tigress immersed in her natural environment offers us hope. Through the unique emotive power of photography, we are reminded of the beauty of the natural world and our shared responsibility to protect it.” Now in its 56th year, the prize leads to one of the most popular photography exhibitions in the world. It opens to the public this year, with reduced admission and booking essential, on Friday. The show will include “the fox that got the goose”, taken by Finnish teenager Liina Heikkinen on the island of Lehtisaari, Helsinki. As the title suggests, it shows a fox cub grimly hanging on to a barnacle goose it has caught, refusing to share it with siblings. The image wins the young wildlife photographer 2020 title. Other images going on display include a stonechat perched on a flower stem; a clownfish with a tongue-eating louse doing just that; a chilled proboscis monkey posing at a sanctuary in Sabah, Borneo; a Manduriacu spider glass frog snacking on a spider; the good parenting skills of great crested grebes; a sand wasp and a cuckoo wasp both about to enter their neighbouring nest holes; and a rare picture of a family of Pallas’s cats in north-west China."
"More Australians have been killed in unprovoked shark attacks this year than in any year since 1934. But the total number of shark bites is in line with the annual average over the past decade. It is prompting experts to consider whether the La Niña weather event, associated with cooler sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific, may be affecting where sharks search for prey. On Sunday, police in Western Australia called off their search for the body of Andrew Sharpe after pieces of the 52-year-old father’s wetsuit and surfboard had washed up on the beach near Esperance. Friends saw a shark bite him two days earlier. His death was the seventh from a shark bite in Australia in 2020 and the sixth from an unprovoked attack. According to the Australian Shark Attack File, it has been 86 years since six people last died from unprovoked shark bites in a single year. In 1929, nine people died from unprovoked shark bites in Australia – a record that preceded debate about introducing the first shark nets at Australian beaches several years later. Dr Phoebe Meagher, the wildlife conservation officer with the Taronga Conservation Society Australia who manages the Australian Shark Attack File, said the six deaths from unprovoked bites this year was well above Australia’s 50-year average of 1.02 deaths a year, but the general shark bite numbers were looking “smack bang on average”. There have been 17 unprovoked shark bites so far in 2020, the same as last year and one fewer than in 2018. In 2015, there were 22. Dr Blake Chapman, a marine biologist who examined shark neuroscience for her PhD, told Guardian Australia that understanding how a shark behaved when attacking was important in determining its intent. She said repeated bites suggested the shark was treating a human as prey. “In some of the cases this year it sounds like the shark hung around and bit more than once, which is unusual behaviour for great white sharks,” she said. “When they bite more than once it’s more likely to be fatal as there’s more blood loss.” However, she noted some fatal attacks had been single bites on the upper part of the leg, groin or near the abdomen, leading to greater blood loss from key arteries and vital organs. She said great white sharks, which have killed several of this year’s victims, “tend to follow migrations of prey”, such as salmon, which can be influenced by a La Niña event. “We do tend to see little spikes in shark bites in La Niña ,” she said. “For great white sharks, if we see them bite someone once and then leave, it suggests they were maybe curious and weren’t in the area for prey, because there is nothing stopping a shark from eating a person.” Chapman said different Australian jurisdictions investigated and recorded varying levels of detail about an attack. Combined with the relatively small number of deaths, it made it hard to definitively understand the causes behind the increased death toll this year. Prof Robert Harcourt, the director of Macquarie University’s marine mammal research group and a researcher of shark behaviour, said that in addition to cooler water temperatures being favourable to great white sharks, increased rains during a La Niña could reduce salinity and attract bull sharks to waters where more people swim. He said currents and winds could also lead to salmon and other fish clustering closer to the shore than under other conditions. “The sharks are responding to where their prey will most likely be,” Harcourt said. In January, a 57-year-old experienced diver, Gary Johnson, was killed by a shark near Esperance in Western Australia, and in April, a 23-year-old wildlife ranger, Zachary Robba, was killed by a shark off the Great Barrier Reef. In June, Rob Pedretti, 60, died after he was bitten by a shark while surfing in northern NSW, and in July, a teenager died from a shark bite while surfing at another beach in the region. In September, 46-year-old Nick Slater died after being bitten while surfing near the Gold Coast. While surfing is not considered provoking a shark, the death of a 36-year-old while spearfishing off Queensland’s Fraser Island in July is considered to be the result of a provoked bite, as the release of fish blood attracts sharks."
"The RSPB is demanding new regulations and better enforcement of existing laws to control the shooting of game birds in the UK. The charity made the call yesterday at its AGM after publishing a review that found self-regulation by the shooting community had failed to address the environmental impacts of the game bird industry. Illegal killing of birds of prey, the use of poisonous lead ammunition, the burning of vegetation on peatlands and the release of 57 million game birds - mainly non-native pheasants and red-legged partridges - into the countryside each year are now causing unacceptable damage, the organisation claims. “The RSPB has recognised for many years that some types of game bird shooting can deliver benefits for nature, but the most intensive forms are damaging our environment,” said director of conservation Martin Harper. “We are facing a climate and ecological emergency, and it’s down to all of us, from individuals to big business, to play our part in helping to revive our countryside.” Harper said the most effective measure would be a system of licensing which would set minimum environmental standards for shoots. “Failure to comply with the rules would result in losing the right to shoot. However, change must come soon: if effective reform isn’t achieved within five years our trustees are clear that we will pursue a ban.” The call was rejected by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, which said the RSPB risked creating a divide between itself and rural Britain. “No one in shooting wants to see environmentally damaging practices,” said chief executive Ian Bell. “The RSPB needs to acknowledge that, rather than damaging its relationship with a key conservation community.” "
"For a couple of days each year, the textures of change in this little nook of Rutland are palpable. The greens of summer are still the foundations, in the grass, in the moss and in the reeds of the little stream. But here as well are the signals of autumn. The tree line has lost its anonymity; instead, a scattergun of pomp picks out the exhibitionists: acid green, red and burnt gold adding briefly brilliant flamboyance. Lone trees, old oaks mainly, are thinning, revealing the bones beneath. Trees always look older in the first weeks of autumn; the light sits lower, making hard shadows across the lines and gouges, lighting the relief with a crisp warmth at odds with the sudden bite in the air. Fungi are everywhere. I bend to examine a stand of mushrooms, noticing they all have inky darkenings spread to the same angle of their caps, to the east. Probably coincidence, but anything clock-like feeds a preoccupation with time at this hour of the year. When daylight isn’t so rationed, it’s surreal here most summers. An open-air theatre in the grounds of nearby Tolethorpe Hall sends quotes of Shakespeare into the warm air, all that passion and romance and murder and savagery drifting over this bucolic stage. There has been none this summer, of course. And now here is autumn, arriving unaltered, ushering in the darker months with its own brilliant production, both visual and audible. The noise is spine-tingling, and for some reason always chimes with dusk at this time of year. It’s felt in shiver-air, seen in silhouette, and often heard when wood smoke is smelled. Crows, in number, fill the air with their jeers. It’s a sound that burrows to the core and down the spine. And because the leaves are falling, you see the crows too: like odd punctuation on the branch lines of the trees. They call these little-understood corvid socials “staging”. Everyone knows the collective noun is a murder. Nobody really knows why, but most of the theories are dark. And however ominous, they are not welcome thoughts on a fine afternoon like this. Walking back into the village under the wing of dusk, the stage is theirs."
"Bottle-fed babies are swallowing millions of microplastic particles a day, according to research described as a “milestone” in the understanding of human exposure to tiny plastics. Scientists found that the recommended high-temperature process for sterilising plastic bottles and preparing formula milk caused bottles to shed millions of microplastics and trillions of even smaller nanoplastics. The polypropylene bottles tested make up 82% of the world market, with glass bottles being the main alternative. Polypropylene is one of the most commonly used plastics and preliminary tests by the scientists found kettles and food containers also produced millions of microplastics per litre of liquid. Microplastics in the environment were already known to contaminate human food and drink, but the study shows that food preparation in plastic containers can lead to exposure thousands of times higher. The health impacts are unknown and the scientists say there is an “urgent need” to assess the issue, particularly for infants. The team has also produced sterilisation guidelines to reduce microplastic exposure. Prof John Boland, at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, said “we were absolutely gobsmacked” at the number of microplastics produced by the baby bottles. “A study last year by the World Health Organization estimated adults would consume between 300 and 600 microplastics a day – our average values were on the order of a million or millions.” He added: “We have to start doing the health studies to understand the implications. We’re already working with colleagues to look at what buttons in the immune system these particles begin to press.” He said many of the particles would simply be excreted but further investigation was needed into how many could be absorbed into the bloodstream and travel to other parts of the body. “I’ve already gotten rid of all those [food] containers I used to use and if I had young children I would modify how I prepare [milk formula],” Boland said. “The message is the precautionary principle.” Philipp Schwabl, at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria and not part of the research team, said: “These findings represent an important milestone. The scale of microplastic exposure presented here may seem alarming, but the real-world effects on infant health require further investigation.” Prof Oliver Jones, at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, noted the babies’ exposure levels were estimates, not measurements: “We should not be making parents feel bad for using plastic bottles. However, this study illustrates that the microplastics problem is likely much bigger than we think [and] something we need to start really getting to grips with.” People were already known to consume microplastics via food and water, and to breathe them in. In particular, tea brewed using plastic-based teabags and drinking water sold in plastic bottles have been found to contain microplastics. Scientists are concerned that microplastics may carry pathogens or toxic chemicals into the body. Microplastics from plastic waste have polluted the entire planet, from Arctic snow and Alpine soils to the deepest oceans. But Prof Liwen Xiao at Trinity College said: “Our study indicates that plastic products are an important source of microplastics, meaning the routes of exposure are much closer to us than previously thought.” The research, published in the journal Nature Food, began with an accidental finding when one researcher who was developing filters found they kept getting clogged with microplastics. These were subsequently traced back to polypropylene lab equipment. The team followed international sterilisation guidelines to make baby formula in 10 different feeding bottles. This involves sterilising with 95C (203F) water, then shaking the formula powder with 70C water in the bottle. Both the hot water and shaking steps produced a lot of microplastics, which are far smaller than the width of a human hair. Nanoplastics are so small they are very hard to count, but the scientists estimated trillions were produced per litre of fluid. The scientists combined their experimental data with rates of bottle-feeding and milk intake in 48 regions, covering three-quarters of the global population. On average, they estimated that babies are exposed to 1.6m microplastic particles a day during their first year when fed using plastic bottles. The US, Australia and European countries had the highest levels – more than 2m particles per day, due to higher levels of bottle feeding. The scientists suggest an additional washing step can cut the microplastics produced during usual formula preparation. Water boiled in a non-plastic container and then cooled is used to rinse the bottle three times after sterilisation. The formula is also made in a non-plastic container, then cooled and poured into the clean bottle. “That will dramatically reduce the number of microplastics,” said Boland. “The last thing we want is to unduly alarm parents, particularly when we don’t have sufficient information on the potential [health] consequences. However, we are calling on policymakers to reassess the current guidelines for formula preparation when using plastic infant feeding bottles.” Other solutions include using glass bottles, though these are heavier for babies to hold and are breakable, and developing tough new coatings to prevent plastics shedding particles. Boland said plastics were “wonderful” materials with many useful applications: “So the reality is they’re here to stay and we will have to make them safer and more resilient.”"
"Farmers facing one of their toughest years in recent memory have received little comfort this week from a usually reliable ally: the Conservative party. Their pleas to the government to enshrine in law a commitment to the UK’s high standards of food safety and animal welfare were ignored. In a long and impassioned debate in the House of Commons on Monday, amendments to the agriculture bill that had almost universal backing from farming leaders were defeated, steamrollered under the government’s 80-strong majority. The stakes could scarcely be higher: British farmers are worried that post-Brexit trade bills with the US and other countries will allow the import of food and agricultural products that are currently banned under EU regulations. Produced to a lower standard than the UK mandates, these foods would undercut British produce – yet if the UK were to lower its own standards, the export route for British food to its biggest market, Europe, would be blocked. They have been arguing, alongside food and environmental campaigners, for legal status to be given to UK standards, which would prevent any future deals that undercut them. The threat that the government will be bombarded with demands by other countries to allow the import of lower standard food is real: Greenpeace uncovered documents earlier this week showing the Food Standards Agency was readying itself for a flood of applications. In the absence of legal status for UK standards, those applications will be decided behind closed doors. “We have seen absolute fury over [the agriculture bill],” said Vicki Hird, head of farming policy at the NGO coalition Sustain. “People are telling us it makes them sick to their stomach to find out what is being done by the government. There will be unbridled fury if this continues.” Polls have consistently found broad support for upholding UK food and animal welfare standards. A recent YouGov survey found nine out of 10 people thought British standards should be protected in future trade deals, and more than a million signed an NFU petition on the issue. A spokesperson for the government said: “This government has been clear it will not sign a trade deal that will compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards, and claims to the contrary are unhelpful scaremongering.  “We are a world leader in these areas, and that will not change. Chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef are not permitted for import into the UK. This will be retained through the EU Withdrawal Act and enshrined in UK law at the end of the transition period.” Ministers have made repeated assurances about chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef, but these are only two products. “There is much more behind this: focusing on these iconic issues is hiding the many other ways in which standards can be lowered,” said Hird. For ministers, the refusal to legislate on UK farming and food standards is consistent with a position on Brexit that wants to leave as much leeway for negotiators of trade bills as possible. The same was on show in the fisheries bill, debated on Tuesday night in the Commons. Amendments there would have required the government to make good on its promises to limit fishing catches in line with scientific advice, and stop supertrawlers from fishing in marine protected areas, but both were defeated by large government majorities. But while the government is showing consistency in its Brexit and environmental policies, ministers risk alienating some of their staunchest supporters. Rural constituencies across England are overwhelmingly Tory-held, and some feel that ministers are taking this traditional backing for granted. There are signs, from MPs’ bulging post sacks to irate tweets, that normally loyal backers are growing impatient. Farmers have already had the worst wheat harvest in 30 years, poor harvests for other staples such as potatoes, the supply chain disruption of lockdown, when many lost their prime markets, and they are now facing the potential disaster of a no-deal Brexit. Any retreat from UK standards in future trade deals would leave small farmers across the country facing ruin. Mark Bridgeman, president of the CLA, which represents 30,000 landowners and rural businesses, warned: “Farmers across the country will be watching the government’s every move very closely from here on in.” Boris Johnson moved personally to soothe this key constituency by holding a private meeting at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday with Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union. Batters said: “We are at a juncture that will have ramifications for both farming and the wider public for decades to come. I made clear that the nation cares deeply about British food and the high standards it is produced to. They do not want to see it undermined by imported food that could be produced to standards that are illegal here.” Labour senses amid the outcry a rare opportunity to force rural, predominantly pro-Brexit voters to question whether the Tory government is acting in their interests. The party knows that “there is no route [to electoral victory] that does not go through rural areas”, said Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, pointing out that Labour won 170 rural constituencies in 1997 but held only 17 of them in 2019. “There’s a high level of unease among the public – you can sense people are worried,” he said. “It’s time for the Tories to look closely at what they’re working for and what they risk destroying.” The agriculture bill will return to the Commons in a few weeks, with an amendment to strengthen the trade and agriculture commission, which the government has pledged can scrutinise trade agreements to ensure they are in line with UK standards. There may be some compromise on that, but it will fall short of the full legal status for UK farming and environmental standards that campaigners demanded. But the real test of whether ministers are prepared to uphold farming and environmental standards will come when trade deals are to be signed, according to Shaun Spiers, executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. “I suspect the government is very conflicted on this,” he said. “I don’t think the government is trying to weaken standards, but it is sensible to be worried about it, because they will be under huge pressure, especially if we turn our back on the EU.” When those tests come, ministers should be aware that these are deeply and widely held concerns, and voters have shown willingness in recent years to change their party allegiances. Green campaigners point to the high public awareness of their battles to show that food and the environment cannot be dismissed as fringe issues. Spiers warned: “No government can afford to take on Middle England.”"
"The amount of household recycling collected has nearly doubled in some areas during the pandemic, pushing up the costs of keeping services running, local councils have said. Eight in 10 English councils reported a rise in the volume of paper, cardboard, plastic and glass being collected since the national lockdown began, according to data from the Local Government Association (LGA). Half of councils said they were collecting up to 20% more material for recycling than normal, with a third dealing with 50% more and some noting a 100% rise – on a par with levels usually experienced at Christmas. The surge in the amount of household waste and recycling to collect has increased costs to councils, alongside extra cleaning of vehicles, staff shortages due to Covid-19, and disruption caused by more cars parked on roads. The LGA warns that councils face a funding gap of more than £5bn by 2024 to maintain services at current levels – a figure that could double amid the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “Councils have kept waste and recycling services running during the Covid-19 outbreak, working hard to keep staff safe and deal with high volumes of household waste normally only seen at Christmas,” said Cllr David Renard, LGA environment spokesman. “This has led to additional cost pressures, which must be met in full for councils to be able to maintain services and cope with the increase.” Among those buckling under the pressure are Gateshead council, which saw the total tonnage of recycling collected between April and July this year increase by 23% compared with last year, with more cardboard being recycled than ever before – up 250%. In Devon, recycling rates rose 12% between April and June of this year, with 1,000 tonnes more glass bottles and jars and 1,300 tonnes more card collected than during the same period in 2019. This is despite Devon already having one of the highest recycling rates in the country, at 56%."
"An estimated 5,000 Cape fur seal foetuses have been found along the shores of Namibia, a large portion of the expected new pup arrivals. The bodies were spotted by Naude Dreyer of Ocean Conservation Namibia (OCN), who flew his drone over Walvis Bay’s Pelican Point seal colony on 5 October and counted hundreds of bodies. “This is tragic, as it makes up a large portion of the new pup arrivals expected in late November,” he tweeted. Cape fur seals are mostly found along the coasts of Namibia and South Africa, with females giving birth in November and December. When there is a shortage of food, they will often abandon their young or abort their foetuses. Dr Tess Gridley, of the Namibian dolphin project and Stellenbosch University in South Africa, who is part of the research team monitoring the situation, said dead pups are commonly found at this time of year – but not on this scale. Dreyer started noticing bodies in August, but became concerned when he found hundreds on one day in October. An estimated 150 pre-term pups have also been found in the Cape Cross colony, further north. Total deaths are estimated at 5,000, although Gridley says it is difficult to be certain as many carcasses are eaten by scavengers, such as black-backed jackals. She says: “We are concerned about emaciated juveniles and adult females as well, which have also been observed at Pelican Point and to the north – indicating a wider scale to this event. “This event could disrupt the normal breeding cycle at the affected colonies. Normally females will give birth to a pup each year, and they come into oestrus shortly afterwards and mate with the bulls. With females aborting pregnancies, they may come into oestrus earlier, but the males may not have organised themselves for mating. Also, the females are very thin and may not be healthy enough to reproduce.” Lack of food, disease and toxins are all possible causes, but there is not enough data yet to confirm the reason, Gridley says.  There was a similar large-scale die-off in 1994, where a combination of malnutrition and a secondary bacterial infection, Streptococcus phocae, were identified as causes. Dr Brett Gardner, a vet, says: “In addition to females being thin and possible having a decreased likelihood of falling pregnant in the coming breeding season, there will be a significant lack of recruitment of new young individuals into the population in the next few years once the foetuses that were now lost are supposed to be maturing into reproductive adults. “Without knowing the extent of this or what is causing it means we do not know what risk it carries for repeat events of catastrophic die-offs in the future.” The scientists are gathering data for analysis, using drones to count the bodies and collecting biological samples to establish causes. They have told authorities monitoring other Cape fur seal colonies to remain vigilant."
"The sun, a huge rose floating in the mist, opens as wood pigeon flocks return to fields, leaving trees smouldering with October fire. The trees on Wenlock Edge that really burn with autumnal reds and golds are on the rose spectrum: wild cherry and wild service. Both Prunus avium – gean, mazzard or wild cherry – and Sorbus torminalis – checker, chequers or wild service – belong to the family of the rose, a fifth column of plants with a sensuality that ignites human and avian desire. There is a stretch of woodland that runs along the top of a small ravine where a stream rushing from five springs cuts down the Edge into a little alder swamp before heading into Harley Brook and from there into the River Severn. Above the steep bank – still but for stream song, the pa-tunk of acorns dropping from oaks, a distant aeroplane, the inaudible melting of magpie inkcap fungi and the shift of leaves – a stand of tall cherries and services catch the afternoon light. Against a blue sky with drifting greys, the upper cherry leaves at 40 feet have almost gone; those that remain look yellow from underneath but scarlet from above. The wild service trees, with maple-like leaves, are a dense buttery gold, a dazzling understorey up to 25 feet tall spreading beneath; they may go a deep orange before they fall. The local and Scandi blackbirds have been through the bright but bitter cherries and the rough khaki berries of service; they ripened in September and have all been snaffled up. Although both species are native to Wenlock Edge, this patch of woodland has an extraordinary density of them. The grey, banded candlestick trunks of cherry are tall and elegant; perhaps they were planted or managed to produce long straight timber for musical instruments or furniture. The dark, scraggily irregular architecture of services may have been encouraged for producing berries used in brewing and medicine effective against colic. Deliberate cultivation or random populations relict of ancient forests, this jumble of trees with its double flash of spring blossom and autumn colour is what marks the seasons, something now of inestimable value, a secret that passes from the miracle of the rose."
"It sounds like something out of The Day of the Triffids: a stinging nettle the size of a large tree, with a sting so vicious it inflicts excruciating pain that can last for days, weeks or even months. But this is no science fiction, these are the stinging trees of Australia.Dendrocnide excelsa can grow up to 35 metres tall in tropical rainforests in Queensland, one of a gang of six Dendrocnide tree or shrub species found in Australia. These thugs of the plant world belong to the same family as common stinging nettles, with leaves covered in similar tiny needle-like hairs that act like hypodermic syringes, injecting their poison at the slightest touch of the skin, although the poison is far more powerful than a nettle’s. The poison in stinging trees was recently discovered to be a peptide not previously seen in plants, and remarkably similar to that in some venomous spiders and cone snails found in tropical seas, which also inflict terrible pain. The poison works by binding to pain receptors in the nervous system, firing them up into a frenzy of activity, and it’s hoped that working out exactly how these proteins work may lead to the creation of new painkillers."
"Exactly two weeks ago, the kids arrived. All three. Since then the Collins Street falcons, who live in a small nook above the now-empty CBD, have become Melbourne’s favourite family. Thousands of people tune in every day to a 24-hour webcam stream of the nest, located on the side of a skyscraper, hosted on YouTube and the building’s own special website. For residents of the locked-down city, the feathered friends have become a symbol of freedom and a source of joy. Like restricted Melburnians, the falcons only seem to leave home for the essential reasons of work or obtaining food (in their case, live pigeons, rats and sometimes fish). The birds already had a cult following prior to lockdown – having nested in Collins Street for years – but their popularity has grown exponentially since their young popped out of their shells on 2 October. Dr Victor Hurley from BirdLife Australia said that a Facebook group dedicated to the falcons now has 11,600 members – up from “five or six hundred” last year. “A lot of people in lockdown in Melbourne have been fascinated by this experience,” he told Guardian Australia. “That is understandable and delightful.” Highlights among the avid avian-watchers include the day the eggs were laid, the day they hatched, their first meal and when one of the chicks briefly hopped out of the nest. “There is a certain level of, how to put it politely, obsession, bordering on obsession with minutiae,” Hurley told Guardian Australia. “I tend to be a bit more relaxed about it. “Someone suggested we should put a fence on the ledge to prevent them falling off. They nest on ledges on cliff tops [and] are the most widely distributed terrestrial vertebrates on the planet after humans. They are the product of 3m years of evolution, they have probably figured out how to do this.” A post from Friday with nearly 500 likes celebrated the eyases two-week birthday, complete with photoshopped party hats and balloons. Other users have nicknamed the three Larry, Curly and Moe or Huey, Dewey and Louie. Hurley said school teachers had told him their classes were watching the falcons, which he hopes becomes a good lesson in the importance of maintaining green spaces in the city. “It’s a good educative thing. If people can’t get out in nature, there is nothing wrong with bringing nature to their classrooms via the internet. “The green space in Melbourne is what generates the prey and what allows the predator to live. The link is really strong, it’s a really positive lesson about keeping that green space. “Everyone is thrilled about the idea of a predator living in Collins Street other than corporate bankers,” he said. “A different kind of predator. A natural-born one.” All three eggs were laid six days apart, but hatched within three hours of each other, which is a common way of synchronising hatching. “The mother delayed incubation until about a day after the last egg was laid,” Hurley said. “That delay allows them to cool down, and once she reheats them to body temperature, that sets off the biochemical reactions that lead to the development of a chick. “That allows the egg to hatch in a synchronised fashion, which means they don’t get a large age discrepancy. Though falcons are very egalitarian and don’t tend to have siblicide, the oldest one does usually waddle first and eat first.” The falcons usually breed every spring, but in past years, tragedy has struck. In 2019, one of the chicks died, on camera, and its body was left on the livestream for days. But Hurley said this year would be cheerier. He said last year’s deaths were the result of severe drought conditions, which have since lifted. “It often occurs in drought years ... because the prey is that much more stressed. When they get more stressed their parasite loads increase and the young become infected and it takes them out.” This year, he is confident the young will be ready to fly in a month, leaving their mother’s nest and venturing out into the world on their own.. “They will be flying in mid-November,” he said. “I’m anticipating a successful spring for them.” And once the kids are off, the parents will return to their lives, and mostly likely breed again next year. “They tend to mate for life,” Hurley said. “But there is a really, really quick turnover rate if one of the pair dies. They usually get replaced within days. So they mate for life until you are dead.”"
"Microplastics can alter the behaviour of fish, with those that ingest the pollutants likely to be bolder, more active and swim in risky areas where they die en masse, according to a new study. The survival risk posed by microplastics is also exacerbated by degrading coral reefs, as dying corals make particularly younger fish more desperate to find nutrition and shelter, and to venture into waters where they are more likely to be taken by predators themselves. In a joint study conducted by Australia’s James Cook University as well as other institutions including the University of Cambridge, marine ecologists pulse fed groups of juvenile ambon damselfish, housed across several tanks, a diet of brine shrimp. In addition to the shrimp, researchers also added fine microplastics, including polystyrene spherical beads about 200 microns (0.2mm) thick, into some of the tanks, in an effort to simulate the dietary choices fishes encounter in the environment. Researchers found the microplastics were mostly eaten. After four days of feeding the tanks of fish differently, the researchers tagged the fish and released them back into the waters they were originally taken from – on the northern part of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Fish were then placed by divers in different areas, into live healthy corals as well as areas of degraded corals. The study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal, found that the groups of fish that had eaten microplastics exhibited the more active, bold and risky behaviour. All the fish that ate microplastics that were placed in areas of degraded corals were eaten by predators within 72 hours of being released by researchers. Prof Mark McCormick, who led the study, told the Guardian the behavioural change, and subsequent impact on their chance of survival, was triggered because when fish ingest microplastics, they become full but haven’t received the nutrition they require. “Their gut is saying ‘you’re full’, but their brain is saying ‘you need nutrition’. “Like humans, when we’re very hungry, we might run across the road … as opposed to walking across safely. And for the fish who are hungry, they are more willing to take risks, and this means straying further from shelter for food, where they are eaten by predators.” McCormick said most of the microplastic waste in Australian waters came from fast food associated containers and paraphernalia, including bottles, which got flushed into the sea and broken down by agitation and weather events into “millions of pieces”. Understanding of plastic pollution in marine life, he explained, “often tends toward popular photos of turtles with straws in their noses, birds full of plastic, and fish stuck in a six-pack ring, when the animal thinks it’s food and ends up starving to death”. “There’s very little information when you look at when the fish can eat the plastic, as is the case with microplastics, and look at it pass through their guts and when it’s digested.” McCormick said the study looked at juvenile fish because they’re vulnerable to larger fish and are at a stage of life “where they’ve got to learn who is a predator and who is not very quickly”. “Anything that influences their mortality at their baby stage has quite major influences on how many fishes survive and how many can reproduce,” McCormick said. Predators that ate fish that had ingested microplastics accumulated the material, he added, which had ramifications for fish populations throughout the food chain. Louise Tosetto, a marine ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, said a false sense of satiation could change a fish’s personality, and said that, while the JCU study did not examine this, some microplastics could also containchemicals that could affect behaviour. Tosetto said previous studies had shown chemicals from pharmaceuticals and hormones that entered waterways could change fish personality."
"In 1950s London, the impacts of air pollution were obvious in the choking fogs that shrouded the capital, reducing visibility to a few yards and breath to a laboured gasp. Eventually, the great smog of 1952, which may have killed as many as 10,000 people, and sickened an estimated 100,000, prompted action on the smoke from domestic chimneys and industry that was largely to blame. Under the Clean Air Act of 1956, coal-burning was restricted, the smogs cleared, and England could breathe again. Unknown to most people, however, the supposedly clean air was gradually being filled with a new menace: microscopic lung-shredding particles and irritant gases such as nitrogen oxides and ozone, being spewed out in increasing volume by cars and other road vehicles, or created by the action of sunlight on air. These newer invisible forms of air pollution would eventually prove just as deadly: an estimated 40,000 people die each year in the UK from air pollution today, and globally, more than 95% of people breathe air polluted above safe levels. Martin Williams, who has died aged 72 of the heart condition hemopericardium, was one of the first British scientists to delve into this second wave of air pollution, and in a career that spanned academia and government, played an important role in trying to reduce it. He was early to identify ground-level intrusions of ozone, now recognised as a major form of air pollution, and published one of the first papers on air pollution and health, after most people viewed the smogs of the 1950s as a problem that had been solved. Born in Wales, in the industrial town of Mountain Ash, in what was then Mid Glamorgan, to Muriel (nee Tinkler) and Chester Williams, he was brought up in Abercynon and had an early connection with coal, as his father served as a clerk to the National Coal Board. After Mountain Ash grammar school, he went on to take a first class degree in chemistry at University College, Cardiff, in 1968, moving across the Severn to Bristol for his PhD. He had research fellowships at the universities of British Columbia and Bradford before joining the Warren Spring Laboratory, then one of the world’s leading air quality research institutes, in 1975. WSL was established in Stevenage in 1958, under the then Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. It took on a range of work, from attempts to synthesise oil from carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and the extraction of metals from waste, to research into atmospheric pollution, until it was merged with AEA Technology in 1994 and privatised. The sequence of spectacular summers in the UK leading up to the record-breaking 1976 led to the highest levels of photochemical pollution ever recorded up to that time. Knowledge of the impact of such secondary pollution – which occurs when sunlight reacts with basic pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, produced by diesel cars – was then scant. Williams co-authored a key paper in the journal Nature on ground-level ozone concentrations in south-east England in the summer of 1976, showing for the first time the harm this neglected danger posed to health. Realising that the key measurements were from the real-world emissions of cars and lorries, rather than the engines’ performance in carefully controlled environments, Williams then led a team devising tests that would mimic authentic driving conditions. This pioneering work came decades before the Dieselgate scandal that engulfed the motor industry in 2015, when car engines were found to have been fitted with software to cheat in test conditions. Moving in 1993 to the Department of Environment, later reorganised into the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, where he became head of the air pollution programme in 2005, Williams worked at the interface of science and public policy. His role was to translate scientific research into the formulation of policy, advising ministers and leading the negotiations for the UK on air pollution directives in the EU. He also had a strong international focus, and was invited to join the World Health Organisation working group that formulated air quality guidelines to protect public health. For the EU’s directives on air quality - which until Brexit also applied to the UK, though successive governments flouted them - Williams co-chaired the working group on particulate pollution. He was also elected chairman of the scientific arm of the UN Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. In 2010, Williams moved out of government and back to a university career, as professor at the environmental research group at King’s College London. He modelled air quality impacts on health and social deprivation, and last year was named one of the UK’s three clean air champions, with a remit to bring together the UK’s air quality research base to develop practical solutions. Though he worked in England most of his life, Williams never lost his passion for Wales, and was always ready to spark up a conversation about Welsh rugby or Cardiff’s football team. A keen cyclist, he would frequently cycle the 30 miles from home to his work in London, and back at the end of the day. He applied this passion to Wales too: he liked to point out that he had ridden the same Cardiff hills where Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas trained. At scientific conferences, Williams could just as easily be prevailed on to entertain with his ukulele as to scribble out impeccable calculations on the dispersion of Gaussian plumes on the back of an envelope.  Williams’ career exemplified the contribution of a generation of government-employed scientists, who worked at the nexus of cutting-edge research and developing policy, with public health at the core. Much more basic scientific research was carried out by government at the start of his career than by the end, by which time the relationship between universities and governments had become thornier, and the position of scientific advisors to ministers even more fraught. But as the current pandemic crisis shows, the public good will always rely on the skills of scientists who are willing to take on the tricky and often unrewarding role of advising ministers. In 1983 he married Rosemary Hudleston, a scientific civil servant. She survives him, along with their two sons, Tom and Anthony."
"A man is in a critical condition after being attacked by a shark at the Great Barrier Reef. He was airlifted to Townsville University hospital after being bitten at Britomart Reef around 12.20pm on Sunday, Queensland Ambulance says. The area, off the north Queensland coast about 150km north of Townsville, is a popular spear-fishing location. Seven Australians have died from shark bites in 2020 including six in unprovoked attacks – more than any year since 1934. While the total number of shark bites is in line with the annual average over the past decade, it has prompted experts to consider whether the La Niña weather event, associated with cooler sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific, may be affecting where sharks search for prey. According to the Australian Shark Attack File, it has been 86 years since six people last died from unprovoked shark bites in a single year. In 1929, nine people died from unprovoked shark bites in Australia – a record that preceded debate about introducing the first shark nets at Australian beaches several years later. There have been 18 unprovoked shark bites so far in 2020, one more than last year and the same as in 2018. In 2015, there were 22. In January, a 57-year-old experienced diver, Gary Johnson, was killed by a shark near Esperance in Western Australia, and in April, a 23-year-old wildlife ranger, Zachary Robba, was killed by a shark off the Great Barrier Reef. In June, Rob Pedretti, 60, died after he was bitten by a shark while surfing in northern New South Wales, and in July, a teenager died from a shark bite while surfing at another beach in the region. In September, 46-year-old Nick Slater died after being bitten while surfing near the Gold Coast. Authorities called off a search for the body of Andrew Sharpe earlier in October after friends saw the 52-year-old attacked while surfing near Esperance. While surfing is not considered provoking a shark, the death of a 36-year-old while spearfishing off Queensland’s Fraser Island in July is considered to be the result of a provoked bite, as the release of fish blood can attract sharks."
"We walked this stony track to the moors in late summer. Then the banksides were full of upland flowers: St John’s Wort, devil’s-bit scabious, bell heather and sneezewort – small dabs of colour among grass and ferns. Now the eye is saturated by tall swathes of red and orange, the brief autumn flare of rosebay willowherb. Its leaves are a graduation of colours that bleed into each other like pigments leaching from a watercolourist’s brush. Its tops are silver with unfurling seeds. Within a week, these leaves will turn to burgundy as they twist in on themselves before shrivelling to a dull brown. Rosebay willowherb is a pioneer plant, spreading by windblown seed – 80,000 from just one plant – or by rhizomes marching through the soil. It’s a coloniser on the margins of landscapes, of road verges, woodland edges and wasteland. The downy seeds are carried along railway lines by the draught of trains, along with buddleia, Michaelmas daisy and Oxford ragwort. A coloniser of scorched earth, it was chosen as the county flower of London for its regenerative symbolism after the blitz. I take home a piece to draw, my pen scrolling across the page, enjoying the curling lines where each seedpod splits into four. Studying these rhythmic shapes makes me appreciate their exuberance. I grow rosebay willowherb in my garden, but in a white form, Chamaenerion angustifolium ‘Album’, instead of the usual pink, its tapering spires graceful against the shadowy trees. A source of nectar and pollen for bees, it’s the food plant for several species of moths, including the small phoenix, the bright-line brown-eye and various hawk moths. Luckily, I have enough garden space to let loose this vigorous plant. I’m rewarded by elephant hawk moths, Deilephila elpenor, dramatically striped in candy pink and olive green. It’s their plump and wrinkled caterpillars that suggest elephants’ trunks. They also have four striking eye spots and a black “horn” towards the rear. When threatened, a caterpillar retracts its snout, swelling its body and enlarging its eye markings for protection. Elephant hawk moths pupate in cocoons in leaf litter. I chop up the stems of my willowherb as a garden mulch, a quiet place for the pupae to overwinter before emerging next year as glamorous pink and green moths."
"Tens of thousands of hectares of bush could be at risk under a New South Wales government proposal to allow rural landholders to clear up to 25 metres of land from their property’s fence line, analysis by WWF-Australia shows. The NSW government announced this month it planned to amend its Rural Fires Act to allow clearing without an approval on rural property boundaries to reduce bushfire risk. The proposal, which was not one of the 76 recommendations from the NSW bushfire inquiry, prompted alarm it could lead to broad-scale clearing of endangered forest and habitat and was called “anti-science” by the independent MLC Justin Field. WWF-Australia used spatial data to examine how much forest could be exposed under the proposed changes in four local government areas: Clarence Valley, Port Stephens, Shoalhaven and Wollondilly. It found if all rural property holders cleared to the maximum extent, 44,293ha of forest could be at risk in those four council areas, 32,609ha of that in Clarence Valley. The analysis found 12,000ha of at-risk forest in those regions was high quality koala habitat unless the state government imposed conditions to protect it. Martin Taylor, a conservation scientist at WWF-Australia, said there would be landholders who would not clear their land if the proposal passed the state parliament. “But this is what is at risk of being cleared if they go ahead and do it,” he said. “It’s gratuitous. You’re fragmenting forests even more than they are already. Particularly for koalas, it makes it harder for them to get around.” NSW laws already allow property owners to clear trees within 10 metres of a house or other building, and shrubs within 50 metres, to mitigate bushfire risk. The proposed rules would allow an additional 25 metres of clearing at the boundary. Property owners are also permitted to clear distances of 15 metres in coastal NSW, 30 metres in central NSW and 40 metres in western NSW to construct or maintain rural infrastructure, such as a fence. The greatest impact of the proposed changes is expected to be in coastal zones that have been most exposed to bushfires. Field expressed concern the government still had not presented any advice it had received from the NSW RFS before announcing the proposed amendments earlier this month. He said the emergency services minister, David Elliott, “has not been willing to explain” how the proposal would reduce bushfire risk, nor why it had been prioritised over the 76 recommendations from the bushfire inquiry report. “My concern is it will be developers that use this,” Field said. “I also worry that it sends the message that this is a constructive way to manage bushfire risk. It sets us up for failure.” The government is likely to introduce the legislation to parliament in November. It has said it would develop a code to take account of endangered species and habitat but it is unclear what this would entail and whether it would be introduced at the same time. Elliott did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia. Field said the government needed to ensure protections were in place for riparian zones, such as creek lines, critically endangered habitats, and threatened species, including the koala. He feared the laws could end up being used for purposes unrelated to bushfire risk. “I’m particularly concerned by coastal rural land that’s held by developers who may have an intention for future rezoning,” he said. “They would be allowed to clear their boundaries whether or not they had a fence, effectively degrading the environmental values of their land – not for bushfire protection but to assist with future rezoning applications.” There are also questions about how the proposed changes would interact with existing land-clearing laws that have caused turmoil inside the government in recent months. The lower house has passed amendments to local land services laws to exempt private rural landholders from having to recognise the expanded definition of koala habitat under the koala state environmental planning policy (Sepp) that nearly split the Coalition. If the changes pass the upper house, they would grandfather the arrangements under the koala Sepp for the five councils that already have approved koala plans of management. But the Environmental Defenders Office said if additional councils completed their own plans in future, the changes would allow private landholders to continue to do code-based land-clearing without an approval. Rachel Walmsley, the EDO’s policy and law reform director, said the deal reached between the Liberal and National parties was “not about clarifying the laws. It’s about weakening. “It is actually preventing koala habitat from being mapped and applicable.” NSW has already recorded huge increases in land-clearing rates as a result of changes to native vegetation laws in 2017."
"The ocean is as black as chipped obsidian, yet whichever way you look dozens of bright lights illuminate the water and the night sky. Nearly 400 nautical miles from the South American mainland, the crew of a Peruvian coastguard ship count more than 30 Chinese squid boats lighting up the sea like a city at night. Some of the boats shine luminous green, others glow blinding white like an alien spacecraft in a movie. Rigged along each side of the ships, incandescent lamps attract giant squid near the surface, where they can be hauled from the ocean by long metal arms jutting over the water. The coastguard cutter Río Cañete drifts within 100 metres of a squid jigger, and the men on each boat gaze at each other across the water. The Chinese fishermen work in silence; the crew of the Peruvian boat is also hushed – none of them has witnessed such a scene before. “This is just part of a considerable fleet off our coastal waters,” says Commander Eduardo Atkins, looking out from the bridge of the 55-metre patrol boat. “They’ve always been off our coasts, from Ecuador to Argentina, [but ] this time there’s been more media attention and the public feel affected. Our job is to dissuade them from entering our maritime domain.” The Guardian recently joined the Peruvian coastguard on a four-day patrol into international waters which came amid growing tension over the presence of the huge Chinese fleet off the coast of South America – some of the richest fishing grounds in the world. More than 250 Chinese ships were first detected in July as they skirted territorial waters off the Galápagos Islands, stirring outrage in Ecuador and raising global concern about the practices of the world’s largest distant-water fishing fleet. Hawkeye 360, a radio frequency data analytics firm, reported that boats were “going dark” by switching off their AIS satellite tracking and entering the islands’ exclusive economic zone. “We found multiple examples of maritime radio frequency activity that is within the Galápagos exclusive economic zone adjacent to the Chinese fleet,” said HawkEye 360’s CEO, John Serafini. “These signals don’t align with any AIS tracking. Although the activity could represent legitimate vessels, at the very least it is suspicious behaviour,” he said. Earlier that day, the Río Cañete heaved and shuddered through the machine-grey waves as a coastguard officer read out ships’ names from the radar scanner. Commander Atkins steered the cutter south-west directly towards the cluster of Chinese vessels. “We can clearly see the name of the ship Hangong Yu 303,” he said into a radiotelephone, reading out its coordinates on the ship’s bridge. Then it came into view: the Hangong Yu 303 was a large red oil tanker, and it was refueling a smaller squid jigger, pipes connecting the two across the waves. Atkins dispatched coastguard officers in one of the cutter’s two RIBs (rigid inflatable boat) to get a closer look, but the fishing boat quickly disconnected from the tanker and headed off in the other direction. The Chinese ships regularly refuel on the open ocean in order to extend their voyage as long as possible, said Atkins. “It’s not illegal but it’s considered bad practice,” he added through his white Covid face mask. “They can be here for months and months, possibly changing their crews, but the boats remain here in the South Pacific.” After more than 30 years with the coastguard, he could not hide his unease at the scale of the Chinese presence in the South Pacific, which has grown by roughly four times in nine years, according to Global Fishing Watch. “They have factory boats which process the catch and the product arrives packaged and ready to eat in China,” he said. It was one of these mother ships that Atkins wanted to find. He could see Han Feng 806, a refrigerated container ship, or reefer, on the radar to the south-west but as he turned the cutter to give chase, the factory ship steered a course further out to sea. Han Feng 806 stayed just out of reach. The following day, Atkins changed course, steering east and then north, along the the 200-nautical mile limit of Peruvian waters. The cutter’s twin 800 horsepower engines powered it smoothly along with the Humboldt current which swells up from Antarctica bringing nutrient-rich cold water along the coasts of Chile and Peru. The current gives its name to the species of giant squid which flourishes in its waters. But there is genuine concern among local fishing associations that China’s harvesting of the Humboldt squid will inevitably hurt Peru’s fishery exports, of which the squid accounts for 43%. “It’s an open secret that every year vessels mainly from China … come just at the edge of the 200-mile mark off Peru to extract this resource,” said Cayetana Aljovín, president of Peru’s National Fishing Society. While South American countries impose quotas on their Humboldt squid catches, there are no limits on vessels in international waters. About 800,000 tonnes of the fast-growing, highly migratory species are caught annually. Overfishing of the squid could have an impact across the eastern Pacific, said Gustavo Sánchez, a marine biologist studying the species with Japan’s Hiroshima University. “These squid might have more than a single genetic population cohabiting in the eastern Pacific waters, implying that overexploitation in international waters does not only mean fewer squid for Peru but also squid less resilient to environmental change over a more extended region,” he said. There was nothing on the horizon as the coastguard cutter surged forward under an overcast sky. Petrels and shearwaters skimmed the swell and occasionally flying fish launched themselves before the bow. A sperm whale spouted and then breached just two hundred metres from the ship, lifting spirits among the crew. “It’s a good omen, boys,” Atkins pronounced. Hours passed uneventfully before an officer with binoculars spotted something on the starboard bow. Nearly 100 nautical miles from land a little white fishing boat bobbed on the ocean, so small it barely registered on the radar. Atkins set a course towards it. A mechanical arm lowered the eight-man RIB off the stern and armed coastguards climbed down to it from a rope ladder, ready to inspect the suspect craft. The eight-metre Rosario had been drifting for two days with a broken outboard motor. All that its four-man crew – two seasoned Peruvian fishermen and two younger Venezuelans – had left was a large bunch of bananas, a bag of buns and some bottles of Gatorade. But what shocked the coastguard officers was the Rosario’s catch: hidden in nets stowed on the deck were four dead common dolphins, including one infant, and six sharks. Despite the mask over his face, it was clear that the skipper, Juan Ramos, knew he had been caught red-handed. Catching dolphins and selling their meat is illegal in Peru, but butchered porpoises are used as shark bait or sold as a delicacy known as muchame or chancho del mar on the black market. “Unfortunately we caught a few dolphins but that was not my intention,” Ramos, 52, said. “If the motor was in good condition I would have got them out [of the net],” he insisted. But the coastguards doubted his story: someone had cut the tail fins from two of the dolphins to stop them breaking out of the net. Junior officer Nicolás Castro asked Ramos for his permits and port departure documents, but he had none. Despite their predicament, Ramos, an old sea dog, said if they hoisted a sail they would be back in Ancón, their port of departure, in 12 days. “Before, years ago, we fished there by the shore. Now look where we are! If we fished by the shore now we wouldn’t catch anything,” he said. “This all comes from bad globalization. It’s not just the Chinese squid fishing boats, there are tuna fishing boats from other countries too, they come and break our nets.” He said small-scale fishermen could not compete. “The big problem in Peru is we don’t have the technology. But [the foreign fleets] have factory ships, they can get anywhere and catch tonnes and tonnes [of fish] and take it away, processed.” Matt Bjerregaard, a specialist in marine biodiversity and fisheries, said climate change is forcing artisanal fishermen to follow the fish into deeper water, further from shore. But large foreign fishing fleets are also to blame, he said, forcing fishermen “to search for new fishing areas, take longer to find their catch and, in turn, this has a negative impact on their livelihoods”. Despite the seizure, the boat’s net was still cast – and some 50 metres away a sea lion struggled to free itself. Castro jumped on to the RIB clasping a kitchen knife and motored towards the stricken animal which thrashed wildly, entangling itself more. “Come on, come on, you’ll be free soon,” said Castro, leaning over the bow to cut the green mesh as the sea lion bit furiously at a yellow float. Castro struggled for 20 minutes until finally the net could be hauled over the animal’s head and it disappeared with a splash. “Go, go, be free, be free!” shouted Castro, brimming with emotion and trembling from the physical effort. “How beautiful, damn it! I’m thrilled I was able to free it.” It was an emotional end to the encounter. The fishermen and their illegal catch were taken back to the Río Cañete to be taken to the harbour master’s office in port and probably fined; their catch would be examined by experts from the fishing ministry. The Rosario and its broken motor was left adrift on the ocean. Meanwhile, the controversial Chinese fleet continued to move south, prompting Chile to announce that its navy would monitor its movements. “What began as an arrest for an illegal act became a search and rescue operation,” said Atkins – pleased the mission had a satisfactory ending, but perhaps frustrated that he had to be content with the small fry while the big fish got away."
"Across the world, conservationists, scientists and volunteers are racing to save thousands of endangered species. And for some, their efforts have not been wasted. A recent report found that conservation programmes have saved several bird and mammal species from extinction in recent decades. But the numbers of many data deficient species and sub-species continue to dwindle – and how do you save a species if it hasn’t even been recognised?  “There are so many species for which we have no information whatsoever. If we want to conserve them, we need to know about their habitat, their food preferences, the genetic diversity and health of the population, and so on,” says Rudolf Meier, a professor at the National University of Singapore. While DNA barcoding is increasingly becoming an invaluable tool in the identification of species, the best way to collect that DNA is still being debated. The answer may lie in one of nature’s most basic products: poo. “In the past, we had to do two to three years of fieldwork to gather even the most basic information about a species,” says Meier. “Now, with faecal analysis, we can gather information much faster. Not only are we able to extract the host DNA, we also get to learn about its diet, gut flora and parasite load.” It was faecal analysis that saw a recent breakthrough for Meier and his colleagues from Singapore, Indonesia and the UK in confirming three new species of banded langurs. The Raffles’ banded langur and the East Sumatran banded langur were formerly considered sub-species of the langur species Presbytis femoralis. But the two south-east Asian primates have now been confirmed as species in their own right, thus qualifying them to be listed as critically endangered according to IUCN red list criteria. A third species identified by the team, the Robinson’s banded langur, is considered near threatened. All three langurs have black bodies with only slight variations in the white markings on their faces, limbs and abdomens and so were long thought to have belonged to one fairly widespread species. They rarely descend to the forest floor and are extremely shy and elusive, making it difficult to monitor and photograph them. The study, Faecal DNA to the Rescue, notes the difficulty in collecting data for rare species because “invasive sampling yielding fresh tissues is usually not feasible”. “This leaves only three alternative sources of DNA,” it says. “The first is museum specimens, but the number of samples in museums tends to be small and many were collected in the 19th or early 20th century thus reflecting historical genetic diversity prior to extensive habitat loss. The second is tissue samples obtained from specimens that died of “natural causes” such as road accidents. The third source of genetic material is noninvasive samples such as hair and faeces.” Faecal samples can be gathered during routine field surveys but it is not an easy task. It requires long hours of monitoring in sometimes harsh outdoor conditions. To ensure that an animal does not feel threatened, researchers must wait for the individual to move away after defecation before approaching the faeces. Andie Ang, a research scientist at the Wildlife Reserves Singapore Conservation Fund and one of the paper’s co-authors adds: “It’s difficult to see the langur droppings on the soil as it is mostly brown in colour. Sometimes, when the langur defecates, the poop hits a branch or leaves [on its way down] and gets scattered all over the forest floor. Then we are looking for extremely small pieces of scat. It can get very difficult to spot. “Sometimes, the faeces are smelly enough to be detected, other times we look out for shit flies or follow dung beetles. We are euphoric when we find a good faecal sample!” Despite the challenges, an upside of gathering faecal samples is that it is noninvasive and does not require the animal to be captured. Unlike blood sampling or using ear clips it does not disturb or stress the animal. For the study, DNA was extracted from the langur faecal samples using commercially available kits, and the genetic material was then sent to an external facility for sequencing. The sequenced data consisted of a minuscule amount of monkey DNA, along with DNA of the food it had consumed, parasite DNA and an overwhelmingly large amount of bacterial DNA. Amrita Srivathsan, a researcher at the National University of Singapore and one of the paper’s co-authors says: “We isolated the langur DNA sequences using bioinformatics and complete mitochondrial genomes were reconstructed from it.” Srivathsan says: “I had mixed feelings about the confirmation of the three banded langurs as distinct species. Their populations are small and fragmented, which is extremely worrying. But at least now, they can get the urgent attention needed for their conservation. “The information from faecal analysis is vital in understanding the ecology of the species. It will help create targeted conservation strategies,” she adds. In Singapore, only about 60 individuals of the Raffles’ banded langur (Presbytis femoralis) remain in one restricted forest patch, while across the Johor Strait, in southern peninsular Malaysia, numbers are also dwindling (population of 250-300 individuals), because of the impact of the rapid increase of palm oil plantations. The East Sumatran banded langur (Presbytis percura), found in the Riau province of the Indonesian island, has lost large portions of its habitat to logging and private plantations. Small groups of the primate are now found scattered inside traditional rubber plantations, where some natural vegetation still exists. Rizaldi, a primatologist from Andalas University in West Sumatra and another of the paper’s co-authors, says: “Since we don’t have sufficient data about this species, it is not considered a protected primate in Indonesia. Our paper describing it as a species is a crucial first step towards its conservation.” He hopes that the IUCN reassessment will bring much-needed local and international support for the protection of the species. “We cannot afford to delay,” he says. Nadine Ruppert, head of the Primate Research and Conservation Lab at the Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang says: “Now that there is a better understanding of the distribution boundaries and relative population sizes of the three species, more specific research and conservation action plans can be tailored for each species in their respective habitats.” Meier, who is also one of the co-authors of the paper, feels faecal analysis is not utilised by researchers as much as it should be, something he would like to see change. “As much as we joke about ‘shitty science’ in the lab, there is an enormous amount of biological information in animal scat,” he says.

"The radioactivity of airborne particles increases significantly downwind of fracking sites in the US, a study has found. The Harvard scientists said this could damage the health of people living in nearby communities and that further research was needed to understand how to stop the release of the radioactive elements from under the ground. The radioactivity rose by 40% compared with the background level in the most affected sites. The increase will be higher for people living closer than 20km to the fracking sites, which was the closest distance that could be assessed with the available data. The scientists used data collected from 157 radiation-monitoring stations across the US between 2001 and 2017. The stations were built during the cold war when nuclear war was a threat. They compared data with the position and production records of 120,000 fracking wells. “Our results suggest that an increase in particle radioactivity due to the extensive [fracking development] may cause adverse health outcomes in nearby communities,” the team concluded. Petros Koutrakis at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston, who led the study, said: “If you asked me to go and live downwind [of fracking sites], I would not go. People should not go crazy, but I think it’s a significant risk that needs to be addressed.” Previous work has shown that chemicals released during fracking could pose a health risk to children and the process has contaminated groundwater in some places. Fracking is also an issue in the forthcoming presidential election, particularly in swing states such as Pennsylvania. Donald Trump has falsely claimed Joe Biden will ban fracking but the Democratic presidential candidate is largely supportive of fracking and only backs a ban on federal lands and offshore. The new research, published in the journal Nature Communications, examined the increases in the radioactivity of airborne particles when there were operational fracking wells within 20km upwind of a location. With 100 wells upwind the average rise in radioactivity was 7%, but some places had nearly 600 wells upwind. The team took into account other factors, including weather and sunspot activity. Cosmic rays produced by sunspots increase the levels of particle radioactivity. The researchers found that fracking resulted in a far bigger increase in particle radioactivity than conventional oil and gas operations. This is because the initial source of the radioactivity is a uranium isotope in the rocks. Tapping a conventional oil and gas reservoir barely disturbs the rock. But in the shale formations targeted by frackers the oil and gas is trapped within the rock, which is blasted apart with high-pressure water and releases the uranium. The uranium isotope decays to the gas radon, which itself decays to ultrafine radioactive particles containing polonium and lead. These are thought to become attached to particles already in the air and are then carried by the wind. “The polonium isotopes are the ones which are very toxic,” said Koutrakis. The element was used as a poison to kill the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. Koutrakis said previous studies have shown that increases in particle radioactivity of the scale seen in his work can have harmful effects on people. The biggest increases were seen in Marcellus and Utica shale fields below Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, as these rocks contain more uranium than in other fracking regions, such as Texas and North and South Dakota. “This investigation backs up its big conclusions with big data, making the conclusions convincing,” said Marco Kaltofen, at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, who was not part of the research team. Wastewater from fracking is also known to have elevated radioactivity, but Kaltofen said: “We shouldn’t ask how airborne radioactive risk from fracking compares to the waterborne risk. We should ask if it’s a good idea to add radioactive particulates to either air or water. This study suggests that the answer is no.” Koutrakis said it is not known if the radon mostly leaks during initial drilling of the wells, as leaks of methane during production, or from the wastewater produced and stored at the sites. Finding this out could allow operations to be changed to stop the leaks, he said. “Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our workers, the local environment and the communities where we live, operate and raise families, and we take each report of safety or health issues related to our operations very seriously,” said Reid Porter, spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute. “US natural gas and oil companies meet or exceed strict federal and state regulations and also undergo regular inspections to ensure that all materials are managed, stored, transported, and disposed of safely.” "
"Australian scientists have discovered a detached reef more than 500 metres high – taller than the Empire State Building – at the northern end of the Great Barrier Reef. The “blade-like” vertical reef about 130km off Cape York, Australia’s north-eastern tip, was found during a 3D seabed mapping exercise conducted from a ship owned by the Californian non-profit Schmidt Ocean Institute. Tom Bridge, from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University and the expedition’s principal investigator, said the reef was 1.5km wide at its base and rose half a kilometre to within 40 metres of the surface. It is the first large detached reef found in the area since the late 19th century when seven others were discovered over a 150km stretch of ocean, Bridge said. “It’s a big reef not to have known about,” he said. “What it highlights is how little we know about a lot of the ocean, even the Great Barrier Reef. The marine park is 344,000 square kilometres – bigger than many European countries – and only about 6 or 7% of that is typical shallow-water reefs. “We know more about the surface of the moon than we know about what lies in the depths beyond our coastlines.” Detached reefs are bedded to the ocean floor off the continental shelf but are not part of the main body of the Great Barrier Reef. The newly discovered reef does not appear to have a lot of hard corals in its upper section, but has “an incredible abundance” of sponges, sea fans and soft corals, suggesting the area is rich in nutrients carried by strong currents and upwellings of deep waters. Bridge said the camera on the underwater robot used to explore the reef showed it was home to plenty of reef fish, including tiny hatchetfish and silvertip, and grey reef sharks. Video of the discovery from the robot, known as SuBastian, was live-streamed and posted on YouTube. “To not only map the reef in 3D detail but to also see this discovery with SuBastian is incredible,” the expedition leader, Rob Beaman, said. The discovery is likely to lead to years of study. The Schmidt Ocean Institute ship, the Falkor, is on a year-long exploration of oceans surrounding Australia. Scientists aboard the ship plan to continue mapping the northern Great Barrier Reef until mid-next month. The institute said earlier discoveries on the trip included what is believed to be the longest recorded sea creature, a 45-metre siphonophore, in a canyon off the Ningaloo coast in northern Western Australia. It said it had found potentially dozens of yet-to-be-described species, including black coral, sponges and scorpionfish."

"Hollingbury golf course is a big splodge of green bleeding into Brighton’s grey urban sprawl. For more than a century, its 18 holes have risen above the seaside city towards the ruins of an iron age hillfort, which is now enclosed by holes nine, 12, 13, and 14. From Hollingbury’s highest point, it is possible to look west on a clear day and see the hills of the Isle of Wight. As housing has spread around the course, which is owned by the council, so has tension between golfers and walkers, who are permitted to cut across it on a network of footpaths and old drovers’ tracks. Relations seem calm on the autumn day I visit, but I gather “Fore!” is not the only four-letter exclamation to have bounced along the manicured fairways. In late March, the awkward relationship flipped on its head when a lockdown ban on golf coincided with a yearning for green space among Britain’s confined households. A national campaign, supported by the Brighton MP Caroline Lucas, called for golf courses to be opened to the public to relieve crowded parks. At Hollingbury, which has no fences and is part of the South Downs national park, residents responded like calves put out to pasture. They cartwheeled on the fairways and picnicked on the greens. “It was like being in the mountains up here, with that open-space feeling that makes you feel immediately better,” says Michaela Spryanova, an office administrator who lives just beyond the course’s western edge. Rachel Henson, an artist and translator, came here every day, basking in the spring sunshine and sweeping views over Brighton and the Channel. She taught her daughter to ride a bike on the sloping fairway of hole 10. “We learned all the common birdsong together,” she says. But then, in June, golf was permitted once more – and golfers reclaimed the course. “We knew it was coming, but it was a terrible shock,” Henson says as we walk with Spryanova from their children’s school after the morning drop-off. We stroll up towards the hillfort on one of the old paths to which non-golfers are again confined. “It depressed me so much I couldn’t come up here for a while,” Henson adds. The struggle for space at Hollingbury – and a second council-owned golf course two miles to the west at Waterhall – reflects a wider debate about conservation, ecology and democratic access to green space. As a pandemic triggers a revolt on many of Britain’s fairways, it poses a vexed question: is it time we opened up all golf courses to the public for good?  One of the joys and challenges of golf is that it requires a lot of nice green space. How much space is disputed. A common claim that Britain’s golf courses occupy more land than housing is based on dodgy estimates, but it is a lot of land. The American writer Malcolm Gladwell once considered the scale of gated golf courses in Los Angeles, a city of few parks. He calculated that if you gave each player on a basketball court the space a golfer commands, the court would cover 12 hectares (30 acres); the hoops would be more than 400 metres apart. “They’d have to play on motorcycles,” Gladwell wrote. Yet this calculation depends on a course being busy. Not all courses are busy. Steve Garrioch, who has been the captain at Hollingbury since 2009, tells me he was one of significantly more than 500 members when he joined 20 years ago. There are now 122 members and about twice as many season-ticket holders. Garrioch, a leather merchant, blames an oversupply: Hollingbury is one of six courses within five miles of Brighton Palace pier in a city of about 300,000 people. But its decline is not unusual. According to a participation report by KPMG late last year, membership of golf courses in Great Britain dropped to a low of slightly more than 850,000, down almost 20,000 in a year. In Scotland, membership has dropped by 14% since 2014. Yet the number of courses – more than 2,000 – is relatively stable. Hollingbury, which opened in 1908, is not exclusive. “It’s for working-class people,” Garrioch says. “We’ve got taxi drivers, builders … there’s nothing elite about it.” Yet perceptions fuelled the debate about the role of courses in lockdown. “I think a certain US president has done golf no favours,” says Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner and the author of Who Owns England?. For Shrubsole, Donald Trump – and the eponymous courses on which he has played out a large part of his presidency – exemplifies the image of golf as a gated, gilded pursuit. In early April, when many councils threatened to shut the gates of crowded parks, Shrubsole launched a petition at change.org calling for golf courses to be opened. More than 7,500 people signed it. Lockdown was highlighting space inequality; studies show that people in poorer postcodes not only have smaller gardens, or none at all, but also less access to smaller parks. Pushing open the gates of golf courses began to feel like a moral imperative. “There’s a sense that golf is played by a small number of people and that they are potentially quite wealthy, retired, white men who don’t necessarily represent society,” Shrubsole says. It is not known how many courses opened to the public. It was a fraught process for many that did. “We had nudity on the greens and kids riding bikes straight over the bunkers,” Garrioch says. Elsewhere, there were reports of quad biking, horse riding and rampant picnicking. One couple were spotted playing a rather different sport in a bunker at Glenbervie golf club near Falkirk in central Scotland. “This isn’t Butlin’s,” an anonymous member of the club told the Daily Record. “It’s frustrating that members aren’t even allowed to get their daily exercise by playing a round on their own in the fresh air, yet you’ve got locals having sex in the bunkers. Where’s the social distancing in that?” But for the responsible majority, including Henson, Spryanova and their families, the overnight arrival of new parks was a revelation. “I wanted to shift debate and say there was something deeper going on here – this was about our exclusion from public space and our inability to provide enough of it,” Shrubsole says. That debate was big in Brighton before the pandemic. Ten-year management contracts at Hollingbury and Waterhall were due to expire on 31 March. “It came up at pretty much my first committee meeting last year,” says Marianna Ebel, a German-born IT engineer who was elected as a Green party councillor for Goldsmid ward in May 2019. Brexit inspired Ebel, 35, to enter local politics. She is now the joint chair of the council’s tourism, equalities, communities and culture committee, so council-owned golf courses are her responsibility. For a while, it was assumed a new operator would simply take over the leases. “But I remember looking at the membership numbers,” Ebel says. “I thought: ‘Instead of continuing, how about rewilding the courses?’” In October, the council appointed an estate agent to market the courses, offering 25-year management leases. But they also invited bids for other uses, including projects to restore the wildlife-rich chalk grassland on which the courses were laid.  “We simply cannot miss this exciting opportunity to create a health & wellbeing sanctuary and a wildlife haven for all,” read a petition launched in late December by the Brighton branch of Extinction Rebellion (XR), the environmental campaign group. Counter-petitions called for golf to be saved. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrats in the city pushed for the space to be used for affordable housing. More than 5,000 people signed the rewilding petition, including Chris Packham, the presenter and campaigner. In January, XR Brighton held a protest outside a committee meeting. They marched on Hollingbury. “We’re not anti-golf,” insists Ben Benatt, an ecology surveyor and XR member. “It’s about a sustainable solution that addresses the climate and biodiversity emergency.” In January, the council awarded a new contract for Hollingbury, securing its future as a golf course. It was a blow to campaigners and the families who had roamed the course. But the council also announced that Waterhall, where membership was in steeper decline, would shut down for a rare experiment: the rewilding of a golf course. “They call chalk grassland rainforests in miniature,” says Kim Greaves, as we crouch low on the first green at Waterhall. The 37-year-old played here briefly as a teenager. These days, he works with adults with learning disabilities and teaches Brazilian jujitsu, a martial art that relies on skilful leverage. He is also an amateur naturalist and part of the campaign to restore Waterhall. Golfers abandoned the course when lockdown stopped play just seven days before the old lease expired. It had stood here since 1923. Six months later, the greens are cracking up. Daisies and ragwort are growing and the old holes and bunkers are filling with soil and debris. The clubhouse, which sits just above the first green, has sweeping downland views. There is one proposal to move the building towards a rugby club, where dog walkers now park to enjoy the old course, and turn it into an education centre. For now, it is a symbol of a lost era. Abandoned trophies left in the window of the Spike Bar collect dust next to a golf glove, on which a large bumblebee has expired. The very thin layer of soil that covers chalk in valleys across the south-east of England – the result of centuries of grazing – lets rain drain straight through it. Nutrients are scant, so dominant grasses, and the shrubs and trees that would succeed them, tend not to do well. Instead, an array of resilient wildflowers cling to the earth, supporting rare species of butterfly and birds. Diversity on the old greens is still low; it will take years for the effects of mowing and pesticides to be flushed out. But Greaves wants to show me what is happening on the fringes of the fairways. Wildflowers with evocative names – betony, harebell, devil’s-bit scabious, lady’s bedstraw – are creeping in from the rough. “I even saw a round-headed rampion in the middle of the fairway,” Greaves says of a survey he did in the summer. “It might have been there without flowering for decades.” The delicate blue flower, also known as the Pride of Sussex, is a magnet for the chalkhill blue butterfly. Rewilding here will require management. Without any intervention, ecological succession will do its thing, even on thin soil. Last month, the council took responsibility for the project after a leaseholder pulled out. Greaves is anxious to start controlling the hawthorn that is already dominating areas between fairways. In other ecosystems, big fauna would do this kind of work. “Perhaps we’ll introduce elephants here eventually,” Greaves says with a smile. Golf still offers pleasure and exercise to hundreds of thousands of people. Many clubs enjoyed a growth in visitor numbers when they reopened in June; golf is nothing if not a socially distanced sport. Even XR Brighton says a sensitively managed links is far from the worst way to preserve green space, “especially if it brings a revenue stream that can help manage it in the right way”, Benatt says. Housing can be an obvious – and lucrative – alternative, especially when privately owned courses can rescue their finances with a sale to developers. Reading golf club, another old, struggling course, will next year merge with Caversham Heath, a club two miles to the west. A controversial housing development will take its place. But Waterhall’s fate adds weight to campaigns for old courses to remain green yet public, making permanent the freedom that excluded communities briefly enjoyed this year. Four years ago, Lewisham council closed a municipal 18-hole golf course that had occupied an old Georgian estate in Beckenham, south-east London. It is now a public park with a restored lake for swimming and boating. “It shows what local campaigns can do,” Shrubsole says. It will take time for balance to be restored at Hollingbury. Today, walkers and joggers outnumber golfers by far. “It’s just getting ridiculous,” says Brian Coomber, a club member who is looking for his ball in the rough next to the 10th fairway. He says people have been using the footpaths way more since golf resumed, interrupting play and messing up the fairways. “Don’t get me wrong, I’ve got a dog myself, but at the end of the day this isn’t common land,” he says. His friend, Dave Slocombe, nods in agreement. Days later, the men leave Hollingbury to join East Brighton golf club, which is only three miles away. Henson and Spryanova still walk on Hollingbury, where Spryanova says a few comments from golfers have made her children feel uncomfortable on their walk to school. Lockdown inspired Henson’s art. She made videos of the course, in which images of cartwheeling children fade into more recent footage of golf. Birds sing in the background. As we stand at the hillfort, taking in the sweep of Brighton, she can still picture those weeks. “At sunset, everyone would have been sitting here looking west, each little group taking a mound,” she says. “It looked a bit like a very spaced out village green.”"
"“Zombie batteries” are causing hundreds of fires a year at waste and recycling sites, industry experts have warned. They are urging people to ensure dead batteries are not thrown away in household rubbish or recycling. Batteries discarded with general waste are likely to be crushed or punctured during collection and processing, according to the Environmental Services Association (Esa). Some types, particularly lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries, can ignite or explode when damaged and set fire to other materials. In some cases, this leads to incidents requiring dozens of firefighters and the evacuation of residents, potentially putting lives at risk. Lithium-ion batteries are believed to have been responsible for at least 250 fires at recycling and waste facilities across the UK in the year to March 2020. These fires represented more than a third of all fires reported, up from a quarter the year before. Lithium-ion batteries are typically found in laptops, tablets, mobile phones, Bluetooth devices, shavers, electric toothbrushes, power tools and e-cigarettes. They are increasingly prevalent in devices, says Esa, meaning the problem is likely to get worse unless people change their behaviour. People in the UK throw away 22,000 tonnes of batteries a year, according to Esa, but only 45% are recycled properly. “Fires caused by carelessly discarded batteries endanger lives, cause millions of pounds of damage and disrupt waste services,” said Jacob Hayler, Esa’s executive director. “We urge consumers to please recycle batteries responsibly by using battery recycling points in shops and recycling centres, or a separate battery kerbside collection if available.” Mark Andrews, who leads on waste fires for the National Fire Chiefs Council, said: “Batteries in household waste and recycling can lead to large-scale and protracted fires. These incidents are often very challenging for fire services to deal with and can cause significant disruption to communities.” Esa’s new Take Charge campaign asks the public to “join the fight against zombie batteries” and gives information on where to recycle batteries responsibly."
"One of Britain’s largest spiders has been discovered on a Ministry of Defence training ground in Surrey having not been seen in the country for 21 years. The great fox-spider is a night-time hunter, known for its speed and agility, as well as its eight black eyes which give it wraparound vision. The critically endangered spider was thought to be extinct in Britain after last being spotted in 1999 in Dorset’s Morden Bog. The arachnid, two inches wide (5cm) including legs, had previously also been spotted at another Dorset site, and on Hankley Common in Surrey. These are the only three areas in Britain, all in the comparatively warmer south, where it has been recorded. Mike Waite from Surrey Wildlife Trust discovered the elusive spider after two years of trawling around after dark looking for it on the Surrey military site, which the MoD is not naming for security reasons.  “As soon as my torch fell on it I knew what it was. I was elated. With coronavirus there have been lots of ups and downs this year, and I also turned 60, so it was a good celebration of that. It’s a gorgeous spider, if you’re into that kind of thing,” said Waite. The great fox-spider is one of the largest members of the wolf-spider family, hunting spiders that do not use webs to catch prey. It chases down beetles, ants and smaller spiders before pouncing on them and injecting deadly venom. The prey is immobilised and its internal organs liquefy. The spider – which poses no risk to humans – feeds using fang-bearing jaws. M0D sites are often kept open because military exercises cause minor disturbance to the vegetation, which stops succession of shrubs and trees. Waite used aerial photos to find bare sandy patches, which suit the spider’s ambush-style hunting techniques, and spotted the first one next to Jeep tracks. In total, he found several males, one female and some unidentifiable immature spiderlings. Nick Baker, TV presenter and a patron of the British Arachnological Society, described the discovery as “the most exciting thing to happen in wildlife circles for quite some time”. He said: “It’s about as handsome as a spider gets, it’s big and now it’s officially a member of the British fauna again.” The great fox-spider, a native species, was first found 120 years ago and has been seen only a handful of times since. Despite their size, the spiders are difficult to spot because they are mainly nocturnal and have effective mottled brown camouflage. During winter, they dig burrows under rocks and line them with silk, going into a sort of hibernation state. The MoD heathland where the spider was found is managed by the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust. It is recognised as a nationally important site for populations of rare birds, reptiles and invertebrates, especially sand lizards, smooth snakes, Dartford warbler and nightjar. MoD sites are often good for wildlife because they are protected from human activity and are large enough to give wildlife space to move. The great fox-spider likes warmer climates and is more common on the European mainland, particularly on coastal sand dunes in Holland and Denmark. “It makes me think how hard have we looked for it on our coasts? Have we been looking hard enough?” said Waite, who believes the spider could be more widespread than people think. Waite is now conducting nocturnal great fox-spider hunting expeditions on neighbouring sites and hopes one day to write a scientific paper about them. “It seems to be the most important thing I’ve done in a long career. It has inspired me to make something of it and find out as much as I can about this species in the UK,” he said.  This article was amended on 5 November 2020. Based on information provided by the Surrey Wildlife Trust, an earlier version said that the great fox-spider was last seen 27 years ago in 1993 on Hankley Common in Surrey, and referred to Nick Baker as the president of the British Arachnological Society. The last sighting is believed to have been in 1999 on Morden Bog in Dorset, and Baker is a patron of the society.

"In the 1980s, when Kevin Dahl first began visiting the Organ Pipe Cactus national monument in southern Arizona, the border was unmarked, save for a simple fence used to keep cattle from a ranch in the US from crossing into Mexico. In those days, park rangers would call in their lunch orders at a diner located just across the border. Since then, a 30ft steel bollard wall has replaced the old barbed wire fence at Organ Pipe. The towering steel barrier cuts through the Unesco reserve like a rust-colored suture. “It’s this incredible scar,” said Kevin Dahl, a senior program manager at the National Parks Conservation Association, describing the wall that snakes its way through a pristine track of Sonoran desert, dwarfing the giant cacti that give this desert its name. “What was once a connected landscape is now a dissected one.” That dissection is now a reality across much of the US border. It is a landscape increasingly defined by walls, roads, fences and associated border infrastructure that is fragmenting critically protected habitats, desecrating sacred cultural sites and threatening numerous endangered species in some of the most biodiverse and unique places in North America. “Border construction has had a huge impact on some of the most remote and biodiverse landscapes on the continent,” said Dan Millis, a campaigner at the Sierra Club. “The Trump administration is taking it even further.” Four days before the US election, this is how the new border wall has affected four distinct wilderness areas. Donald Trump entered the Oval Office with a campaign promise to build 450 miles of a new “border wall system” – a combination of infrastructure including bollard barriers, roads, perimeter lighting, enforcement cameras and other technology – even amid the pandemic, has continued at an increasing pace. According to Customs and Border Protection, 400 miles of the border wall system has been completed so far, with physical barriers from 18-30ft tall. If he wins, he may well aspire to wall off the border in its entirety. Construction is occurring mostly on public, often protected lands, because the Department of Homeland Security has sweeping powers to waive environmental protection laws, like the Endangered Species Act, which would otherwise bar construction. Protected lands “belong to the government because they are so unique and fragile. Because of that same fact, they are being demolished,” said Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, noting the relative ease of border wall construction on public lands compared with the lengthy process of taking private property. The eastern terminus is the Lower Rio Grande Valley wildlife refuge in south-eastern Texas – 100,000 acres of lush protected lands that US Fish and Wildlife have spent four decades restoring. The 135 individual tracts of land, described as a “string of pearls” connecting various habitats, extend along the 275 miles of the Rio Grande River before entering the Gulf of Mexico. It is one of the most biodiverse places in the country, supporting 700 species of terrestrial animals such as the jaguarundi, a wild cat, as well as myriad plants and a vibrant ecotourism industry. The landscape is now being bisected by a 15ft concrete base surmounted by 18ft steel bollards. “It’s going to make it that much harder to preserve the very little that is left of the ecosystem,” said Norma Herrera of the Rio Grande Equal Voice Network. “This is some of the best birding in the world,” said Elise Wort, a tourist who traveled from her California home to see some of the 500-plus bird species that reside in the valley. “The border is an environmental and human disaster.” Much of the construction in the south-western border states is occurring in remote and mountainous terrain. Critics say it makes little sense to construct a physical barrier in these areas because most are lightly trafficked corridors for unauthorized migration, and they are also crucial habitat for animals. Ninety-three endangered and threatened animal species are found in the borderlands. One such area is the Madrean Sky Islands, rugged linked mountain ranges in New Mexico and Arizona that boast the highest biodiversity in inland North America. “It’s like going from the climate on the Mexican border to Canada,” said Emily Burns, program director of the Sky Island Alliance, with ecosystems ranging from subtropical lowlands and deserts to temperate mountaintops. The 30ft steel wall and stadium lighting are adversely affecting the ocelot, javelina, Mexican grey wolf and the North American jaguar, the latter of which has made a surprising comeback in the US since being hunted to extinction in the late 1980s, according to Burns’s organization. “We don’t expect there will be any hope for the jaguar’s recovery in the US if [the border is] completed,” said Burns, because it will cut off the main Jaguar population in Mexico from that in the US. Further east in Arizona, new sections of steel bollard wall are being built in the largest area of protected Sonoran landscape. At the San Bernardino national wildlife refuge, groundwater pumping to mix concrete for the wall is draining a crucial wetland and imperiling four threatened or endangered species for which San Bernardino was created to protect. Government documents obtained by environmental groups revealed that the US Fish and Wildlife Service repeatedly warned the Department of Homeland Security about the imminent threat to these species. Their warning went unheeded. “I started my career as a biologist at the Refuge, and 20 years later, I came full circle to witness its destruction,” said Myles Traphagen, borderlands program coordinator for the Wildlands Network, an environmental group. Construction during the Trump administration has severely affected tribal lands along the border, leading to a growing protest movement in response to desecration of sacred sites and barred access to ancestral lands. “Our tribal sovereignty is not being upheld,” said Jacelle Ramon-Sauberan, a doctoral candidate of Indian studies at the University of Arizona and a member of the Tohono O’odham Nation, who lands have been split by the wall, stifling cross-border cultural and religious events between O’odham members in Mexico and the US. “I don’t think it ever has been when it comes to the border wall or the border in general.” At Organ Pipe Cactus national monument in Arizona, part of the ancestral lands of the Tohono O’odham nation, a particular flashpoint has been the impact of the border wall on the sacred Quitobaquito springs. A recent analysis by data scientists at the investigative journalism website Bellingcat found that water levels at Quitobaquito springs are declining at unprecedented rates, with border wall construction a likely culprit because crews have tapped the underlying aquifer for water to make concrete. On 12 October – Indigenous Peoples’ Day – O’odham members and their allies blockaded the highway passing through Organ Pipe. Border officers responded with force, including teargas, arresting eight in the process. Earlier this year, construction crews used dynamite to blow up Monument hill in Organ Pipe to make way for the wall, disturbing O’odham burial grounds and uprooting numerous Organ Pipe and Saguaro Cactus scattered along the service roads, which evoked felled green monoliths. A recent decision by a federal appeals court has provided at least one win for border wall critics, and a blow to Trump’s ambitions to complete the 450 miles of the wall by year’s end. The ninth circuit court of appeals ruled that the president’s use of emergency powers to allocate military funds for border wall construction was illegal. Even so, construction will continue on projects where military money was not used – including the four described here. “This wall has done nothing more than divide our communities, disrespect our values, and inflict enormous environmental harm,” said the Arizona congressman Raúl Grijalva, whose district includes Organ Pipe. “It’s time for wall construction to end once and for all.”"
"A dense conifer plantation beside this steep road into the forest, which hid a magnificent vista across the valley for half a human lifetime, has been felled. The bare hillside will be reforested but, before the next timber crop blocks the view again, the decaying stumps of its predecessor will become a niche for plants that first evolved half a billion years ago. Mosses and liverworts, arriving by air as invisible spores, thrive on these flat, porous surfaces left by chainsaws, free from the shade cast by surrounding brambles and ferns. Some recently cut stumps are already showing signs of colonisation; deeper in the forest I found others, felled a decade ago, that have become luxuriant moss gardens. Ground-hugging mosses and liverworts were early land colonisers but never acquired the capacity to make woody stems and grow tall. The rest of the plant kingdom did, leading to the evolution of forests that relegated these diminutive plants to life in the shadows. Crouching down here to examine the tree-stump mossy microcosms, I could imagine what a treeless planet, clad only in ankle-high vegetation, might once have looked like. There were delicate, ground-hugging shoots of bifid crestwort. Leafy liverworts like this are evolution’s early experiment in producing leaves – just one cell thick, translucent as stained glass. You need a hand lens to appreciate their delicate beauty; then their teeming microfauna, of nematode worms, springtails and mites, comes into focus too. On another rotting pine stump, I found juniper haircap moss, just three inches tall, its spirals of pointed leaves glistening with dewdrops. On another, emerald cushions of mosses slowly engulfing grey-green encrustations of pixie-cup lichen, a strange amalgam of fungus and alga with inch-tall spore cups, shaped like golf tees. It’s tempting to think of evolutionary success stories as inexorable advances in complexity, driven by competition. But there is another, less anthropocentric, dimension: resilience. The lowly organisms in front of me, whose origins span unimaginable geological timescales, now colonising remains of fallen giants, survived cataclysmic global mass extinctions. Mobility, as spores carried everywhere on the wind, has been their enduring asset in an ever-changing world."
"The Trump administration has removed endangered species protections from the gray wolf, a species once persecuted to near-extinction in the US, in a move that has been condemned as premature by conservationists. The wolves have been provided federal protection for more than 45 years but this is no longer needed according to David Bernhardt, the US interior secretary, who announced the decision in Minnesota on Thursday. The species has “exceeded all conservation goals for recovery”, said Bernhardt. “Today’s announcement simply reflects the determination that this species is neither a threatened nor endangered species based on the specific factors Congress has laid out in the law.” Gray wolf numbers plummeted to around 1,000 by the 1970s after long being harassed, poisoned and shot by farmers and ranchers who considered them a threat to livestock. Since being listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the population has rebounded somewhat, with around 6,000 wolves now in the lower 48 states. But biologists point out that the wolves, which once roamed much of North America, still only occupy a tiny slice of their former habitat, confined to parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and areas in the northern reaches of the Rocky Mountains. Conservationists are keen to reintroduce wolves to states such as Colorado but it’s now uncertain whether this will be possible without federal protections, sparking a looming legal battle over the Trump administration’s deisting. “Stripping protections for gray wolves is premature and reckless,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, president of Defenders of Wildlife and a former director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. “Gray wolves occupy only a fraction of their former range and need continued federal protection to fully recover. We will be taking the US Fish and Wildlife Service to court to defend this iconic species.” With no federal safeguards, gray wolves will be subject to a patchwork of state and local laws, some of which will allow the trapping and killing of the animals. Many ranchers still view wolves as a threat to livestock, while hunters consider them unhelpful competition for deer and elk. William Perry Pendley, the acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, once wrote to Disney to complain that its movie White Fang was too kind to wolves. Protections for wolves have already been lifted in Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, leading to the deaths of more than 500 wolves in Idaho just in the past year, according to analysis by environment groups. While gray wolves have repeatedly been portrayed as a menacing threat to American rural life, scientists point out that they play an important ecological role. In a famous example, the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone national park in 1995 helped restore the health of the famed wilderness by controlling deer populations, which in turn benefited local flora. A letter to the Trump administration signed by more than 100 biologists opposing the delisting argued that any perceived threats to livestock or humans from wolves are easily manageable and that protections should remain. “In recent years, efforts to delist wolves have been motivated by local and special interests,” the scientists wrote. “As such, these efforts eviscerate the essential purpose of federal governance and the ESA, which is to conserve species insomuch as doing so is a national interest.” Since Donald Trump took office, 13 species, and now the gray wolf, have been found to be neither threatened nor endangered under the ESA, a sign, the administration said, that its conservation work has been successful. Critics, however, point out that the Trump administration has weakened the application of the act to make it much harder to list species as endangered, as well as thrown open vast tracts of wildlife habitat to oil and gas drilling, among other activities."
"During the summer, as swallows hawk for insects high over our Somerset home, they are a daily embodiment of hope and joy. When they disappear, for the colder, darker half of the year, they leave a corresponding gap in our hearts. We often say that swallows fly south for the winter. Yet, although they do travel 6,000 miles to South Africa, it is only our winter they miss – when they arrive, they enjoy a second spring and summer. I miss them more than I ever thought I would. For the first half of my life, I lived in cities and suburbs, where the swift was the classic sign of longer days and warmer weather. But when I moved to the countryside, a decade or more ago, the swallow soon displaced the swift as my favourite bird. Once in a while, I do see a lone swallow out of season. On a blustery day last November, I caught sight of a juvenile down on the coast; and once, in early December, I came across a solitary bird in the field beside my home. But I shall now have to wait until April for my next swallow fix – and it really cannot come too soon. The Swallow: A Biography, by Stephen Moss, is published by Square Peg (£12.99).

"At this time of year, agricultural burning adds to the air pollution problems across northern India and Pakistan. The region contains 16 of the 20 most polluted cities in the World Health Organization’s global PM2.5 database. But are these the most polluted places ever recorded? Lack of measurements make historic comparisons difficult, but we have some clues. More than 200 years ago, Benjamin Franklin was famously among the first scientists to study electricity in the atmosphere. Lightning is the most obvious manifestation, but air pollution also changes the electrical properties of our air. Electrical measurements near Hyde Park in about 1790 suggest 18th-century London’s particle pollution was perhaps half the annual average in the most polluted cities in modern India. By 1900, things had deteriorated. Measurements of atmospheric electricity at Kew show air pollution on the edge of London was similar to the worst Indian cities today. When first routine measurements of particle pollution began in the 1920s, central London was approximately twice as polluted as contemporary India. Stoke-on-Trent was more than four times greater.  However, in the 1920s, the UK was home to 44 million people. About 400 million people are exposed to the poor air in north India’s Ganges River basin, making it a far larger air pollution crisis."
"Since January, San Carlos Apache tribal member Wendsler Nosie Sr has been sleeping in a teepee at a campground in south-eastern Arizona’s Oak Flat, a sprawling high desert oasis filled with groves of ancient oaks and towering rock spires. It is a protest in defense of “holy ground” where the Apache have prayed and performed ceremonies for centuries. A dozen south-western Native American tribes have strong cultural ties to Oak Flat. But the Trump administration, in its waning days, has embarked on a rushed effort to transfer ownership of the area to a mining company with ties to the destruction of an Aboriginal site in Australia, the Guardian has learned. “We were in the fourth quarter with two minutes left in the game. And then Trump cheated so now we only have one minute left,” said Nosie, who was a football quarterback in high school. “Everybody has to mobilize now to fight this.” Last month tribes discovered that the date for the completion of a crucial environmental review process has suddenly been moved forward by a full year, to December 2020, even as the tribes are struggling with a Covid outbreak that has stifled their ability to respond. If the environmental review is completed before Trump leaves office, the tribes may be unable to stop the mine. In a meeting with environmental groups, local officials said that the push was occurring because “we are getting pressure from the highest level at the Department of Agriculture,” according to notes from the meeting seen by the Guardian. The department oversees the US Forest Service, which is in charge of Oak Flat. As the curtain closes on the Trump era, officials are hurrying through a host of environmentally destructive projects that will benefit corporate interests. These include opening the Arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and gas drilling and rolling back protections on endangered gray wolves. In Oak Flat, the beneficiaries will be a company called Resolution Copper and its two Anglo-Australian parent firms, the mining conglomerates Rio Tinto and BHP. “The Trump administration is cutting corners and doing a rushed job just to take care of Rio Tinto,” said the Democratic Arizona representative Raúl Grijalva. “And the fact they are doing it during Covid makes it even more disgusting. Trump and Rio Tinto know the tribes’ reaction would be very strong and public under normal circumstances but the tribes are trying to save their people right now.” Ever since 1995, when what is estimated to be one of the largest copper deposits in the world was discovered 7,000 feet beneath Oak Flat, a battle has raged pitting environmental and indigenous groups against Resolution Copper. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Oak Flat contains numerous indigenous archaeological sites dating back 1,500 years. If the mine goes forward as planned, it will consume 11 square miles, including Apache burial grounds, sacred sites, petroglyphs and medicinal plants. Resolution plans to extract 1.4m tons of copper ore by blasting beneath the surface and pulling it out through tunnels. Once all the ore is sucked out, a crater estimated to be 1,000 feet deep and almost two miles across will be left behind. There is also concern over a 400ft-high escarpment called Apache Leap that is vulnerable to the proposed mine. Named for Apache warriors who jumped off the cliff in the late 1800s to avoid capture by the US army, the site holds great historical significance for the Apache people, and memorializes tribal losses when European immigrants invaded their homeland. An independent analysis performed on behalf of the Arizona Mining Reform Coalition determined there is a 9% chance the mine’s crater could reach Apache Leap and catastrophically destabilize it. Even though the San Carlos Apache and other tribes have always been opposed to mining at Oak Flat, there are no federal laws giving Native Americans control of ancestral lands that are outside reservation boundaries. Tribes were blindsided in 2014 when a proposal to exchange federally owned Oak Flat for private land owned by Resolution Copper was included, at the last minute, in a defense spending bill. This inclusion was at the behest of four Arizona members of Congress who supported Resolution’s mining plans; the bill was signed into law by the president, Barack Obama. For the last six years, the Forest Service has been carrying out an environmental review of the proposed mine and the controversial land exchange. Numerous tribes and environmental groups have voiced their opposition in the hope the mine could be prevented from moving forward or significantly scaled back. Resolution Copper has argued that it is taking all necessary environmental precautions and has sought input from tribes. “There have been hundreds of consultations on the Resolution Copper project with Native American tribes,” wrote project director Andrew Lye in an email. “As with all tribes, Resolution Copper would welcome the opportunity for more collaborative dialogue with the San Carlos Apache tribe to build a relationship and ultimately look for ways to partner for mutual benefit.” Resolution has vowed to monitor geologic activity around Apache Leap to make sure the mine’s crater does not get too close to the sacred cliff. Lye also points to a host of community support programs funded by the company to benefit the San Carlos Apache and other tribes. These include a monitoring program where tribal members are trained by archaeologists to help identify culturally significant indigenous artifacts. Yet the recent history of Rio Tinto, one of the parent companies, has given cause for concern. Last May, Rio Tinto blasted a 46,000-year old sacred Aboriginal site in Juukan Gorge, in western Australia. After widespread public outcry and investor revolt over the destruction, Rio Tinto’s CEO and two other top executives resigned in September. “What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,” Rio Tinto’s chairman, Simon Thompson, said in a statement following the resignations. Once the final Oak Flat environmental review is released, the land exchange must happen within 60 days. Ownership of Oak Flat could transfer to Resolution Copper before Joe Biden’s 20 January inauguration. “We are looking at the destruction of some of the Apache’s most significant cultural and historic sites with this project,” said Kathryn Leonard, the Arizona state historic preservation officer. Federal historic preservation laws focus on ameliorating harms rather than blocking a development altogether, she explained. “Our preservation laws are not set up to prevent this level of loss. It weighs heavily on me.” Grijalva, who chairs the House natural resources committee, has asked the Forest Service to explain the reason for the accelerated timeline but as of late last week his staff had not received any clarification. Environmental groups are positioned to challenge the decision in court, while Grijalva and Senator Bernie Sanders have introduced a bill calling for the repeal of the land transfer. “If the land exchange happens, it will be difficult to roll back,” said Grijalva. “That is why this cannot be rushed. The Forest Service must do their due diligence because of what is at stake. The damage is irreparable.”"
"Lead shot is to be banned from all wetlands in the European Union, in a decision that is expected to pave the way for phasing out all toxic ammunition. The European parliament voted against objections lodged by far-right parties, allowing the European commission to introduce the new regulations by the end of the year. The ban will ensure that any wildfowl or waterbirds are shot with non-toxic steel ammunition after scientific studies found that 1 million waterbirds are killed by lead poisoning each year. Millions more wild birds, including raptors, are poisoned but do not die, with 40% of whooper swans found to have elevated blood lead levels. If the regulations come into force before the end of the Brexit transition period, they will become UK law. This would compel some grouse shoots to use non-toxic ammunition because certain grouse moors are peatlands and are classified as wetlands according to the EU definition. “It’s absolutely fantastic news,” said Prof Debbie Pain, an independent ecological toxicologist and honorary research fellow at the University of Cambridge who has studied the effects of lead shot for nearly 40 years. “Lead shot kills 1 million waterbirds each year, it contaminates the environment and it’s a cumulative poison, so the problem is getting worse and worse. “This ban is going to make a huge difference to the health of wetlands and the health of waterbirds across the EU. It’s absolutely the right thing to do and non-toxic alternatives have been available for a long time.” Although Denmark outlawed lead shot in 1996, most other EU nations continue to use it. In Britain, a coalition of shooting groups earlier this year pledged to move to non-toxic alternatives within the next five years. Waitrose has banned the sale of game shot with lead. In England, the use of lead shot is banned for the shooting of all ducks and geese and on foreshores and other sensitive sites, but campaigners say compliance is poor. Research has found that more than 70% of ducks are still shot with lead. If the ban does not come into force before the Brexit transition period ends, Britain will not be compelled to adopt it, but government sources say it supports the principle of addressing the impact of lead shot. Countries will have 24 months to bring in the ban, which will result in shooters only being able to use non-toxic steel ammunition across vast swathes of northern European countries, where a lot of land meets the EU definition of wetland. The European Chemicals Agency is now developing restrictions on the use of all lead ammunition and the use of lead in fishing weights in preparation for a full ban on lead ammunition. Ruth Cromie of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust said lead poisoning caused lowered immune systems in wild birds, potentially facilitating the spread of diseases such as avian flu. “Progressive hunters have known for a long time that lead ammunition has to go. This is a clear sign that the policy is finally catching up with this no-brainer. We’ve got all the evidence and we’ve got a practical solution – non-toxic ammunition.”"
"Romania has been accused of “complete silence” over its investigation into the sinking of the Queen Hind last November, which resulted in the deaths of more than 14,000 sheep. Rescuers who rushed to the sinking Queen Hind vessel, which left Romania’s Black Sea port of Midia a year ago, managed to save just 228 sheep out of a total 14,600, but only 180 ultimately survived the ordeal.Romania’s prime minister Ludovic Orban vowed on television last year to end live exports in the “medium-term”. However, since the Queen Hind disaster more than 2 million live animals have been exported from Romania – mostly to north Africa and the Middle East. Romanian authorities have claimed the vessel was 10% below capacity and that the animals were “clinically healthy and fit for transport”. But campaigners say the vessel was overloaded and this ultimately led to the thousands of sheep drowning in the Black Sea.The only information to emerge since the sinking has been the discovery of secret compartments onboard with dead animals inside, by the company hired to remove the ship from the water.Romania’s transport ministry told the Guardian this week that investigations are concluded and said a summary of the report will be published on the ministry’s website. They also said that the purpose of the technical investigation was to establish maritime safety issues and to prevent future accidents, and “not to establish guilt in people involved”.EU law stipulates that investigations into maritime accidents should be reported in full within 12 months, but that if a final report is not possible in that timeframe, then “an interim report shall be published within 12 months of the date” of the event. “They promised a cross-check investigation to find out what happened, and since then – complete silence,” said Gabriel Paun, EU director at Animals International. The Guardian contacted MGM Marine Shipping, the management company behind the Queen Hind, and they denied any knowledge of secret decks. They said company procedures hadn’t changed since the disaster. “Nothing has changed, I don’t want to talk any more about this vessel – I want to forget about it,” a company representative said in a telephone call before hanging up.A European commission audit on Romania between September and October last year, which aimed to evaluate animal welfare during transport by livestock vessels to non-EU countries, raised multiple concerns, including “a general lack of records in the system of controls to ensure animal welfare during transport by sea to non-EU countries”. “There is no evidence of checks confirming that the animals are fit to continue the journey. The absence of documented procedures, records and support to official veterinarians in checking vessels provide little assurances on the effectiveness of most controls carried out,” the report said.“The Queen Hind was an iconic example of the intrinsic failures of the system,” said Reineke Hameleers, CEO of Brussels-based Eurogroup for Animals, an EU umbrella group for animal advocacy organisations. “The EU likes to pride itself as a global animal welfare leader, but it still makes its hands dirty with this cruel industry.” A Guardian investigation found that livestock vessels are twice as likely to suffer a “total loss” from sinking or grounding as standard cargo vessels. Livestock ships are often old and originally built for other purposes before being converted to carry animals. The Queen Hind was 39 years old at the time of the disaster. Mary Pana, president of the association of cattle, sheep and pig breeders and exporters in Romania, said: “EU competition with Australia and New Zealand is acute.”“Naval accidents have happened to us and to them. But these are accidents … I trust the EC [European commission] will find an efficient way to change the current legislation so that the animals have superior welfare conditions for breeding, transport, and slaughter,” Pana said.Campaigners have complained that since the disaster little has changed to improve animal welfare standards for live exports. “These are not five-star cruises,” said Paun. “I’ve spent time on cargo ships and conditions cannot be improved – there are always an enormous amount of problems that occur, and there is not one single [long-haul] shipment where there are no animals dying.” Vasile Deac, a veterinarian and owner of a live export company, said a ban on live exports would harm the livelihoods of Romanian farmers. “The live animal export trade is very important for Romanian farmers,” Deac said. “If there was no live export market farmers wouldn’t have anywhere to sell their animals and it would be a big loss for them.” “As an exporter it’s very important for me to see the ships that the animals are exported on,” he said. “The Queen Hind was an accident, it wasn’t done intentionally.”Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"The song of the black catbird – with its flute-like chirps and screeching single-note squalls – was once heard across Guatemala, Belize and southern Mexico until large-scale farms began to destroy its habitat. Now, thanks to a collective of musicians, producers and DJs, the tiny bird’s song – and that of nine other endangered species from the region – could be heard on dancefloors around the world, with proceeds going to conserving the endangered birds. A Guide to the Birdsong of Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean is a 10-track record that samples recordings of endangered, vulnerable or near threatened birds from across the region, with each track composed by artists from the same country. “The main impulse here is conservation but of course there’s an artistic challenge too,” said Robin Perkins, 33, a record producer from Manchester who leads the project. The black catbird’s song was worked on by the Belizean group the Garifuna Collective, led by another keen birder-cum-musician, Al Ovando. “My concept was to pay homage to many of the birds that have disappeared and to call for these birds to be protected,” the 44-year-old songwriter said. “I wanted to honour the birds of Belize, and the black catbird has this amazing one-note call.” The record may pleasing to the ear, but its creators say it is also a call to arms. “This is an emblematic album for a bigger problem: we’ve just featured 10 species of birds, but it speaks to the destruction of the habitats, and that songs across South and Central America are disappearing,” said Perkins. The album, released via Perkins’ label Shika Shika, follows a 2015 record inspired by endangered birds in South America, which raised more than $15,000 for two bird conservation charities in the region. For that project, Colombian artist Alejandra Ortíz, 40, of the group Lulacruza, sampled the song of the critically endangered Niceforo’s wren. “Nature is always talking to us,” said Ortíz. “And when one birdsong gets quieter as one species disappears, it means that entire ecosystems are failing.” One in eight of the world’s bird species are threatened with 222 critically endangered, according to BirdLife International. Six of the birds featured on the album are considered to be endangered, while the other four – including the black catbird – are listed as vulnerable or near threatened. “It’d be a sad conclusion to reach, that these birdsongs could only be heard on recordings or vinyl and MP3, but we have enough time to act,” Perkins said. “We need activism coming from different places, and music is one of those places.”"
"With the title of England’s worst road pollution hotspot this week being placed on a small village on the Jurassic Coast, the problem of toxic NO2 fumes is in the spotlight – not just as a public hazard for big cities but for countryside residents too. And it’s expected to get worse. While Friends of the Earth this week revealed the latest figures showing 1,360 sites across England were breaching the air quality objective levels for NO2, road traffic forecasts from the Department of Transport show traffic volumes are expected to increase in England and Wales each year until 2050, potentially by up to 51% in total. Up to 80 % of this NO2 comes from exhaust fumes. Along with other traffic fumes, it is among the largest environmental risks to public health. Long-suffering residents of England’s worst hotspot, Chideock in Dorset, told the Guardian they are divided on how to fix their decades-long traffic blight. Like many rural communities, they feel cut off from mainline railways or adequate bus services and rely heavily on their cars. But millions of tourists and business visitors also snarl up Chideock and other coastal villages on the A35. Only 550 people live here but it is the main tourist access route to the Dorset coastline and has a popular beach less about a 1.5km walk away. As a result, in summer 20,000 vehicles a day rattle through. The A35 turns an otherwise rural retreat into an urban rattle and hum. A constant stream of cars, vans and lorries rumbles past lines of immaculately thatched cottages, two pubs and a village shop, the vehicles spewing out harmful levels of this poison. The residents tell me most of the listed buildings are too old to have proper foundations and are being shaken. The village bus stop sits in the natural cradle of the landscape basin and pollution flows down the road and collects here. One resident said her asthma was made worse when she regularly used the bus stop, so she stopped.  Resident Mansel Jones said: “A small number of people who live on the road are pushing to get a village bypass but it would destroy our village and just move the problem over into the fields nearby. Why destroy another beautiful piece of countryside? Once the bypass is built they can sell their houses for more. If you don’t like a busy road why buy a house on one? Anna Dunn runs a B&B in a 15th century house on the main road but only achieves about 30% occupancy. She has given up trying to run a full hotel: “People would come to stay but leave because of the road noise,” she said. Another resident, Sue Griffin, said: “As a newcomer from busy London, I was amazed and then appalled at the traffic thundering through Chideock. My cob cottage lost its flank wall before I bought it – it literally fell down. No wonder. The vibrations are continuous.” Tony Peacock, who is deputy chair of the parish council and member of a working group calling for a bypass, said: “The HGVs come down the hill almost all day. There is pollution from the tyres, brakes, exhausts – various metals, PM2.5 and other pollutants coming off them. The buses do not seem to be commercially viable. The last bus back from London leaves at around 12pm, so that’s no good.” Resident Michael Moles has run the local post office and village store for 13 years: “There was a vote and a majority of the village rejected the proposal for the bypass. I think it would be disastrous for me commercially and for the pubs, cut off parts of the village and distress people who would live on the bypass. Do we enjoy the heavy traffic? No. But it’s not 365 days of the year, it is only at the height of the season, it is part and parcel of Chideock. My hope is the introduction of more clean propulsion of cars will address the question.” The mixed attitudes show the challenges many villages face as they confront increasing traffic impacts on communities and health, balanced with economic and transport needs. Chideock’s parish council asked Highways England to “detrunk” the A35 – meaning it would no longer be designated as a main link road – on grounds of road safety, traffic vibration, air pollution, congestion and village severance. Highways England said it had to consider if a route “fits with the intention for a strategic road network to link main centres of population, major ports, airports and stations, peripheral areas and provide key cross-border routes to Scotland and Wales”. The strategic and planning executive director, Elliot Shaw, told the council: “We work hard to mitigate those impacts through our management of the routes and in any enhancement schemes. Alongside this, we also need to balance the role that the strategic road network plays in providing accessibility across England and supporting long-distance travel and the economy.” West Dorset MP Chris Loder said the local traffic pollution problem had been overlooked for too long and he is reestablishing an A35 working group: “The British Lung Foundation have echoed to me the damaging effects of high levels of exhaust pollution and this must be a much higher priority in my opinion.” Simon Bowens, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, has proposed several alternatives to more road building. He said: “The government must end its damaging fixation on building more roads. You can’t justify this by planning to phase out polluting petrol and diesel vehicles and replace them with electric ones. “We need to go much further than just getting out of one type of car and into another. Investment in better cycling and walking should be part of a fair and green post-coronavirus economic recovery plan aimed at creating a cleaner, fairer future.”  This article was amended on 3 August 2020 to remove references to nitrogen dioxide being invisible and odourless.

"Usually, at this time of year, Corfu would have submitted to the soporific rhythms of the relentless summer heat. Instead, anger is in the air and battle lines have been drawn, none more so than in the minds of those determined to protect the island’s last piece of virgin territory – a place of unique biodiversity – from being developed into an “ultra luxury” resort. The stakes couldn’t be higher. On the one side are campaigners, most visibly Lee Durrell, widow of the British naturalist Gerald, whose portrayal of Corfu in My Family and Other Animals played no small part in evoking the Ionian isle’s charms and beauty – and ultimately bringing tourism to its shores. On the other are a business-friendly Greek government and the private equity fund NCH Capital, which acquired the natural paradise in north-eastern Corfu when Athens’ cash-strapped state was selling off assets at the height of the country’s debt crisis. Eight years on, after 11 court appeals, two presidential decrees, 10 ministerial decisions and 54 government interventions, the New-York based group has finally obtained the permits to move ahead with the flagship “Kassiopi project”. Barely a month after being officially inaugurated, contractors are being lined up. By 2026, the investment firm hopes to have transformed the headland, known as Erimitis, “the Hermit”, into a high-end “environmentally sensitive” resort with a five-star hotel, holiday villas and a 60-berth marina. Construction will be in accordance with bioclimatic design principles, says Andreas Santis, its managing director. “It will be very green. Only 7% of the entire 500-acre site will actually be built. In terms of building density that is much lower than any other area around here.” Durrell, a respected naturalist in her own right, is far from convinced. She recalls how, during Gerry’s last visit in 1986, there were already enough architectural “carbuncles” erected along Corfu’s shoreline to make him “turn his back to the coast” during boat trips. Erimitis is not only home to otters, seals, raptors and reptiles but, she enthuses, lakes, marshes and bright pebble beaches, orchids and strawberry trees, in an area that remains one of the least developed in the Mediterranean. “Any destruction of such an ecosystem would be unthinkable,” said the US-born author, speaking from the Venetian home she is renovating on Corfu. “I can understand the government’s argument for foreign investment, but Erimitis is a jewel of nature that must be saved.” When she is not in Corfu, Durrell runs the zoo established by her late husband on the Channel Island of Jersey. “Human beings have been taking over so much of the planet, and natural world, so unnecessarily and to our peril,” she said. “And what has it led to? Deforestation, climate change and pandemics. We should be learning from such lessons.” The naturalist is not alone in holding such views. The headland lies along a coastline jokingly referred to as Kensington-on-Sea after the wealthy London district that is home to many of its residents outside the summer period. Corfu’s lure for the super-rich – Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are regular visitors – has also played a role in mounting opposition to the project. As the rhetoric has intensified, billionaires with villas on the island have also weighed in on the side of the eclectic group of resident conservationists, anti-capitalists, leftists and environmentalists bent on stopping the development. In July, the financier Nathaniel Rothschild, a frequent visitor to his family’s estate in the area, tweeted that that the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, was “foolish” for endorsing the “Erimitis development fiasco” after the leader attended its ground-breaking ceremony. Johnny Cameron, who heads the Corfu Owners Association, which represents around 200 mostly British homeowners, appealed to Mitsotakis to reconsider and “realise the strength and righteousness of local opposition”. “We do not understand why a government that claims to support sustainable and environmentally friendly development would ever back such an old-fashioned project,” he wrote in the second of two letters to the centre-right leader. “Surely it is obvious that building in such a pristine area does not qualify as a model of sustainable development?” Santis rejects the complaints as disingenuous. Echoing Mitsotakis, he insists the project will provide much needed employment – boosting local finances by €180m over a decade at a time when the struggling Greek economy is poised to contract by a projected 10% as a result of the pandemic. “It will create 1,000 jobs during the construction phase and around 500 when it operates,” Santis said. “If all these people feel so strongly about it, why didn’t they bid for the land when it was put up for international tender? They certainly have the money. Their concern isn’t environmental but [motivated] more by personal interest. It’s a clear case of ‘not in my back yard’.” With construction work set to begin, activists say they will return to the courts to try to halt the €120m development. Street protests have been held and more are planned for when the bulldozers move in. If anything, say critics, the outbreak of coronavirus – and absence of visitors – has made it chillingly clear that, like so many parts of Greece, Corfu is overly dependent on tourism. Much of the island’s coast is now lined with rundown and eerily empty hotels: the price of mass tourism seemingly catering to another age. It’s not lost on opponents that the equity fund paid a paltry amount for the land. “In retrospect it’s a tragedy that some of the very wealthy people who live along this coastline didn’t form a consortium when the property was put up for sale,” lamented Richard Pine, a writer who directs the Durrell Library of Corfu. “They could have matched the absurdly low figure of €25m, which was all that the state received for selling it off. In place of the resort, they could have endowed a national park with an interpretive centre for schoolchildren to appreciate the ecosystem on their doorsteps.”"
"One in three children around the world have concentrations of lead in their blood at levels likely to cause significant long-term health damage, new research has found. About 800 million children and young people under the age of 19 are likely to have blood levels of lead at or above 5 micrograms per decilitre (5μg/dl), according to the report. There is no safe level for lead exposure, according to the World Health Organization, because even at very low concentrations it operates as a dangerous toxin, but levels above 5μg/dl are regarded by the US Centers for Disease Control as a cause for action. The findings, from research by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and published by Unicef on Thursday, highlight the ongoing dangers to children from lead, which has been phased out of common use in petrol, paints and water pipes over decades. “This is an absolutely shocking figure,” said Nicholas Rees, policy specialist at Unicef and author of the report. “We have known for so long about the toxic [nature of lead], but we have not known how widespread it is, and how many children are affected.” Lead is a potent neurotoxin and high exposure can kill, while lower levels cause symptoms ranging from pain, vomiting and seizures to developmental delay, mental difficulties and mood disorders. The lower levels can also cause children to be born prematurely. Exposure at the levels studied is likely to cause reductions in cognitive ability, higher levels of violence and longterm health impacts such as cardiovascular disease, according to the researchers. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure because it damages the developing brain and nervous system, building up over time, and the impacts do not show immediately. Lead mimics calcium in the bones, building up in people’s bodies and causing damage to other vital organs, including the kidneys, heart and lungs. Richard Fuller of Pure Earth, an NGO that collaborated with Unicef on the report, said people were less aware of the damage caused by lead, after campaigns to remove the toxin from many common uses in developed countries decades ago. “We did a terrific job of taking lead out of gasoline [petrol], but the use of lead has plateaued after falling in the 1970s and 80s,” he said. Lead at 5μg/dl of blood is likely to wipe about 3-5 points from a child’s IQ score, and at the levels found in the Unicef report could double the level of violence in society, said Fuller. It is also likely to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, as about 900,000 deaths a year are already linked to lead poisoning. Fuller said that while the levels of lead might seem small, across populations the damage was significant. “It means double the number of people who are intellectually impaired,” he said. “It is definitely not a trivial issue.” He said about 30 academic studies had linked elevated lead levels to people’s propensity for violent behaviour, providing enough corroboration for scientists to make a strong association between continuing lead contamination and its likely impacts on violence. Scientists know more about the damage lead causes even at small concentrations than they did previously. Until recently, the US judged that levels above 10μg/dl were a cause for concern, but changed this to 5μg/dl in 2012 as more evidence became available. One of the leading causes of lead poisoning is the disposal of car batteries, which use lead and acid to generate an electrical charge, and make up 85% of the lead used globally. When disposed of safely, they pose little risk, but in many countries about half of car batteries are recycled without safety precautions. When this happens, large quantities of lead and lead compounds are spilled, poisoning people who come into contact with the liquid and solid products, and contaminating the soil for years. A further cause of lead poisoning is the use of lead compounds, such as lead oxide and lead chromate, as a food additive to make spices appear more vivid in colour. The compounds are used to make turmeric appear bright yellow, and sometimes used with paprika. The report found examples of its use in India, Bangladesh, Georgia, the Balkans, north Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. Children in developed countries are also at risk, from sources including old water pipes, lead paint and contaminated soil. In the US, children living in poorer households and dilapidated accommodation have been found to be at higher risk. In the UK, about 200,000 children are likely to be affected, according to Unicef. The UK decided in 2018 against conducting nationwide screening of lead levels, making it hard to judge where children and adults are most at risk, and the UK still only regards levels over 10μg/dl in children and pregnant women as being of concern, though that may change later this year. Privatised water companies can replace lead pipes without charge, but there is no obligation on them to find out whether people are still being served from lead pipes, leaving many people unaware of the problem. Homeowners must pay for replacing pipes on their own property, which may be beyond the reach of some people, and landlords are not obliged to do the same for tenants. Ovnair Sepai, principal toxicologist at Public Health England, said: “The estimate in this report has been calculated based on data from other countries, which means it is unlikely to accurately reflect blood levels in the UK. “The UK has strict regulations in place for lead in food, water, cosmetics, toys, spices and industry. Lead exposure in children has dropped dramatically in the UK since it was banned in paint and petrol, but risks remain, which may disproportionately affect children in deprived areas.”"
"Rub a walnut leaf between your fingers and it releases an exquisite perfume. Some say the smell is reminiscent of furniture polish, but I think it’s woodier, a pure essence of tree. The scent comes from an aromatic chemical called juglone, which is unique to walnut trees. While the ancient Greeks thought the wrinkled nuts looked like brains and called them karyon or heads, the Romans had a lower body part in mind. They dedicated the tree to Jupiter and named its produce “glands of Jupiter”, shortened to juglans; literally “Jupiter’s nuts”. At this time of year the developing seeds are still soft and white, encased in skins speckled with cream dots and lightly furred with tiny hairs. They often form bulging, egg-shaped pairs, fixed to twig ends. It was the Romans who brought the English walnut (Juglans regia) – a species that actually originated in Persia – to Britain, and in 1629, the plant collector John Tradescant the Younger brought the black walnut (J nigra) here from north America. Swirl-grained walnut wood became fashionable for furniture making and musket stocks in the 1600s, and both species were planted widely in the centuries that followed. They were a valuable community resource – the nuts came to symbolise riches and were used as charms to increase wealth. Because their roots secrete juglone, which can stunt crops, they were grown in uncultivated ground along road verges and on village greens, and the tradition of wayside walnuts still flourishes in Porlock Vale. Seven English walnuts of various ages grow on Bossington Green beside Horner Water. One looks as if it is dancing, leaning back on its swollen, silvery bole, flinging its arms up, green hair streaming. The village was once renowned for the Bossington Walnut, a gigantic veteran tree whose vast canopy overshadowed the road. It was probably planted in the 17th century, at about the same time a neighbouring cottage was built. Perhaps the tree was intended to bring prosperity to the house. It certainly attracted attention – it was one of the wonders of Somerset, which people travelled miles to admire until it was felled in the 1950s."
"Kenya’s oldest national park, which is facing threats from habitat loss, a decline in wildlife species and government infrastructure developments, is at the centre of a fresh row over its future. Created through a colonial proclamation in December 1946, the 45-square mile Nairobi national park is the only sanctuary in the world where wild animals roam freely next to a bustling metropolis. Its ecological health is indicative of the country’s efforts to preserve Africa’s vanishing wildlife. Conservationists, however, fear the park is fast losing its place as a critical habitat for wildlife, with some species recording a 70% decline within the past 40 years, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which manages the country’s national parks. A 30,000-strong wildebeest migration that used to happen during the 60s has collapsed, with only about 200 left in the park, while the population of Burchell’s zebra dropped from 1,400 to under 800 between 2010 and 2019. The park is also home to about 100 Masai giraffes, currently on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list of threatened species. Pressure to expand the country’s infrastructure has created a conflict between conservation and socioeconomic interests. In the past eight years, KWS has bowed to pressure from other government departments and allowed Chinese firms to construct a new highway and a railway line through the park. A report in 2015 described the park’s deterioration in the face of human activities as “hazardous to the preservation of wildlife in the area” and outlined the threats posed by alien and invasive species that stifle the regenerative capacity of indigenous species and reduce forage resources for wild animals. Last year, the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International reported that invasive species were “a serious and growing problem” across Kenya. However, loss of wildlife dispersal area is perhaps the greatest threat to the park’s survival. Communities living on the park’s southern edge are tempted by high prices to sell of parts of their once large and open tracts of land for housebuilding. “It is true the park is under immense pressure,” said Dr Patrick Omondi, director of biodiversity, research and planning at KWS. “Land prices around the park’s dispersal area continue to skyrocket. Unfortunately, the land is being sold to outsiders who have little interest in conservation.” Faced with dwindling wildlife and visitor numbers, and increasing industry and human settlements on all sides, KWS has drawn up a 10-year management plan it hopes will save the park from total collapse. But the plan has opened up a new battleground between wildlife authorities and conservation groups, with the latter accusing the government of failing to adequately consult with communities living on land adjacent to the park. The plan includes a proposal to build fences around huge tracts of land on the southern edge of the park. Currently, the park is fenced only to the east, north and west – where it directly borders densely populated city suburbs. The government hopes the extended fencing will keep dangerous animals out of such areas, reduce escalating human-wildlife conflict and cut down on compensation claims. In June, however,the largely Maasai community residing to the south of the park met with representatives from several wildlife conservation agencies, to call for the fencing option to be shelved. They argue the new fences will block the last migration route for animals in the park. William Ole Kompe, a 60-year-old Maasai elder whose land is within the conservancy that borders the park, told the meeting he opposed any move that would separate his community from the animals within the Nairobi ecosystem. “There will be no fencing on our side,” he told the small gathering through an interpreter. “If that happens, I will lead a street demonstration to oppose the move. We have lived together with wild animals forever. Why separate us now?” Nkamunu Patita, programme coordinator at the Wildlife Foundation, argues that the dispersal area could still be saved with proper incentives to landowners.  “The government has known about the problem with the dispersal area for the past 40 years,” she said. “They could have bought the land adjacent to the park when it was cheap and kept it open. If that was not possible, they could have shared the proceeds from the park with the community so that they do not sell the land to outsiders.” Patita was born and brought up in the area when wildlife was abundant. Before 1946, the land where the park lies was grazing ground for the local Maasai community. The name Nairobi is Maasai for a “place of cool waters”, while many other spots within the park have retained their Maasai names. “Our way of life has always been in tandem with wildlife conservation. If they [KWS] fence in or out part of this community, who will look after the wild animals outside the core conservation area? The Mbagathi River forms the boundary between the community and the park. If the river is fenced in, the community will be unable to make use of the water, while fencing it out means the water will not be accessible to animals within the park. We need more consultations before the final implementation of the plan,” she said. Dr Paula Kahumbu, chief executive officer at Wildlife Direct, said the reason why Kenya still has free-roaming wildlife is due to the retention of migratory corridors. In Botswana, where fences were put up to keep wild animals from spreading diseases to livestock reared for beef production, wild animals trying to migrate in search of water have died, some after becoming entangled in the fence. “Wild animals follow the rain patterns. When there are rains in the dispersal areas, they will move out of the park and return during the dry season,” she said. “Kenya needs a diverse habitat since research shows some species like rhinos cannot breed properly in a concentrated place. If we close animals in, only a few species will flourish while others, such as the eastern bearded wildebeests that move in and out of the park, may become extinct.” Omondi has sought to reassure conservationists, arguing that the management plan is a “living” document and a guide during the implementation phase of the final proposals. “The draft says fencing will be gradual and, in any case, that will not be done until an ecological study is done to show that the remaining parcels of land are compatible with long-term wildlife conservation,” he said. “In fact, it is only through the community that we can win a place for wildlife in Kenya and it is in our interest that community land be compatible with wildlife conservation.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"In the north-east corner of Oregon there is a traffic jam of weathered pickups and horse trailers on the Zumwalt Road. Redwing blackbirds trill over the bellowing of hundreds of cattle clustered by corrals, the sign of a spring branding in progress. Half a dozen cowgirls and cowboys on horseback circle the herd, lassoing calves for brands, vaccinations and, for the steers, castration. The smell of singed hair hangs in the warm air. Standing in the centre of the scrum is Dan Probert, owner of Lightning Creek Ranch. Probert, 56, smiles as he watches the roping teams deftly manoeuvre his animals. After branding, Probert’s Angus cross herd will be turned out on Lightning Creek’s pastures as part of an ambitious partnership with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) designed to protect the Zumwalt prairie, the largest surviving native bunchgrass prairie in North America. The high, rolling Zumwalt, which stretches 500 square miles (1,295 sq km) between the glaciated Wallowa Mountains and the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, is gouged by rivers that plunge into Hells Canyon, forming Oregon’s border with Idaho. This diverse ecosystem supports key populations of raptors, songbirds, bees, butterflies and rare native plants, along with elk herds and other wildlife. TNC estimates that over the past 150 years as much as half of all US grasslands may have been lost, mainly to farming and real-estate development. With just 313m hectares (775m acres) of public and private rangeland left, much of it in the west, conserving this unprotected tract of the privately-owned Zumwalt is a priority for the conservancy. In 2000, TNC established the Zumwalt Prairie Preserve with the goal of protecting the rich biodiversity within its 51-square-mile sanctuary. But TNC lands comprise just one-tenth of the Zumwalt prairie, which has been prized grazing land for generations of local ranching families. Over the past decade, the nonprofit has cultivated relationships with a dozen landowners who raise cattle in an effort to promote sustainable grazing practices throughout the entire Zumwalt. Cattlemen and conservationists are not natural allies. Ranchers use the land to earn a living, often claiming to be conscientious stewards. But a long history of overgrazing has degraded the soil, fouled waterways and destroyed plant and wildlife habitat. In this remote corner of Oregon, tensions between conservationists and ranchers flare up over the presence of grey wolves, for instance, and a flowering plant called Spalding’s catchfly, which is on the US endangered species list. Initially, the local ranching community was wary of TNC’s involvement with the Zumwalt; some worried the organisation had an “anti-grazing” agenda. Meanwhile, some of TNC’s donors and staff didn’t think cattle had any place on Oregon’s largest private nature preserve. TNC is attempting to bridge this divide by using science to demonstrate that the goals of livestock producers and conservationists can coexist – and make the entire Zumwalt ecosystem healthier in the process. The partnership with Probert and other ranchers is integral to discovering the right balance of practices and to answer questions such as how many cows on a pasture, at what time of year and for how long, so that both ranchers and the prairie prosper. As the first rancher outside the preserve to sign up long term to the project, Probert is the linchpin. “If I can’t make a living, the whole thing falls apart,” he says. Jeff Fields stands on a ridge overlooking the prairie on a bright June day. The carpet of spring-green grasses and wildflowers looks timeless and wild. But Fields, a biologist who manages the Zumwalt Prairie Preserve, is quick to correct that perception. “It’s been a grazed landscape for a very, very long time,” he says. He points to clumps of bunchgrass interspersed with geraniums, cinquefoils, lichen, and patches of bare soil. These plant communities, he explains, are dependent on “ecological disturbance” to stimulate regrowth year after year. Throughout history, herbivores – from early antelope to the Nez Perce horse and cattle herds – have browsed the prairie’s bunchgrass, providing that crucial disturbance. “The prairie evolved with herbivory,” Fields says. Managed grazing is an attempt to replicate that historical relationship using commercial livestock. It has become a central piece of regenerative agriculture, an umbrella term for a range of farming and ranching practices that capture sunlight and carbon dioxide to stimulate plant growth, boost organic matter in soil, and foster greater biodiversity both above ground and below. As cows graze, they aerate the soil with their hooves and trample plants and other organic matter – including their droppings – into the soil. This stimulates growth, enriches the soil, increases water flow, and creates habitat, with knock-on benefits up and down the ecological chain. Some longtime ranchers here insist the Zumwalt prairie was healthy before TNC got involved. But there had never been a rigorous assessment of its condition. From 2005–2009, TNC collaborated with Oregon State University and the University of Idaho to assess the impact of low-, medium-, and high-intensity grazing as measured against land that wasn’t grazed at all. By varying the stocking rate – the number of animals multiplied by the amount of time they spent on each 40-hectare pasture – researchers were able to analyse how different grazing strategies affected everything from soil compaction and vegetation to songbirds and pollinators. The results were mixed. Songbird nesting did not change significantly across the test plots with low to moderate grazing, for instance, but Savannah sparrows and grasshopper sparrows avoided the most intensively grazed areas. And while a higher level of grazing decreased bumblebee populations, it may have provided better nesting conditions for digger bees. Instead of blanket conclusions, the data provided fodder for years of collaborative studies and shaped TNC’s Zumwalt grazing research programme. Without an economic motive, the nonprofit can afford to limit grazing to meet conservation goals. Livestock are restricted to about half of the 13,350-hectare property and excluded from more than 400 hectares, including sensitive areas around streams. The five ranching families who lease TNC pastures adhere to a strict schedule of short-duration grazing lasting anywhere from one to 20 days. The limited grazing programme Fields oversees functions as something of a control group for the experiment with Probert. But he acknowledges that their data collection tools provide only snapshots of individual plots at a moment in time, making it difficult to generalise across a grassland as vast and diverse as the Zumwalt. “It’s all a big mush of diversity,” Fields says. One possible solution is a satellite research project underway with the University of Idaho, called RangeSat. TNC fits some of the cattle with radio collars to collect data about ground cover and grazing patterns. Over time, it will improve the computer biomass model of the Zumwalt, providing a big-picture view for ecologists and ranchers to make better land management decisions. “This is a big deal,” says Fields. Probert grew up on a ranch in nearby Enterprise, but left home after high school and spent the next 30 years on ranches in California and Oregon. “The day I left I wanted to come back,” he says. He was living in south-east Oregon when he heard that Lightning Creek Ranch, a 5,000-hectare property in the Zumwalt, was for sale. He coveted the property, but says he “couldn’t swing the price tag”. So he struck a deal with TNC in which the nonprofit helped Probert finance the ranch, and in exchange he promised not to plough, subdivide, mine or erect wind towers on the land in perpetuity. The contract, called a “conservation easement”, is becoming increasingly popular in the west as a way to protect open lands against the incursion of real estate developers. Probert took over Lightning Creek Ranch in 2014, and then spent three years hammering out a grazing management plan with TNC. “The big things were easy to agree on,” Probert says, but the parties struggled with the set of conservation goals encompassing the health of creeks, pastures, plants and wildlife, with routine monitoring and annual evaluations conducted in cooperation with TNC. Now in its fifth year, this “living document” is up for review before the end of the year. Since 1985, Probert has been a follower of “holistic management”. Popularised by the wildlife biologist Allan Savory, it is based on the controversial theory that intensive grazing followed by a long recovery, called “rest”, is the best way to maintain vigorous grasslands – effectively the opposite of what Fields is doing on TNC land. Savory’s critics contend that these methods are not supported by science and have been used as justification for putting more cattle on the land. Probert, though, sees it as a useful framework for trial and error, a way to constantly check and adjust his decision-making. After years of managing other ranches, Lightning Creek is his first opportunity to put holistic management fully into practice. Two weeks after branding, Probert visits his pastures that line the Zumwalt Road; they are tall and thick from spring rains. Movable fencing divides one large pasture into 80-hectare paddocks, and the cattle are moved between paddocks every few days. Probert’s agreement with TNC doesn’t dictate how many cattle he puts into a pasture, or how long he leaves them there. “We think we are still pretty darn independent,” Probert says. Instead, the grazing plan is built on specific objectives for stream channels and riparian areas, soil and plant composition, native wildlife and plant habitat, and invasive weed management, as well as Probert’s cattle production. TNC’s rangeland ecologist routinely evaluates Lightning Creek’s pastures using monitoring tools, or indicators. One measures how much of the standing plants the cattle have eaten, for instance, while another assesses the “grazing response index”, based on grazing intensity, seasonality, and allotted recovery time. Probert’s pastures have consistently achieved good ratings over the past four years, according to Fields. But with so much complexity, it’s hard to generalise at this stage of the project. Fields notes, for example, that creek recovery on Lightning Creek Ranch is progressing slower than on TNC’s lands. Probert drives his pickup into a pasture where 1,300 cattle have just grazed for three days. The grasses are trampled and unevenly munched, the wildflower blossoms stripped. It is a dramatic contrast to the lightly grazed, blooming pastures on the TNC preserve. Probert is pleased. “Some people may say it looks bad,” he says. “It isn’t bad.” In the ideal world of holistic management, every plant gets grazed once. TNC’s more conservative approach means that many plants don’t have that bite taken out of them so that they retain biomass and generate better root systems. Probert considers this management practice, called “over-resting”, detrimental. He points to the green stubble of a munched plant. “This one is doing its job, turning carbon dioxide and water into new green leaves that support wildlife or livestock.” Every spring Probert defers grazing on some pastures to protect nesting songbirds, and he manages his cattle to prevent browsing on trees that provide habitats for raptors and elk calves. The recently grazed pasture will be rested for a full year, minimum, until the grasses are waist-high again. “We’re seeing rapid changes in terms of soil health, water infiltration and health of plants,” Probert says. So far, it is working for him financially, too. Each year he has been able to raise more animals on the same amount of ground. Four years ago, he was running 900 cattle on pastures where he now runs 1,100. “At the end of the day, we’re turning more sunlight into more growing plants, and then we’re putting those plants through an animal that we hope makes us a saleable product,” he says. Fields does not subscribe to Savory’s intensive grazing model, or even agree with Probert’s contention that livestock grazing is essential to maintaining the health of the Zumwalt. “I don’t think we need livestock grazing to make a healthy grassland,” he says, mentioning the abundant deer, elk and ground squirrels that also graze the prairie. For their part, local landholders don’t think the longevity of these grasslands depends on TNC’s efforts either. “People have always thought the Zumwalt was worth preserving,” is how one rancher put it. But both groups have invested in a partnership staked on continuous improvement for the long haul. And despite the fact that they don’t always speak the same language, Probert says “TNC is a good neighbour”, which is a high compliment in these parts. Fields says of Probert: “The most valuable asset we have is an educated, curious and consistent observer who is willing to change his behaviour based on what he observes.” When the two meet in the autumn to review Probert’s grazing management plan, neither anticipates big changes. As the project evolves, the goal is to continue gathering evidence for a variety of practices to support sustainable grazing – Probert’s, TNC’s, something in between – that make sense on the Zumwalt. “From a scientific lens we’d be foolish to think we can reduce it to a simple, ‘Do this, don’t do that’,” says Fields, but “if we have different grazing systems and monitor consistently, we’re going to get a richer answer.”  This article was produced in collaboration with the Food & Environment Reporting Network, a nonprofit news organisation Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"The world’s largest nuclear fusion project began its five-year assembly phase on Tuesday in southern France, with the first ultra-hot plasma expected to be generated in late 2025. The €20bn (£18.2bn) Iter project will replicate the reactions that power the sun and is intended to demonstrate fusion power can be generated on a commercial scale. Nuclear fusion promises clean, unlimited power but, despite 60 years of research, it has yet to overcome the technical challenges of harnessing such extreme amounts of energy. Millions of components will be used to assemble the giant reactor, which will weigh 23,000 tonnes and the project is the most complex engineering endeavour in history. Almost 3,000 tonnes of superconducting magnets, some heavier than a jumbo jet, will be connected by 200km of superconducting cables, all kept at -269C by the world’s largest cryogenic plant. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, launched the assembly phase, alongside senior figures from Iter members, the EU, UK, China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the US. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said: “I believe disruptive innovation will play a key role in addressing global issues including climate change and realising a sustainable carbon-free society.” “Enabling the exclusive use of clean energy will be a miracle for our planet,” said Bernard Bigot, Iter director-general. He said fusion, alongside renewable energy, would allow transport, buildings and industry to run on electricity. But Bigot said: “Constructing the machine piece-by-piece will be like assembling a three-dimensional puzzle on an intricate timeline [and] with the precision of a Swiss watch.” The Iter project was conceived in 1985 but has suffered delays. Nuclear fusion releases vast amounts of energy when heavy hydrogen atoms fuse together, but this requires a temperature of 150m C, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. The hydrogen fuel is obtained from seawater and just a few grammes is needed but huge magnets are needed to contain the plasma in doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber known as a tokamak. Like conventional nuclear fission reactors, the process itself does not produce climate-warming carbon dioxide but fusion reactors cannot meltdown and produce much less radioactive waste. The Iter project will be the first to achieve a “burning” or self-heating plasma and is expected to generate 10 times more heat than is put in, far more than any previous attempt. It will also use a significant amount of electrical energy when it is running, to power the magnets and scientific instruments, But it is intended to be a proof-of-concept of large-scale fusion, not a design for a future commercial reactor. Among the components being assembled is the 30-metre-diameter cryostat, manufactured by India, which surrounds the reactor and keeps it at the extremely low temperature required. One of the electromagnets, called the central solenoid and built by the US, will have the magnetic power to lift an aircraft carrier. There are numerous private-sector companies pursuing nuclear fusion via much smaller devices, including Tokamak Energy, based in the UK and which has raised £117m in investment. Its executive vice-chairman, David Kingham, said: “We welcome the progress at Iter which we see as a great scientific project and a major endorsement of tokamak devices.” “But we are convinced that faster progress is possible, driven by the need for more carbon-free energy and enabled by private investment, modular designs, new materials and advanced technologies,” he said. Iter engineers said their giant project is the size that proven technologies can deliver.

"A century ago, Americans would not recognise our modern hunger for chicken. The year-long market for tender but relatively bland chicken meat is a newish phenomenon, and without it the idea of chicken cutlets, $5 rotisseries, or the McNugget would be a fantasy. How did America go from thinking of chicken as an “alternative” meat to consuming it more than any other meat? The story starts with corn. At the turn of the 20th century, chicken was almost always eaten in the spring. The priority for chicken raisers at the time was egg production, so after the eggs hatched, all the male birds would be fed up and then quickly harvested as “spring chickens” – young, tender birds that were sold whole for roasting or broiling (hence the term “broilers”). Outside the spring rush, you might be buying a bigger, fatter fryer or an old hen for stewing. “Farmers were sending chickens of all sorts of ages, different feather colours, and tremendous variety to the marketplace in the early 20th century,” says Roger Horowitz, food historian and author of Putting Meat on the American Table. But almost all chickens in the market were simply surplus to egg production, making them relatively uncommon – even rare. Tender spring chickens in particular could fetch a good price. But it is worth noting, Horowitz says, that the higher price wasn’t necessarily coming from pent-up demand. “It’s not as if consumers were clamoring for broilers,” he says. Though there was some consumer demand for chickens, the relatively high price for broilers likely had more to do with the limited, seasonal supply than a passion for poultry. During the second world war, however, red meat was rationed, and a national campaign encouraged the consumption of poultry and fish to save “meat” (beef, pork and lamb) for “the army and our allies”. Eating chicken became more common, but the preference for young broilers, and white breast meat, persisted. As the war drew to a close, feed millers, which buy and grind corn and other grains to feed livestock, saw a big opportunity to spur that demand for meat chickens, which consume large amounts of corn. When traditional banks refused to finance new-fangled “chicken farms”, the feed companies themselves offered farmers loans to buy feed and equipment, putting the pieces of the modern contract poultry system in place. Consumer acceptance of broilers out of season was not automatic. In the 1930s, the average American ate 10lbs (4.5kg) or less of chicken annually; by 2017 that had risen to 64lbs (29kg), according to the Economic Research Service at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). For decades chicken battled to be seen as a “meat”, and did not surpass its most expensive competitor, beef, in terms of overall consumption until 2010. A strong USDA-funded marketing campaign helped out. “In the 50s and 60s, you see where these agricultural extension operations start pushing out recipes very aggressively about broilers,” Horowitz says, and as feed companies and hatcheries (most of which would eventually become so-called “integrators”, which own several of the businesses involved in chicken production) continued to consolidate the industry, they were able to more carefully calibrate the chicken itself to what would sell most profitably, focusing on lowering costs and raising proportions of the highest-demand cuts, namely breast meat. Don Tyson, the late president of Tyson Foods, famously said: “If breast meat is worth two dollars a pound and dark meat is worth one dollar, which would I rather have?” But for generations, the idea of buying just the most coveted cuts of chicken was foreign to most consumers. It wasn’t until the 1980s that preferences began to switch to cuts of meat over the whole bird. These companies owned and understood their chickens from egg to table and were able to exert unprecedented control over the biology of their flocks. Now, not only are they able to fine tune the birds’ characteristics with incredible accuracy, they can also map interactions with feed, environment, and processing to maximise profits. For integrators and corn farmers alike, the investment paid off. In 2019, 9.2 billion 6lb (2.7kg) broiler chickens were harvested in the US, consuming about 1.8lbs (820g) of grain for every pound of chicken. But the impact on chickens from the changes in production is troubling. Over the past 70 years, the poultry industry has measured its success in terms of how many pounds of meat a chicken can produce for a given amount of feed. Modern chickens are more efficient than ever, with producers able to calculate to the ounce how much “input” of food, water, air and time are required to get a set amount of white and dark meat. The modern chicken is fully industrialised.With more than 500 chicken breeds existing on Earth, it might surprise you to learn that every nugget, breast, and cup of chicken noodle soup you’ve ever eaten likely came from one breed, a specialised cross between a Cornish and a white rock. The genetic lineages of chickens grown by the world’s biggest poultry companies are a closely guarded secret. But one common commercial line, the Cobb 500, originated from a contest held by the USDA’s Agricultural Extension Service in the 1940s, aptly titled the “chicken of tomorrow” competition. The winner, the Vantress chicken, would become the standard meat chicken by the 1950s. This chicken and its many descendants were optimised for a few key factors: large breasts, white feathers, fast and efficient growth, consistent sizes and gentle dispositions. The average size of a grocery store chicken in the 1920s was about 2.5lbs (1.13kg). Today it hovers around 6lbs (2.7 kg), which a broiler chicken can reach in about 47 days, according to the National Chicken Council (even younger, smaller birds are used for fast food restaurants). The use of naturally double-breasted breeds and millions of dollars in research has produced birds with massive breasts, but gaining that muscle mass quickly requires near constant food consumption, and leads the birds to have much lower activity levels. Growing pains lead to sedentary birds. “They actually have robots on wheels that go around the [poultry] house and inspect the birds with a camera and force the birds to move so that they walk more,” says Phillip Clauer, associate teaching professor at Penn State Extension. White feathers are key for marketing, because pin feathers and follicles of birds with coloured feathers can hang on to pigmentation, and coloured bird carcasses don’t appear as “clean” or sell as well to picky consumers. Consistent sizing is required to ensure that slaughterhouse line speeds can stay high. Processing chickens is one of the biggest bottlenecks in getting chickens from farms to grocery stores, and consistently sized birds keep the machines running smoothly. Gentle dispositions are also a must as chickens are naturally aggressive and even cannibalistic, especially in confined spaces and large numbers. Poultry houses are more profitable the more birds are inside, so reducing the chickens’ natural disposition to fight and eat one another is key to facilitating modern poultry rearing. Faster-maturing birds also tend to be gentler, because aggressive behavior is more common among sexually mature chickens, a milestone most broilers never reach. With limited diets, these industrial birds can live semi-normal lifespans, but if allowed to eat continuously, as they are genetically designed to, they tend to have extremely high mortality rates beyond the ideal harvest date.  Counterintuitively perhaps, the industrialisation of chicken led to far fewer choices when buying poultry. “If you look at cookbooks in the 20s and 30s – for a certain kind of dish you get a fat chicken, for another you get a fryer or broiler. And the marketplace distinguished between those kinds of chickens,” Horowitz says. The industry’s obsession with perfecting the broiler machine came at the cost of the consumer’s ability to choose other varieties of chicken. As chickens became more commonplace in grocery stores, brands started to reintroduce variety by offering individual cuts, skinless and boneless meats, and processed products (which also allowed them to improve the flavour, which had become decidedly bland over time). But as consumers’ interests trend away from more highly processed foods in search of story and connection to place, a niche may be opening for birds other than the Cornish cross. Growing food movements around the world are already spurring conversations about the possibility of making slower-growing chickens of different breeds, harvested at a larger variety of ages, more widely available. Even the company that grows Cobb 500 chicks is offering a new “rustic” variety with golden plumage, rather than the standard white. The conventional poultry industry may actually be poised to lead this trend, as it currently makes chickens of various sizes and ages available to institutional customers (fast food fried chicken, for example, is usually made from smaller, younger birds than are available in the grocery store). In the meantime, breeders and geneticists at the world’s largest poultry companies will continue refining their lines of Cornish cross broilers, in particular to grow quickly in harsh environments or on lower-quality feeds, conditions that might be more common in the developing world. “Instead of just selecting birds for maximum growth and size,” says Clauer, “now the genetic companies can look at 20, 30, 40 parameters and look very closely at the bird’s anatomy, health, structure, all the things that go into a modern bird that makes it much more efficient and have better liveability.” Though competition will likely come as technologies around lab-cultured and cell-based meats continue to progress and gain consumer acceptance, the sheer efficiency and short growth time of chickens is insulating the industry for now.Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a round-up of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"A British fracking company has vowed to challenge the effective ban on shale gas projects after withdrawing its application for two wells in Lancashire. Aurora Energy Resources blamed the government’s “de facto ban on shale gas activity” for its decision to drop an application to frack at Altcar Moss in west Lancashire. The Aberdeen-based gas company has reignited an industry row with the government over its decision late last year to follow the Scottish government’s lead by ending fracking in England. Ian Roche, the managing director of Aurora, said it was “unsurprising” that council officers in Lancashire felt unable to make a decision on the application, which it submitted months before the government imposed a fracking moratorium in November. The government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking in England “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe, after a series of earth tremors in the Lancashire area raised concerns. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. The process often results in seismic activity, but the industry has claimed that the tremors are too weak to pose a threat to public safety. Roche said Aurora plans to “address this issue” with the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “It is clear from recent comments by the minister of state for energy that the government considers the ‘moratorium’ on hydraulic fracturing to be a de facto ban on shale gas activity in the UK. It is therefore perhaps unsurprising that the council officers have felt unable to determine this application,” Roche said. “It is our view that there is no scientific or public policy justification for the current ‘moratorium’ and Aurora has compiled a body of compelling evidence showing it to be an extreme example of asymmetric regulation, and out of line with the regulation of public amenity impacts across other industries,” he added. The de facto fracking ban was welcomed by green groups last year as a watershed moment for environmental campaigners and local communities which have opposed shale gas fracking in the UK for years. A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment."
"A lack of bees in agricultural areas is limiting the supply of some food crops, a new US-based study has found, suggesting that declines in the pollinators may have serious ramifications for global food security. Species of wild bees, such as bumblebees, are suffering from a loss of flowering habitat, the use of toxic pesticides and, increasingly, the climate crisis. Managed honeybees, meanwhile, are tended to by beekeepers, but have still been assailed by disease, leading to concerns that the three-quarters of the world’s food crops dependent upon pollinators could falter due to a lack of bees. The new research appears to confirm some of these fears. Of seven studied crops grown in 13 states across America, five showed evidence that a lack of bees is hampering the amount of food that can be grown, including apples, blueberries and cherries. A total of 131 crop fields were surveyed for bee activity and crop abundance by a coalition of scientists from the US, Canada and Sweden. “The crops that got more bees got significantly more crop production,” said Rachael Winfree, an ecologist and pollination expert at Rutgers University who was a senior author of the paper, published by the Royal Society. “I was surprised, I didn’t expect they would be limited to this extent.” The researchers found that wild native bees contributed a surprisingly large portion of the pollination despite operating in intensively farmed areas largely denuded of the vegetation that supports them. Wild bees are often more effective pollinators than honeybees but research has shown several species are in sharp decline. The rusty patched bumblebee, for example, was the first bee to be placed on the US endangered species list in 2017 after suffering an 87% slump in the previous two decades. Swaths of American agriculture is propped up by honeybees, frantically replicated and shifted around the country in hives in order to meet a growing need for crop pollination. Almonds, one of the two crops not shown to be suffering from a lack of bees in the study, are mostly grown in California, where most of the beehives in the US are trucked to each year for a massive almond pollination event. The US is at the forefront of divergent trends that are being replicated elsewhere in the world – as farming becomes more intensive to churn out greater volumes to feed a growing global population, tactics such as flattening wildflower meadows, spraying large amounts of insecticide and planting monocultural fields of single crops are damaging the bee populations crucial for crop pollination. According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, the amount of crop production dependent upon insect and other pollinators has increased 300% over the past 50 years. Pollination shortfalls could cause certain fruit and vegetables to become rarer and more expensive, triggering nutritional deficits in diets. Staple foods such as rice, wheat and corn won’t be affected, however, as they are pollinated via the wind. “Honeybee colonies are weaker than they used to be and wild bees are declining, probably by a lot,” said Winfree. “The agriculture is getting more intensive and there are fewer bees, so at some point the pollination will become limited. Even if honeybees were healthy, it’s risky to rely so much on a single bee species. It’s predictable that parasites will target the one species we have in these monocultural crop fields.” The paper recommends that farmers gain a better understanding of the optimal amount of pollination needed to boost crop yields, as well as review whether the level of pesticide and fertilizer put on to fields is appropriate. “The trends we are seeing now are setting us up for food security problems,” Winfree said. “We aren’t yet in a complete crisis now but the trends aren’t going in the right direction. Our study shows this isn’t a problem for 10 or 20 years from now – it’s happening right now.”"
"Cyme, umbel and corymb: there is poetry in botanical jargon. It describes, concisely, the functional architecture of inflorescences that are crowded together, and competing for pollinators, along this unmown length of road verge. The Russian comfrey is attracting a constant stream of bumblebees. Some, with full pollen baskets, must have been foraging since sunrise but stop by on their way back to the nest for an energy top-up, from nectar hidden in its flowers. They are arranged in pairs along each inflorescence axis, which is curled like a scorpion’s tail, for this is a scorpioid cyme. Jewel-like purple buds elongate as it uncoils, to become dangling tubular corollas, at a rate of just two per day. Comfrey is parsimonious with its rewards, which can only be reached by long-tongued pollinators that struggle awkwardly, upside down, to reach the nectar. Life is easier, a leisurely walk in the park, for the hoverflies, soldier beetles and a single wasp on the hogweed inflorescence nearby. It’s a compound umbel, a flat platform of clusters of small, white florets, supported by stems arranged like spokes of miniature umbrellas, each in turn supported by a spoke of a larger umbrella. Hoverflies land, unfold their tongues and wander over this floral plain, eating some pollen but dragging more over the receptive stigmas of the florets. Arching overhead are flat, cream corymbs of elder blossom, some as large as tea plates, open tables for any passing insect. From below I can see that the florets have a different underpinning architecture. Each main supporting spoke rises from the same point but then sub-branches, each tipped with clusters of florets, become progressively shorter towards the top of the spoke. The result is another level floral playing field, another way of constructing an inflorescence and servicing insect visitors. There is pleasure in dawdling along this lane, pulling flowers apart, trying to better understand how they work, how variation in the precise, programmed timing of events during their development produces such differing, exquisite outcomes, all ultimately serving the same purpose. While botanical jargon plays in my head: cyme, umbel, corymb; incantations of summer."
"For the first time in 20 years forestry operations may have to be assessed under national environmental laws after the federal court ruled VicForests had breached laws related to threatened species. Friends of Leadbeater’s Possum had challenged logging by the state-owned forestry corporation in 66 coupes in Victoria’s central highlands. The environment group argued VicForests had breached the code of practice in its regional forestry agreement and that its exemption from national environmental laws should therefore not apply. It said the court should prevent further logging unless it was assessed and approved by the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley. In a judgment on Wednesday, the court agreed VicForests had breached provisions related to environmental conservation in the code of conduct, and that past and proposed logging would have a significant impact on the vulnerable greater glider and the critically endangered Leadbeater’s possum. Danya Jacobs, a senior lawyer with Environmental Justice Australia, which represented Friends of the Leadbeater’s Possum, said the case had profound implications. “The logging industry has operated for 20 years as if it doesn’t have to comply with our federal environment laws because of regional forest agreements,” she said. “This case overturns that position and clearly finds that the exemption can and will be lost where threatened species protections are not complied with.” The parties to the case are now expected to respond to the findings before the court finalises its orders. A VicForests spokesman said the agency “acknowledges today’s decision of the federal court and will carefully consider the implications on its harvesting program.” The case is only the second in the 21-year history of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to challenge the special exemption given to the forestry industry. Its ramifications could extend beyond Victoria to logging operations in other states. A spokesman for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the department would “carefully consider the Federal Court’s 450 page judgment, noting that formal orders are yet to be made”. He said the court had made key findings regarding the exemption national laws granted to forestry “which will require detailed consideration before the department can discuss possible implications”. Under the EPBC Act, forestry operations are exempt from assessment if they are conducted in accordance with a regional forestry agreement – long-term bilateral agreements between state and federal governments. In Victoria, these agreements include a code of practice that sets out conditions logging operations must meet, including in relation to threatened species. Friends of Leadbeater’s Possum argued VicForests had breached the code of practice in its agreement and that its agreement and exemption from national law were, in effect, invalid. In her judgment, justice Debra Mortimer found VicForests had breached the code of practice by not complying with the precautionary principle relating to conservation of the environment. She found logging in 26 coupes had not complied with the central highlands RFA and that logging yet to be conducted in a further 41 coupes was not likely to be conducted in accordance with the RFA. One coupe was partially logged and counted in both categories. The president of Friends of Leadbeater’s Possum, Steve Meacher, said the outcome was a “huge win not just for the Leadbeater’s possum and the greater glider but for wildlife threatened by logging across the country. “No government or company should be exempt from national environment laws that are in place to protect our threatened species. “We must stop the senseless logging of critical threatened species’ habitat or we will drive them to extinction.” In a summary, Mortimer said the court had accepted evidence that the greater glider, the Leadbeater’s possum, or both animals, were found in or around each of the 66 coupes. In relation to the greater glider, the court found VicForests “has not engaged, and is not likely to engage, in a careful evaluation of management options to avoid wherever practical the very real threats of serious damage to the Greater Gilder which are posed by its forestry operations in the central highlands”. It found that in planning and conducting logging and in deciding where it would log, VicForests had “insufficient regard” to high quality greater glider habitat, the presence of greater gliders in areas it planned to log, and to the additional pressures greater gliders were facing due to bushfires. It said policies VicForests had developed that were meant to manage the greater glider were instead “defensive documents” that suggested “VicForests felt obliged to have a policy addressing further protection for the greater glider, but was reluctant to implement it”. The court found logging in the 66 coupes – both past and planned – was likely to have a significant impact on one or both species, and that management operations meant to reduce the impact “have not been effective to arrest the decline of the greater glider and the Leadbeater’s possum”. “Not only do VicForests’ forestry operations damage or destroy existing habitat critical to the survival of the two species, they also prevent new areas of forest from developing into such habitat in the future,” the summary states. The court accepted the view of experts that habitat within the coupes was of increasing importance because of the threat posed by more frequent and intense bushfires. Jacobs said when governments failed to protect threatened species it fell to small community groups and public interest lawyers to hold them to account in the courts. “As the extinction crisis accelerates, it’s vital that our environment laws work to protect what is left,” she said. The Greens said all native forestry operations now “faced a cascade of legal challenges”. “This is a hugely significant decision. It shows the provisions of our logging laws under the Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) are not working to protect threatened species,” the party’s forestry spokesperson, Senator Janet Rice, said. Amelia Young, the national campaigns director for the Wilderness Society, described it as “the Franklin Dam of forest legal judgments”. “The case has laid bare the staggering unsustainability of industrial native forest logging and the catastrophic failures of governments in stopping their own agencies from sending our wildlife into the abyss of extinction,” she said. “State governments have for decades exploited their exemption from national environment laws under the regional forest agreements, while logging native forests to secure unsustainable volumes of wood, and in doing so, push forest dwelling species to the brink of extinction.” The Australian Forest Products Association said the court’s decision meant the future of regional forestry agreements was uncertain and called on state and federal governments to “urgently” respond. The association’s chief executive, Ross Hampton, said “the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers in Tasmania, Victoria, NSW, and Western Australia is at stake” if questions the court’s findings raised about RFAs were not resolved. “Regional Forest Agreements have been in place for more than 20 years and are required by law to be independently reviewed every five years, and all reviews conducted have found that they are meeting or exceeding all environmental objectives while providing a level of certainty to industry,” he said."
"The Trump administration is finalizing rules that will allow hunters in Alaska’s national preserves to shoot bears and wolves, and their cubs and pups, while they are in their dens. The National Park Service is reversing regulations written by the Barack Obama administration, which banned some of the much-criticized practices for hunting the predators, including luring bears with food like doughnuts. Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, called the rule change “amazingly cruel” and said it was “just the latest in a string of efforts to reduce protections for America’s wildlife at the behest of oil companies and trophy hunters”. The park service’s deputy director, David Vela, said the change would “more closely align hunting and trapping regulations with those established by the state of Alaska”. The regulation is expected to be formally published this week. Alaska laws would still apply. The state generally prohibits killing bear cubs, but it allows some exceptions in Alaska’s interior region. The Alaska senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said the revision was needed “not only as a matter of principle, but as a matter of states’ rights”. A tribal consortium, the Tanana Chiefs Conference, said the Obama rule was implemented without adequate tribal consultation, in disregard to rural Alaska’s dependence on wild food resources, threatening “centuries-long sustainable management practices”. Peter Christian, a spokesman with the park service in Alaska, told the Anchorage Daily News that the changes will allow hunters to draw black bears, including cubs and females with cubs, out of their dens with artificial light; to use bait to attract black and brown bears; to hunt wolves and coyotes during the denning season and to shoot caribou while they are swimming or from motorboats. “These harvest practices would be allowed in national preserves where authorized by the state of Alaska,” Christian said. The Obama administration said its rules were necessary to avoid artificially reducing Alaska’s predator populations and destabilizing its ecosystems. Trump’s Department oof the Interior has consistently sought to expand access to public lands to hunters and fossil fuel companies. Last month, it proposed expanding public hunting and fishing access by more than 2.3m acres on 97 national wildlife refuges and nine national fish hatcheries."

"Millions of tons of manure from Minnesota’s animal feedlots is a risk to consumer health as it threatens to raise nitrate and phosphorus levels in the state’s rivers, lakes and drinking water, a study has found. Meat and dairy production in the US is dominated by the use of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) where animals are raised or fattened in close confinement. Since 1991, the number of CAFOs in Minnesota has trebled, with about 80 million pigs, cows and poultry now held in feedlots. The state has one of the most detailed databases in the US on all of its animal farms.In “almost all of Minnesota’s farm counties” the combined use of manure plus commercial fertiliser, is “likely to load too much nitrogen or phosphorus or both on to crop fields, threatening drinking water and fouling the state’s iconic lakes and rivers”, found the report by the US NGO, the Environmental Working Group (EWG). The increasing number of feedlots has come at the same time as a deterioration in nitrate contamination. An earlier EWG investigation found that 63% of Minnesota public water utilities with elevated levels of nitrate saw the contamination worsen between 1995 and 2018.In an email response, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) said “nitrate contamination of groundwater is a growing concern in Minnesota”. It said “high levels” in drinking water “can cause health problems, especially for infants”, and bring extra management costs for community water systems and homeowners. The planting of corn, often fed to livestock, had risen too, EWG said, up by 1.5m acres since the 1990s. Annual fertiliser sales in the state are up from about 2.3m tons in 1989 to just over 3m tons in 2017, according to a Minnesota Department of Agriculture report. The Minnesota Corn Growers Association did not respond to requests for comment. Drinking water with high nitrogen levels is linked to cancers and blue baby syndrome, known technically as methaemoglobinaemia. On its water sanitation page, the World Health Organization (WHO) says this condition is caused by “the decreased ability of blood to carry vital oxygen around the body” and it expresses special concern for bottle-fed infants. The US Environmental Protection Agency says too much nitrogen and phosphorus are also known to support algae blooms in lakes. The algae can produce bacteria toxic to humans. To manage manure buildup from livestock, some of which collects in giant lagoons, feedlots often spread it on nearby farmland which can already have commercial fertiliser applied, said the EWG study co-author, Sarah Porter. Water running off fields is known to carry nitrates and phosphorus into the state’s rivers, lakes and tap water, she said. The study has produced a manure map showing every crop field across Minnesota that is likely to receive manure from nearby cattle, hog or poultry feedlots and estimates the amount of manure applied. Using data from county fertiliser sales and other state sources, plus the manure data, the EWG produced two more maps showing their findings for total nitrogen and phosphorus overloads. A spokesperson for the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), Forrest Peterson, said there are about 18,000 registered feedlots in the state, with the largest CAFOs holding up to 125,000 animals or poultry. Asked for further comment on the study the agency said it needed time to review it. The MPCA lists more than 3,000 water bodies in the state that fail to meet quality standards, with 85% of those impairments due to non-point pollution from “nitrogen, bacteria, chloride and phosphorus”. Non-point source pollution is described by the MPCA as pollutants carried by water moving over and through ground into lakes, rivers and streams. Nitrate is a vital fertiliser component, but as well as a methaemoglobinemia warning, an MDH factsheet says a “growing body of literature indicates potential associations between nitrate/nitrite exposure and other health effects such as increased heart rate, nausea, headaches and abdominal cramps”. The MDH factsheet adds that some studies “suggest an increased risk of cancer, especially gastric cancer, associated with dietary nitrate/nitrite exposure, but there is not yet scientific consensus on this question”. The EWG study said feedlot expansion in Minnesota has been concentrated in the southern and central parts of the state, most notably in Martin County. The county, it said, is “home to 15 lakes on Minnesota’s 2020 list of nutrient-impaired water bodies. The list includes Budd Lake, which serves as the drinking water source for the town of Fairmont”. Phosphorus pollution, the EWG study said, can trigger potentially toxic algae blooms in lakes and rivers. A July 2015 warning from the MPCA describes the hospitalisation of a child “after being exposed to blue-green algae” while swimming in Lake Henry, about an hour-and-a-half northwest of Minneapolis. In a nearby lake two dogs died from blue-green algae exposure and others were sick. Porter said animal feedlots can be a source of friction too. “Some people benefit economically, others suffer the side effects.” She said she hoped the manure map and its data will be used by state authorities to make “better decisions about how many more farms they want to provide permits for”.In its email, the MDH added that the best way to prevent nitrate contamination is at source and said it is working with “city water utilities, non-profits, the agricultural sector” and others on prevention, conservation and systemic change initiatives to protect source water quality."
"﻿A Californian startup that pioneered a high-tech solution to reducing food waste has secured personal investment from Oprah Winfrey and Katy Perry in its latest fundraising drive. Perishable produce such as avocados, lemons and limes stay ripe for twice as long as usual due to an edible spray-on coating on their skin made from plant materials and devised by Apeel Sciences. On Tuesday, the company announced it had raised further capital of $250m (£203m), led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Government of Singapore Investment Corporation GIC to help finance its expansion and tackle the disruption to the global food supply chain caused by Covid-19. This year, the company said it is due to save 20m pieces of fruit from going to waste at retail outlets, while also extending shelf-life in the home, where food waste rates are three times as high. James Rogers, the Apeel Sciences founder and chief executive, said: “Food waste is an invisible tax imposed on everyone that participates in the food system. Eliminating global food waste can free up $2.6tn annually, allowing us to make the food ecosystem better for growers, distributors, retailers, consumers and our planet. We’re putting time back on the industry’s side to help deal with the food waste crisis and the challenges it poses to food businesses.” The food technology startup was founded in 2012 with a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to help reduce food waste in developing countries without access to refrigeration. It works with exporters to treat fresh produce before it is transported around the world. Globally, almost a third of all the food produced, approximately 1.3bn tonnes, is wasted every year. First used commercially in the US in 2018, the coating has helped to more than halve supermarkets’ fresh produce waste. It is also being used elsewhere, including in large supermarket chains in Germany and Denmark; the UK is due to follow this year. Asda carried out consumer trials last autumn on mandarins from Peru and tests on cucumbers, which could dispense with the need for plastic wrapping. The company’s new investors, Winfrey and Perry, live in Santa Barbara, near its headquarters in Goleta. Winfrey is an avocado aficionado and has an orchard at her Californian home. Apeel tested the technology on avocados because of their short period of perfect ripeness and relatively high price. It has opened satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey. It works with five suppliers of avocados, including two of the world’s largest, Del Monte and Del Rey. Although helping US and European produce suppliers and retailers will remain a priority, Apeel’s new funding will help it support farmers and communities in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, which are at greater risk of food security issues.﻿"
"A federal government scientific report has issued a warning about chemicals used in unconventional gas drilling in the sensitive wild rivers of the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin. As the government weighs up recommendations to expand the gas industry for a post-coronavirus recovery, the western rivers of Queensland loom as a significant test for how authorities will balance economics with the environment. The rivers and floodplains that fracture and snake towards the great inland lake are largely unaffected by the sort of developments and other interventions that have made a mess of the Murray-Darling system. At the same time, the channel country area is considered to have significant potential for the rapid expansion of gas drilling. The federal government’s bioregional assessments program this month released a report on the region, in which it identified several significant “knowledge gaps” about the geology and the impact of gas development on the waterways, which require further study. These gaps include whether surface infrastructure could divert floodwaters; the potential for unconventional gas developments to affect the migration of groundwater between different formations; and the potential for the extraction of water from shallow aquifers to impact ground and surface water. “Further work is required to develop conceptual models that explicitly link risks due to shale, tight and deep coal gas development with individual threatened species, other important ecological assets and other extant threatening processes,” the report said. It said of 116 chemicals known to be used in drilling and fracking, 33 were assessed as being of “potentially high concern” and 41 were of “potential concern”. Last month, the Guardian reported that a leaked Queensland government scientific report – made confidential and ignored by the state – recommended a ban on fracking in the channel country and the exclusion of all gas wells from floodplain areas. Concerns about gas development in the channel country are not necessarily related to the broader debate about the safety of practices such as fracking, which advocates say cause little harm with proper regulation, but which remains a controversial and often unpopular practice. Rather, there are specific concerns in the channel country, where no two flood events are the same and locals say water flows can be diverted or blocked by the most minor artificial structure in the floodplain channels. “[An obstruction] 10 inches or a foot [30cm] high can block floodwater back for some distance,” says Peter Douglas, a grazier from the Barcoo shire. Douglas said the wild rivers protections in place in Queensland – overhauled by the Newman government in 2014 – had changed the regulatory situation from one where “you couldn’t turn a bulldozer around” to an open-slather arrangement with no real restrictions. Gas drilling – and fracking – has taken place in the area since 1969 and the industry says it has not yet had a detrimental impact. Douglas said his concern about the expansion of the industry, and potential for unconventional gas drilling in the area, was that it would likely require larger infrastructure. “You stick a couple of pads in line across the Cooper it will change the flow of the Cooper. Every flood we have is different – it’s close to impossible to do any modelling.” Riley Rocco, the coordinator of the Western Rivers Alliance, said the federal government’s bioregional assessment report identified several potential hazards and that the channel country should be considered unique. “These are the last remaining free-flowing desert rivers in the world,” Rocco said. “We want to see all unconventional gas activity banned from the river and floodplain. While everything is on hold (due to the coronavirus), there should be a moratorium on any new exploration or production or lease to ensure this isn’t seen as an opportunity for the gas company to get a foothold in new areas.” Labor had opposed the scrapping of wild rivers legislation in opposition; now in government it has promised a review of environmental protections but at the same time has approved new large-scale exploration permits. The ABC has revealed gas giant Santos was given extended rights to explore the channel country last year. As part of its review, the state commissioned an environmental report but ultimately buried its findings and released a framework that critics say favours the gas industry. The Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, has said the framework seeks to strike a balance between protections and encouraging economic activity. The gas industry’s peak body, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said oil and gas activity had occurred in the Lake Eyre basin and elsewhere in Queensland for more than 50 years. “Just last month, a CSIRO field study found the use of hydraulic fracturing has little to no impact on groundwater, waterways, soils or air quality,” APPEA Queensland director Georgy Mayo said. “The [federal government bioregional assessment] report is a risk assessment only and has not considered the extensive regulatory controls, in place at a state and federal level, which are supplemented by the world-class operating standards of the oil and gas industry. “The baseline data, knowledge and conceptual models outlined in the report are the building blocks for the [next stage] impact analysis and management for the … region.”"
"Clearing of bushland in the small New South Wales south coast town of Manyana will be halted temporarily after a community environment group trying to save the unburnt habitat began legal action in the federal court. Ozy Homes has a development consent for the 20 hectares that dates back to 2008. But the area is now the only significant piece of unburnt bushland for kilometres after it was saved by volunteer firefighters during the summer bushfire disaster. The Manyana Matters Environmental Association has now launched a legal challenge to try to protect the area and is seeking an injunction from the court to stop any clearing. Ozy Homes agreed on Wednesday to temporarily stop works until the matter returns to court again in June. The company has also agreed to allow ecological experts for Manyana Matters to access the area and conduct surveys for threatened species including the greater glider, which is listed as vulnerable under national environmental law. The company will be permitted to complete fencing work around the site’s perimeter. “This is only the first step for us in assisting our clients to protect the greater glider and this now critical piece of land,” said David Morris, the chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office. The Manyana case has attracted high-profile support from the actor Claudia Karvan, who filmed a video calling for the NSW government to protect the bushland as a wildlife refuge for threatened species. The Manyana Matters group says the site is habitat for the greater glider and the swift parrot and wants the state government to buy back the land and turn it into a nature reserve. It is unclear whether greater gliders are now using the site. The project has never been assessed under Australia’s national environmental law, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, but has a state development consent. At the time of the initial proposal in 2008, the greater glider was not listed as a threatened species under the EPBC Act. The species was formally listed as vulnerable in 2016. It is now one of the federal government’s priority species requiring urgent assessment after fires destroyed parts of its habitat in Victoria and NSW. The EDO will argue that the planned development is now a breach of federal environmental law. The legal firm will seek a declaration that the clearing is likely to have a significant impact on the greater glider and should not be permitted to proceed unless it assessed and approved at a federal level. The Manyana development is just one project that highlights the problems that can arise for species when environmental catastrophes occur in the period between a development being granted approval and works commencing. In many instances this timeframe can be several years and a species status can change owing to mounting pressures from drought, heatwaves and fires, or as a result of threats such as clearing for other projects. “It is clear that a paradigm shift is needed to protect Australia’s incredible wildlife, which suffered so tremendously last summer,” Morris said. “Unfortunately, through no fault of their own, the developer of this site now owns a piece of land that may be critical to the survival of the greater glider.” Since the fire disaster the planned Shenhua Watermark coalmine and logging in NSW and Victoria – which is exempt from federal environmental laws – have also been identified as development that will push species under pressure closer to extinction unless governments decide to step in. Morris said the coronavirus pandemic had affected the ability to conduct thorough assessments of the full impact of the fires. “The proper approach” would be to pause development of sites that might now hold increased importance to the survival of species, he said. The independent ecologist will be granted access to the site for three days and nights. The matter is scheduled to be heard by the federal court again on 5 June. Ozy Homes said it could not comment on a matter before the court. But its managing director, Ghazi Sangari, said the project had planning approvals and construction certificates and would employ more than 100 people. He said there had been several presales of houses in the planned develompent. Sangari said the company had undertaken work to assess the potential impact on matters of national environmental significance and had been advised in 2018 the project did not warrant assessment under national environmental laws. He said ecologists were now on site “obtaining further data to assess the potential ecological impact of the development, given the bushfires last summer which changed the landscape of the surrounding area”. “If our legal obligations change as a result of this work and information reported to us, then we will fulfil these obligations,” he said."
"Ten corporations that agreed to a total of $56m in civil penalties for allegedly breaking environmental laws are not being required to make payments under a pause granted by the US government during the Covid-19 pandemic. The companies polluted air and water, including in communities already vulnerable to toxic pollution like East Chicago, Indiana, according to legal proceedings. They signed settlements with the government agreeing to pay fines without admitting liability but the justice department last month advised most of the companies of extensions in letters which were obtained by the government watchdog group Accountable.US via public records requests. Denver-based oil and gas company K P Kauffman allegedly violated air pollution laws, emitting volatile organic compounds that form smog in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, an area that wasn’t meeting smog standards. The company settled and agreed to pay $1m in eight installments over four years, but it has not been required to pay its second installment because of the freeze. The company did not respond to requests for comment. KP Kauffman spent $200,000 lobbying the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2016, the company hosted a meeting between oil industry executives and president Donald Trump, although the company’s CEO Kevin P Kauffman, a major GOP donor, did not attend. Chris Saeger, director of strategic initiatives at Accountable.US, said: “This is exactly the time to make sure support is flowing to the federal, state and local governments that need a hand with responding to the coronavirus crisis and with the environmental problems that these special interests have caused.” “When we’re facing a public health crisis that causes respiratory problems, this is a time to be holding companies to a higher standard of air quality, not a lower one.” The companies will not be required to pay penalties before 1 June, although they have the option to do so and at least two companies told the Guardian they made payments despite the extension. The EPA would not respond to inquiries about its policy and or say which companies paid penalties. The justice department on 14 April sent letters to the affected companies, offering to temporarily suspend collection of the payments, following the EPA’s announcement in March that it would ease some enforcement requirements. The justice department said the suspension was meant to “mitigate the financial impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic”. One company, Virginia power provider Dominion Energy, settled and agreed to pay $1.4m for allegedly releasing 27.5m gallons of water from a coal ash impoundment that seeped into groundwater along the shore of the James River. Coal ash contains dangerous pollutants, including mercury, cadmium and arsenic, which can cause widespread environmental damage. The company said it plans to pay the settlement penalty once it is finalized. Dominion has a number of ties to high-ranking Trump officials, including EPA’s former top enforcement official, Patrick Traylor, who had Dominion has a client. Attorney general William Barr has served on the company’s board of directors and received more than $500,000 from Dominion. Another alleged violator, one of the world’s largest steel companies, ArcelorMittal, decided to pay the $5m penalty it agreed to for air quality issues at steel plants in East Chicago, Indiana; Burns Harbor, Indiana; and Cleveland, Ohio, according to a spokesman. ArcelorMittal’s chief executive was at a Trump roundtable of business leaders in India in February and also was one of about 20 executives to dine with Trump in Davos at the World Economic Forum in January. Trump’s commerce secretary Wilbur Ross was previously on the company’s board of directors. The oil and gas company BP Products North America said it also paid the $8m penalty it agreed to for alleged air pollution problems at an oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana, on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan. BP was accused of emitting too much particle pollution, which is linked to asthma and heart attacks. The justice department’s assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski represented BP in the past. BP employees have given $85,000 to Trump campaign groups. A spokeswoman said BP employees in the US are free to give money to the political campaigns of their choice."
"Australia’s major electricity and gas companies, including the owners of all coal-fired power plants in the national grid, have called on the Morrison government to set a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in line with the Paris agreement. In a statement on Thursday, the Australian Energy Council said it supported the 2015 Paris deal, and recognised it meant developed countries needed to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. It will increase pressure on the federal government to support the target, which has been backed by business groups, banks, major miners, the ACTU, institutional investors, all state governments and the federal opposition. The energy council’s chief executive, Sarah McNamara, said its members accepted the science of climate change and the need to decarbonise the economy. She said they had consistently argued for “well-designed, market-based, and stable national policy settings” that would guide investment decisions. “The first step to reducing carbon emissions is agreement on a long-term target which can act as the starting point for constructive consensus,” she said. “Settling on an economy-wide target will let us then decide the best ways to get there and what policy and mechanisms could be applied.” The statement follows the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, on Wednesday using a speech to the National Press Club to set out principles for a bipartisan agreement to end more than a decade of political fighting over climate and energy policy. Albanese also released a letter to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in which he said Labor was open-minded on a policy mechanism as long as it was not the existing emissions reduction fund and climate targets could be changed by whichever party was in government. McNamara said the energy council welcomed the government’s commitment to support “transformational technologies” through low-emissions technology statements, believing it could help lead to a consensus on a long-term target. She said a net zero target did not imply that electricity emissions would necessarily fall to zero by 2050. “Depending on technological developments, it may prove cost-effective to have a small level of emissions offset by carbon sinks elsewhere,” she said. “But our efforts need to be broader, and a net zero emissions target across the economy, we believe, is the best way forward to deliver the Paris temperature goals at the lowest economic and social cost.” The government has resisted setting a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, saying it would not adopt a mid-century target without a plan to achieve it. It has promised a long-term climate strategy before the next major UN climate conference, which has been delayed until November 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has previously said signatories to the Paris agreement, including Australia, agreed to hit net zero “in the second half of the century”. But the deal reached in the French capital also included commissioning the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to examine what would be necessary to pursue efforts to limit global heating above pre-industrial levels to 1.5C, a headline goal of the agreement. In 2018, the panel advised it would require global net zero emissions by about 2050. On Thursday, a spokesperson for Taylor said the government was taking action now to reduce global emissions, had a clear 2030 emissions reduction target of a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels, and was committed to the net zero emissions goal for the second-half of the century as stated in the Paris agreement. “Our commitment is clear – lower prices, keep the lights on, while doing our bit to reduce global emissions without wrecking the economy. And we are seeing results,” the spokesperson said. The most recent official data suggests national emissions had dipped just 1.5% since the Coalition was elected in 2013 after falling about 14% while Labor was in power for the previous six years. Labor’s climate and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said the energy council statement showed Morrison was out of step with both scientists and Australian businesses. He said the government needed to listen to climate scientists as it listened to scientists in its response to coronavirus. “In adopting net zero emissions by 2050, the [council] joins 73 nations, every state and territory in Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, our biggest airline, our biggest mining company, our biggest bank, our biggest telecommunications provider, and countless experts and scientists,” Butler said. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said 2050 was too late to reach net zero emissions, and accused the energy companies of fighting any immediate action to “replace their polluting plants with renewables”. He said backing the Paris agreement would mean the closure of 12 of Australia’s coal power plants in the next decade. “If the energy council isn’t prepared to close a serious number of coal-fired power stations within the next 10 years then this announcement is a cruel hoax that our kids will pay for with severe bushfires, drought and rising sea levels,” Bandt said. The energy council represents 24 businesses that generate the overwhelming majority of Australia’s electricity, including AGL, Origin and EnergyAustralia. It is part of a group known as the Australian Climate Roundtable that has previously called for Australia to adopt policies that can put it on a stable path to net zero emissions, but that statement did not include a timeframe. The IPCC found limiting global heating to 1.5C was likely to require coal power being cut by between 59% and 78% below 2010 levels by 2030, and by between 73% and 97% by 2050."
"The New South Wales government has dropped a plan that could have opened up new areas of the state’s protected old-growth forests to logging. Conservationists have called the decision a win for the state’s environment and threatened wildlife after years of habitat loss and the devastating 2019-20 bushfires. Guardian Australia revealed last year the government had asked the state’s Natural Resources Commission (NRC) to remap old-growth forest in the state’s north-east, a move that potentially would have opened areas to the timber industry that are currently off limits. The proposal prompted anger from conservationists, who have put pressure on the government to keep the protections in place. In a report, quietly published on Thursday, the NRC said it had suspended the project and would redirect the money it planned to use for the old-growth reassessment into its forest monitoring and improvement program. “This is a terrific result for our forests and wildlife,” the Nature Conservation Council chief executive, Chris Gambian, said. “We have been saying for months that logging in public native forests must be suspended in the wake of the bushfires, at least until a full ecological assessment has been conducted.” Gambian said suspending the remapping project was a sensible first step toward better protection of the state’s native forests. “The next step is to develop a plan to end native forest logging once and for all and to ensure a just transition for timber workers and the industry.” In its report, the commission said more than 102,000 hectares of mapped old-growth forest on the state’s north coast – 45% of mapped old growth in the region – had experienced either full or partial burning of the tree canopy in the 2019-20 fire disaster. The commission said that because of this the remote sensing it planned to use to develop the new maps could no longer be accurately applied. “The commission advised the NSW government we would be unable to continue in accordance with the terms of reference,” the commission said. “Based on this advice, the NSW government has now suspended the program and approved the remaining funds being repurposed to the Forest Monitoring and Improvement Program.” The independent MLC Justin Field welcomed the redirection of the funding but said it was disappointing it had taken an unprecedented bushfire season for the government to abandon the proposal. Field said the proposed remapping exercise was indicative of a structural problem within the state’s native forestry industry that had been exacerbated by the fires. He said that with several north coast wood supply contracts set to expire in 2023, now was the time for the government to plan a fair transition out of native forest logging that would ensure long-term sustainability for the industry and aid the recovery of forests. “There has still not been any statewide assessment of the impact of the fires on state forests, including biodiversity and wood supply impact assessments, but Forestry Corporation has been allowed to recommence logging at near pre-fire rates in 65 state forests areas,” Field said. “There remains serious questions about the adequacy of the Environmental Protection Authority approval process for these bushfire-affected logging sites and how the fires have affected wood supply forecasts into the future.” Guardian Australia reported in March that logging had recommenced in some unburnt forest despite the areas being known habitat for threatened species that had been significantly affected by the fires. Field said no further logging approvals should be granted until the NRC had completed its wood supply assessment and the EPA could demonstrate there would be no negative impacts on wildlife and forest recovery. Guardian Australia has sought comment from the NSW planning minister, Rob Stokes."
"The call came over Tony Manu’s police radio one March day in 2017: some sort of pipe had exploded in the hills outside Pocatello, Idaho and the son of a well-known local doctor was hurt, or worse. Manu, a long-time detective with the county sheriff’s office, was shocked. A pipe bomb in Pocatello? “We were like, ‘Holy shit,’” says Manu. He hit the gas and screeched up winding mountain roads outside of town. “I thought maybe [the victim] was missing a leg or something. That is what it sounded like.” At the home of Dr Mansfield and his family, he found a frightening scene. On the driveway, just outside the sprawling timbered house, the family’s dog, Kasey, was dead. Inside the home, Canyon Mansfield, 14 years old, the youngest of three children, was sobbing. His head was pounding and his eyes were burning – he needed to go to the emergency room. Manu soon pieced together the story. While playing in the woods behind the family home, Canyon and his dog had stumbled upon a strange device that sprayed them in the face with a dose of of sodium cyanide. The boy managed to quickly clean the poison out of his eyes, but the dog collapsed and started convulsing. As Kasey lay dying on the hillside, Dr Mansfield had wanted to give Kasey CPR, but Canyon told him that if he did, he’d ingest the deadly stuff himself. It didn’t take detective Manu and his team of investigators long to uncover how it got there. The so-called cyanide bomb was not the work of some rogue actor or terrorist cell. It had been installed by a federal employee on official business. “The United States government put a cyanide bomb 350ft from my house, and killed my dog and poisoned my child,” said Theresa Mansfield, Canyon’s mother. More than three years later, she and her husband are in the midst of a legal and political campaign to hold the government accountable and ban the use of cyanide bombs nationwide. “I’m after justice,” she said. If you haven’t heard of the US agency that placed the bomb, you’re not alone. Its name is Wildlife Services, and for years it has operated in relative obscurity, with limited oversight from Congress or the American public. Housed in the Department of Agriculture, the agency primarily works on behalf of private ranchers and farmers, killing coyotes, wolves, bears, birds and other creatures that cause problems for agricultural interests. In 2018, it exterminated nearly 1.5 million native animals, and a huge number of invasive animals as well. Sometimes its agents shoot wolves or coyotes from helicopters. Sometimes they employ leg traps and snares. And sometimes they place poison devices on public and private land. M-44s, also known as “cyanide bombs”, are baited and spring-loaded tubes that spray an orange plume of cyanide powder when triggered. Aimed at coyotes and other canids that predate livestock, they killed 6,500 animals in 2018 alone. Congressman Peter DeFazio of Oregon, a long-time critic of Wildlife Services, has described the agency as more secretive than the Department of Homeland Security. “I served on the homeland security committee for a decade, and Wildlife Services, so called, is more opaque than some of our intelligence agencies,” said DeFazio. “Basically, in some cases, it is rogue.” He said that the agency, which has a century-long history and roughly 2,000 employees, is highly decentralized. State offices like the one in Idaho basically “run themselves”, with little transparency or accountability to elected officials in Washington. Even local law enforcement agencies are sometimes unaware of the extent of the agency’s activities in their jurisdictions. “I am telling you, I was in the total dark,” said Lorin Nielsen, the longtime sheriff of Bannock county, whose team of detectives responded to the Mansfield poisoning. “I had no idea [Wildlife Services] existed and why they existed and it still boggles me.” He said he was never notified that the agency was placing cyanide bombs in his community, or that such a thing even existed. Supporters of the agency include influential agriculture organizations. The American Sheep Industry Association has called the M-44 a “critical tool” that has a “proven track record of protecting livestock and the environment”. Wildlife Services declined to comment on the Mansfield case to the Guardian, and the agency only provided a link to a webpage in response to numerous questions concerning M-44s. In the past the agency, has said that it is committed “to safe and responsible use of these devices”. But a chorus of critics says the use of cyanide bombs, and the agency that administers them, is out of control. Theresa Mansfield is still furious about what Wildlife Services did to Canyon and Kasey, and takes every opportunity to make her feelings known. On a late afternoon last September, she hopped behind the wheel of her white SUV, drove into downtown Pocatello, and parked in front of a squat, nondescript brick building called the Pocatello Supply Depot. The building’s unassuming name belies its purpose. Equipped with security cameras and surrounded by barbed wire fencing, the facility is a federally owned warehouse and the key producer of M-44s in the US. The trapper that placed the devices behind the Mansfield family home, at the behest of a sheep rancher, regularly ordered sodium cyanide capsules from the depot, according to records obtained by the Western Watersheds Project, a conservation group, and reviewed by the Guardian. After arriving at the supply depot that day, Theresa Mansfield got out of her car and marched to the building’s front door. Just then, a man in jeans and boots appeared from around the corner and approached the depot entrance. Before he could get inside, Mansfield confronted the stranger and offered him a piece of her mind. “You here to pick up cyanide bombs?” she asked the man, who seemed taken aback by the question. The man smiled awkwardly, laughed, and said yes. “Don’t kill anyone,” Mansfield replied. Again, the man laughed nervously. “I’m serious,” she said, her voice rising. “You killed my dog and you almost killed my kid!” The man hurried into the depot without uttering another word. Ever since the poisoning, the Mansfields have waged a crusade of sorts against Wildlife Service and its killing practices, including filing a lawsuit against the agency in federal court in Idaho. They are seeking monetary damages, a public apology – and above all else, a ban on “cyanide bombs” nationwide. Wildlife Services has been mostly quiet about the litigation, though lawyers representing the agency initially responded to the Mansfield lawsuit by blaming the family for the tragic M-44 incident, before walking back that position. Still, the agency seems to be keenly aware of the rising tide of anti-cyanide-bomb sentiment. After the Mansfields traveled to Washington to meet lawmakers, the agency’s top official in Idaho sent news coverage of the visit to his colleagues, in an email obtained by the Guardian. In a separate email exchange in June 2018, a representative of the Idaho Wool Growers Association emailed the official, Todd Grimm, with a number of new clippings concerning the Mansfields. “One of the articles below is about M-44,” the wool representative wrote. “These people are driving me crazy.” “#MeToo,” Grimm replied, using the hashtag employed by opponents of sexual harassment. Public concern about Wildlife Services’ practices has been growing for years. According to a list of incidents compiled by the environmental group Predator Defense, roughly 40 domestic pets have been killed by M-44s across the country since 2000, and numerous humans have been exposed. “M-44s are indiscriminate killers and a public safety menace,” said Brooks Fahy, the executive director of Predator Defense, who is a leading opponent of M-44s and a key ally of the Mansfields. Yet the Mansfields and their allies in the wildlife conservation community appear to be moving the needle. In response to the Pocatello incident, Wildlife Services agreed in 2017 to impose a moratorium on the use of M-44s in Idaho, and last year, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a law that bans M-44s within its boundaries. Conservation organizations are also suing to force an environmental review of the Pocatello Supply Depot. In May 2019, DeFazio and Republican congressman Matt Gaetz re-introduced a bill, dubbed “Canyon’s Law”, that seeks to ban cyanide bombs nationwide. Jeff Merkley of Oregon has introduced a companion bill in the Senate. “I do not like the idea that if I am wandering on public land or my children are wandering on it or my wife, that we can stumble across and be poisoned by an exploding cyanide device or that our dog might be killed,” said Merkley. M-44s are “something that impinges on the ability of all of us who are co-owners of public lands to safely enjoy them”. Such efforts are running up against inertia – M-44s continue to be used in roughly a dozen states across the nation – and the Trump administration. In December 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency reauthorized the use of cyanide bombs nationwide. Canyon’s Law is currently stalled in Congress. But in an era of rising environmental consciousness, many advocates feel that public sentiment is shifting away from the sort of lethal predator-control practices that Wildlife Services embodies. And public sentiment is the key to reforming such an agency. The Mansfield case, said Fahy, “was the game-changer, it was the tipping point”. Canyon Mansfield still sometimes feels sad and guilty over the loss of Kasey. He gets the occasional crippling migraine, as well as a strange numbness in his hands that he never experienced before his exposure to sodium cyanide. But, as he prepares to head to college next year, he’s certain his family will prevail. “We are going to find a way to keep [Wildlife Services] up at night,” he said, “until we get this done.”"
"The natural gas giant Jemena has defended paying Instagram influencers, including former contestants of The Block, Married at First Sight and other reality TV shows, to promote the fossil fuel in social media posts. The #GoNaturalGas campaign from the Chinese and Singaporean-owned Jemena, which manages key natural gas pipelines around and out of Australia, appears to have been running for two years online, and comes amid concern liquified natural gas could be as bad for the environment as coal. Among the posts, first reported by the industry news site Renew Economy, influencers spruik natural gas as a good source of energy for staying warm, for kitchen use and for better health. Shannon and Simon Vos, the brothers who won season nine of The Block in 2014, are among several former reality TV stars to have taken part, advertising the #GoNaturalCampaign campaign to their 40,000 Instagram followers. In an Instagram post from August 2018, the brothers said: “If you’ve got a reno or a new build coming up, hook up to a sleek little gas hot water system and you’ll have all the steamy showers whenever you want and for how ever long it takes to turn those toes all wrinkly.” “We’ve got some hot tips for your bathroom build, and the dudes at GoNaturalGas.com.au have crunched the numbers and it seems that most of us want instant and long lasting hot water in our ideal homes. So take it from Simon (he’s a profeshimonal ) you can’t go past Gas.... #gonaturalgas,” the post said. A now-deleted post from Catherine Heraghty, director of Sydney-based interior design company The Stables, suggested clients designing bathrooms should choose natural gas to ensure hot showers. “In the cooler months of the year there is nothing like the warmth of a hot steamy shower after a cold winter’s day,” the post on The Stables’ Instagram account reportedly said to its 170,000 followers, before it was taken down. “When we built our house we decided to hook up to natural gas so that we could enjoy instant hot water that never runs out. I suggest to all of my clients that they consider hooking up to natural gas when building or renovating, there is nothing worse than running out of hot water at the end of the day and having a cold shower (the worst!!) or washing the dishes in cold water!” it said. Most of the paid posts appear to have been deleted after the publication of the Renew Economy article, with anti-natural gas posts warning “gas is a fossil fuel” and “gas ain’t cute” subsequently flooding out the feed for the hashtag #GoNaturalGas. Heraghty’s post declared that it was part of a paid partnership with the #GoNaturalGas campaign, but the Vos brothers’ post – which the Guardian has learnt was a paid post – did not. Roxy Jacenko, who represents Shannon and Simon Vos, said there was no legal requirement for the brothers to declare any paid partnership. “This job dates back to August 2018 – at that time there was no legal requirement to note whether the posting was paid or not,” Jacenko said. “As I understand, this is still not a legal requirement in Australia, it is up to the individual entirely.” Heraghty did not respond to requests for comment. This week the Australian Influencer Marketing Council, a body launched in 2019, released the industry’s first code of practice for influencers in Australia, to provide guidelines for social media personalities on legal recommendations, vetting potential partner companies, contract considerations and disclosing partnerships. “Consistent, agreed transparency of paid engagements is key to supporting best practice and industry self-regulation,” the code says. A Jemena spokesman told the Guardian: “We work with a variety of personalities to demonstrate the benefits of natural gas, which we know has less than half the carbon intensity of other fossil fuels, and, for many households, can significantly reduce their energy bills. “At the same time, we’re investing millions of dollars in renewable gas research and development projects, as we work towards modifying our network to transport green gas in the near future. “Taking this approach will save customers in the long-term as it will avoid millions of dollars in new infrastructure investment, while also avoiding putting increased pressure on the electricity network at peak times,” he said. The Jemena spokesman did not address questions about any complaints it had received from the public about the campaign, or whether the company directed the influencers it worked with to take down their posts in the aftermath of media attention. He did not confirm if the company was continuing to pay social media users to promote natural gas. The campaign comes as expert group Global Energy Monitor warned the liquefied natural gas industry will play at least as big a role as new coal investments in bringing on a climate crisis if all planned projects go ahead, a stance which appears to be at odds with comments by Australia’s emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, who has said the country could be proud that the rapidly expanding LNG export industry was displacing coal power overseas.

"The Morrison government is being urged to fix the use of environmental offsets to approve developments after an audit found major flaws in a system supposed to help protect threatened species from extinction. Scientists said the scathing audit of how the federal environment department administered national conservation laws suggested the use of offsets was worsening the impact on endangered species, not reducing it. Offsets are measures that are supposed to compensate for the loss of nationally important environmental areas to major development that has been approved under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. For example, a proposed development that would involve the loss of habitat that was home to Tasmanian devils could be approved if another existing area of devil habitat was protected and improved. The offset program has been controversial in part because it does not guarantee replacement habitat for threatened species or ecosystems, just that another area will not also be developed or some other form of compensation. Environment groups and scientists say the result is the gradual erosion of places for threatened species to live in a time of national extinction crisis. The audit by the Australian National Audit Office, released on Thursday, found the department had been ineffective in managing risks to the environment, and a blow-out in the time taken to make decisions correlated with a reduction in funding and staffing. It precedes a once-a-decade review of the legislation led by the former competition watchdog chair Graeme Samuel, who is due to release an interim report next week. It found environmental offsets had not been properly managed. Offsets were rarely included in project approvals when the legislation was introduced 20 years ago, but their use has increased markedly such that more than 70% of project approvals each year now includes them. Problems with offsets highlighted in the audit included: It found that offsets for some matters of national environmental significance were increasingly not possible due to a lack of suitable locations – effectively, that all the habitat had already been cleared or protected – or a lack of data. The response had been to approve more indirect offsets that did not result in a measurable conservation gain. Megan Evans, a researcher in environmental policy at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, said this finding was supported by independent research. She said instead of the increased scarcity of threatened species habitat being seen as an indication that further clearing should not be approved, the department had increasingly used alternatives to offsets such as providing research funding. “This is a real concern,” she said. “The offsets policy is not being applied in the way that it was designed too, and as such it is worsening the impact on biodiversity – the opposite of what it is meant to be doing.” Evans said failings in the legislation would lead to more species being at risk. “Unless there is substantial policy reform and additional resourcing, Australia’s trend of extinctions will continue,” she said. Sarah Bekessy, a professor of sustainability and urban planning at RMIT, said the offsetting system and its implementation were broken. She said it had been used to approve some developments that would otherwise have been ruled unacceptable, and not prevented serious impacts to endangered species. “I think the auditor-general’s report really focuses on the level of internal rigour around the implementation of offsets, which is fair enough, but there is a deeper issue. Every bit of scientific evidence is that they have failed to deliver positive benefits for biodiversity,” she said. “You can now basically do anything to critically endangered species and their habitat as long as you have an offset arrangement.” James Trezise, a policy analyst at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said there was no peer-reviewed evidence that showed the federal offsets system was working. “Offsets should be a measure of last resort, but are an over-utilised feature of almost every EPBC approval,” he said. “The lack of systems to track their performance means there is very limited evidence to drive policy improvement, which is clearly needed.” The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the auditor general’s report had focused on the department’s administration of the act and any wider assessment of the value of offsets would be the subject of a submission to the Samuel review. “The report underlines the importance of changes we are already taking in delivering $25m in funding to reduce unnecessary delay, to drive new technologies and to ensure a comprehensive review of the EPBC Act, which is no longer meeting the needs of environmental groups or proponents,” she said. “My focus will be on ensuring we have effective environmental protection, efficient processes and proper compliance in place.”"
"The roadside wildflowers around Ryhall are so special that in the 1980s the verges were designated as sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs). This is simultaneously a huge victory and a terrible tragedy. To the west of Ryhall, the Tolethorpe Road verges are slender, 5 metres at the widest point, but mostly much narrower. Despite this they are rich with plants; clumps of marjoram, knapweed, salad burnet and red and white clovers abound, while goat’s-beard seedheads project upwards like giant dandelions clocks. Knapweed plants are accompanied by the thick brown blooms of knapweed broomrape, a parasitic plant that lacks energy-trapping chlorophyll; instead they sap their magnificent vigour from their hosts. A low-growing plant with red stems, pinnate oval leaves and insipidly yellow vetch-like flowers is unfamiliar enough to summon the plant guide. Wild liquorice seems most likely and a nibble of a leaf leaves little doubt, a burst of liquorice followed by a lingeringly astringent taste like the most ferocious pea shoots you can imagine. More easily recognised, but just as unexpected, are the erect creamy heads of sulphur clover, a plant frequently found on clay soils in East Anglia. 68% of all sulphur clover sites are road verges – indeed a recent Plantlife report revealed that 91 road-verge inhabiting flowers are now threatened species. To the north of Ryhall, the Little Warren road verges have their own character. The hedges are set back several metres from the road, a clear indication that this was once a drover’s lane where great flocks of sheep were driven between pastures. Now that the landscape is almost exclusively arable, the bladder campion, pyramidal orchids, yellow rattle, rest harrow, meadow cranesbill and meadow vetchling are not meadow plants at all, they have become plants on the verge, clinging on despite the constant threat of nitrogen pollution from cars and ammonia from the fields. Despite the fragmentation of their habitats there is hope here, the SSSIs are being managed and the plants are hanging on. Perhaps the advent of the electric car will give them more breathing space, and one day they will be able to spread back into newly restored meadows.  "
"For those not directly affected, the ability to breathe more easily and see further has perhaps been the greatest consolation amid the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic. As city after city begins to emerge from lockdown, urban planners and environmental campaigners are grappling with how to keep the clean air and blue skies that have transformed our view of the world. “Citizens around the world can see change is possible,” says Zoe Chafe, an air quality specialist with the C40 group of global megacities. “Just put yourself on the rooftop and imagine seeing mountains for the first time, and thinking how amazing it feels to realise this is possible.” That rooftop could be in Kathmandu (where residents were astonished to make out Mount Everest for the first time in decades), Manila (where the Sierra Madre became visible again) or dozens of other cities across the world. Not everywhere has seen air quality improvements in recent months. In some Asian cities, such as Hanoi and Jakarta, pollution has become worse. But, for the most part, people across the world are experiencing a healthier alternative to the smoke and smog that are responsible for an estimated 3 million deaths a year. Having seen the shroud lift, there is a growing clamour not to let it fall again. Cities across the world are exploring ways to permanently reduce pollution. Chafe says there is no quick, one-case-fits-all solution, but there are lessons – on environmental justice, community activism, urban design, climate ambition, technological innovation and municipal leadership – that can be learned from the cities and states that were making progress even before the lockdown. Here are three. Copenhagen has the world’s most ambitious plan to cut emissions: carbon neutral by 2025. This is pushing the Danish capital to go beyond the existing model of smart, clean urban design and cycle-centred transport that has turned it into one of the cleanest cities in the world. Grassroots activism, pragmatic government and high taxes have been the drivers for change. Old photographs prove the city had as much of a car culture as any European city in the 1970s, when more than 100,000 citizens demonstrated in Rådhuspladsen (City Hall Square) to demand their streets back. Since then, town planners have steadily reduced parking spaces and widened areas for pedestrians and bicycles. Jeppe Juul, of the Danish Eco Council, says it is a question of priorities. “It feels good to walk around Copenhagen,” he says, adding that in some areas of the city “pedestrians have more space than bikes, and bikes have more space than cars.” The city now vies with Amsterdam for being the most bicycle-friendly city in the world. This means traffic lights with resting bars that riders can hang on to without touching the ground, take-away coffee containers designed for bikes, and groups that organise parent’s shifts for schools runs on “minibus-like” bicycles that can take up to six children at a time. Copenhagen’s 2025 target depends largely on replacing coal-fired heating with biomass, wind and geothermal energy. A new district-heating infrastructure will allow neighbourhoods to scrap home boilers. Urban planners aim to use carbon capture and storage technology to trap emissions from the main municipal waste incinerator. Some still doubt the city will be zero-carbon within five years, but Mikkel Krogsgaard Niss, from the mayor’s office, says sceptics have been proved wrong in the past. “From 2014-20, we reduced carbon dioxide by more than 50%, so we are on our way,” he says.  These shifts will create up to 35,000 jobs, with most of the money coming from public coffers. Residents already pay some of the highest rates of tax in the world, but this is seen as an investment in health and quality of life. The city’s wastewater plant was also expensive, but now that it is operational, residents can swim in the harbour – something unthinkable in urban waterways elsewhere. Danes are consistently ranked among the world’s healthiest and happiest people. The municipality also wants to completely phase out combustion engines by electrifying the bus fleet and banning petrol and diesel cars within five years. After that plan ran into opposition from the national government, local environmental NGOs lobbied for a revolutionary new traffic management scheme that hugely decreases the convenience of car use. The “distribution plan”, which was pioneered in the Belgian town of Ghent, divides the urban centre into a handful of zones and prohibits drivers from going directly from one to another. Instead, they have to go via the suburbs. “It means there is no such thing as a short drive to the bakery or wherever in this system,” says Jens Müller, the air quality manager of the Transport & Environment NGO. As a result, walking, cycling and public transport become more appealing. “It’s the most radical thing you can do apart from creating a no-car zone,” says Juul. Copenhagen is in a group of European cities, including Amsterdam, Paris, London and Oslo, that are trying to set the global pace for air quality improvements. Müller says London is a leader on ultra-low emission zones, Oslo on promoting use of electric cars, while Paris is exploring radical plans for “a city of 15 minutes” that aims to ensure every resident can get the shops and services they want within a short walk or bicycle ride. Cities in Germany are pioneering pop-up infrastructure and tactical urbanism that allow communities to block roads at certain times for certain events. In Brussels, residents now have a say in when to close roads for children’s parties and barbecues. Müller says this reduces pollution because people spend more time outside their homes. The foundation, he says, is community activism by previous and current generations. Amsterdam may now be aiming for zero-carbon boats and yet more bikes, but – like Copenhagen – the origins of its strong air-quality ambition was the parents’ movement in the 1970s, which campaigned against the number of road traffic accidents with banners demanding: “Stop murdering our children.” More recently, Madrid has seen a fierce political contest for control of the streets, with 20,000 people rallying last year to oppose plans by the ruling rightwing coalition to reopen the city centre to cars. The “Madrid Central” zone in the Spanish capital had achieved more nitrogen dioxide reductions than any city in Europe. So far, people power has kept the cars out. The importance of grassroots activism has recently been enshrined into law in California, where campaigners have persuaded the government that if it wants to improve air quality it needs to empower low-income BAME neighbourhoods, which are worst affected because they often live closest to pollution sources. California has made impressive strides since the 1980s, when Los Angeles, Oakland and San Jose were notorious for a toxic haze that blanketed the city for more than 200 days of the year. These days, thanks to tighter regulations, higher petrol standards and less reliance on coal, there are usually fewer pollutants in the air and about 60 more days of blue skies a year. Several cities have also launched “green new deals”. Even the car capital of the world, Los Angeles, is trying to nudge commuters on to an upgraded public transport system. But perhaps the most impressive work is being done at the community level by local activists in hotspots of pollution. The leading light in this initiative is Margaret Gordon, who has spent almost 30 years campaigning for environmental health and social justice in her West Oakland neighbourhood, a part of the San Francisco Bay Area that sits between two highways, a busy port, factories and the proposed site of a coal terminal. She first realised how badly her mostly black and Latino community was affected in 1992 when she started working part-time at a local school where she saw shoeboxes full of asthma inhalers, each with the name tag of a different child. “That was the start,” she recalls in a Zoom chat interrupted by her coughing. “After that, I went to a local meeting to express my righteous outrage about the conditions in the neighbourhood.” Gordon began monitoring the numbers of trucks that passed through on their way to the port. She later received training and funding to measure levels of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 that can enter the bloodstream and cause respiratory disease. Even inside her home, the readings were unhealthily high. She founded the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, and worked with scientists, who collected data to prove what she had long believed – that low-income minority communities are far more likely to suffer the ill effects of air pollution (later including higher vulnerability to Covid-19) than other sectors of society. The pressure has reaped results. The California Air Resources Board ordered the port to take action. There is now stricter regulation of trucks, the port has electrified its facilities and the planned coal terminal has been blocked. Air pollution is 74% lower than in 2008, according to the port. Gordon wants more. “The windowsills have gone from black to grey. But there is still a long way to go. We still have hotspots.” Her biggest achievement, however, may have been to help draft state law AB617, which passed in 2017 and put local communities at the centre of emissions reductions planning. West Oakland is now one of three Californian neighbourhoods that have drafted their own action plan for dealing with pollution sources. Air quality activists hope this will also address the tendency for wealthy white communities to go low carbon by offloading pollution towards poorer black and Latino areas. Of the two north-south highways in Oakland, it is no coincidence that trucks are banned only on the 580, which passes through a more affluent part of the city. Gordon says the goal is environmental equality. Among air quality wonks and urban planners, perhaps the greatest buzz of excitement is about Mexico City. The Latin American megalopolis was named the world’s most polluted capital in 1992, but it has since managed to improve air quality despite the pressures of an extra 5 million inhabitants. Today it has perhaps the most environmentally savvy mayor in the world. Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, the first woman to hold the office, is an energy scientist who won the Nobel peace prize in 2007 for her work on the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In a previous stint as the director of the city’s environment department, she oversaw the introduction of the Metrobus, a rapid-transit bus with dedicated lanes. Now she is aiming higher. Last year, she announced a six-year environmental plan, including a 30% cut in air pollution, a 40bn-peso (£1.5bn) modernisation of the metro and a campaign to plant 15m trees. Her government has banned the use of single-use plastic bags and plans to gradually phase out other single-use items, such as straws, cups and balloons. The city’s biggest challenge is traffic. Cars must be off the road for part of the week under the city’s widely replicated Hoy No Circula system, which restricts when vehicles can be on the road based on their number plates. But this has had mixed results because wealthier people simply buy more vehicles to get round the restrictions. The number of vehicles almost doubled between 2006 and 2016, and now account for about 70% of emissions and most nitrogen dioxide pollution in the metropolitan area. Previous administrations have lessened the impact by tightening gasoline standards, expanding monitoring and restricting access to the central corridor in the heart of the city. There are still dreadful smog spikes, particularly when forest fires in the surrounding hills add to exhaust fumes. Last year, the air was so unhealthy that the government closed schools, temporarily banned tens of thousands of cars from the road and forced professional football games to be rescheduled. But, overall, there have been long-term gains. Since 1988, ozone is down 46% and the amount of larger PM10 particles has fallen by 74%, according to Marco Balan, an adviser to the city’s air quality general director. “The view out of my window has improved,” he says. “But we have a long way to go.” Sheinbaum wants to go further by raising emissions standards for new vehicles, promoting use of hybrid and electric vehicles and investing more in the metro system, cleaner buses, light railways and cable cars so that people no longer have to rely on informal – and often dirty and overcrowded – minivans. Campaigners say a more important step would be to end fuel subsidies. Without that, the cycling scheme, known as EcoBici, will always seem like an afterthought and the Via Verde – a project to plant vertical gardens on the pillars of elevated roads – will inevitably be dismissed as window dressing. “Mexico City is a stunning example of air quality improvements,” says Chafe. “They are dealing with it in a holistic way. They know they have many sources and realise it has a huge impact on life expectancy and quality of life. The situation is not perfect, but they have made really impressive progress.” Building on that – here and elsewhere – will be the key after lockdown, she says. “We have seen an improvement in air quality in the past few months. It has been happening for the wrong reasons and in a sad situation. I hope we can now find a way to achieve the same results in a socially fair and feasible way.”"
"The US is far behind other industrialized nations on environmental performance and now ranks 24th in the world, according to a new analysis by Yale and Columbia universities.  Denmark came in first place, followed by Luxembourg and Switzerland. The United Kingdom ranked fourth.  The findings come as the Trump administration has continued to weaken environmental protections in a quest to relax rules on industry and expand fossil fuel development which threatens to put the country even further behind its peers. Donald Trump has called himself a “big believer in the environment” and insisted he wants “the cleanest water, the cleanest air” but in the Environmental Performance Index’s two-decade history, including during his presidency, the US has never risen to the top of the rankings.  “Countries that make an effort do better than those that don’t and the US right now is not making an effort. That shows up in a stagnation in the rankings where others are really seeing some significant improvements,” said Dan Esty, who directs the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy that co-produces the index.  The index ranks 180 countries on 32 performance indicators across 11 categories covering environmental health and ecosystem vitality.  The US is near the back of the pack for developed nations. China, which is plagued by poor air quality, has made investments that have helped it climb to 120th place, ahead of India’s 168th-place ranking. China is still a big polluter but has made “much more dramatic progress than other countries”, Esty said. The US ranked 15th on climate. It is currently the second-biggest contributor to the climate crisis, after China. Over time, it has put more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere than any other nation. But Trump has consistently questioned climate science and the severity of the problem. He has vowed to leave an international agreement to curb emissions, which the US joined under President Barack Obama. Other countries have also seen major changes in governance but are nonetheless doing well on climate, including the UK, which comes in second on the issue.  “If you look at Denmark, they’re doing great but they’re a tiny fraction of overall carbon emissions or greenhouse gas emissions broadly,” said Zach Wendling, lead researcher on the index. “The US is one of the top five players in every greenhouse gas, so we need to do better than just OK if we’re going to generate the best practices.” In particular, the US scored poorly on protecting water resources and managing its waste. On wastewater, the analysis considers how much of wastewater is treated before it is released into the environment and how much of the population is connected to a sewage system. The US is doing poorly on both counts. About half of trash generated in the US is unaccounted for, Wendling said. Thousands of different entities handle trash collection, and the Environmental Protection Agency does not have the resources to gather data about what is being recycled, incinerated or sent to landfills, he said.  Colombia, by comparison, has centralized collection and tracks all of its waste.  The US did better on air quality, ranking 16th, but the authors warned those rankings could fall as Trump officials have rescinded protections or declined to tighten them based on new research. "
"Vladimir Putin has ordered a state of emergency after 20,000 tonnes of diesel fuel spilled into a river inside the Arctic Circle. The spill occurred when a fuel reservoir at a power plant near the city of Norilsk collapsed on Friday. The plant is operated by a division of Nornickel, whose factories in the area have made the city one of the most heavily polluted places on Earth. During a video conference on Wednesday that was broadcasted on television, Putin lambasted the head of the Nornickel subsidiary that owns the power plant, NTEK, after officials said the company failed to report the incident. “Why did government agencies only find out about this two days after the fact? Are we going to learn about emergency situations from social media? Are you quite healthy over there?” the Russian president told Sergei Lipin, the head of NTEK. Nornickel said NTEK had reported what happened in a “timely and proper” way. The governor of the Krasnoyarsk region, where Norilsk is located, told Putin he only learned of the real situation on Sunday after “alarming information appeared in social media”. Putin said he agreed that a national state of emergency was needed in order to call in more resources for the cleanup effort. Russia’s investigative committee, which deals with major crimes, announced it had launched three criminal investigations into the accident and detained a power plant employee. Alexei Knizhnikov of the World Wildlife Fund said the environmental group was the one who alerted cleanup specialists after confirming the accident through its sources. “These are huge volumes,” he said. “It was difficult for them to cover it up.” The volume of the spill is vastly larger than the 2007 Kerch spill, which involved 5,000 tonnes of oil, Knizhnikov said. At the time the spill in the Black Sea strait was the largest of its kind for Russia and required intervention of the military and hundreds of volunteers. Knizhnikov said diesel fuel is lighter than oil, so it was likely to evaporate rather than sink but was also “more toxic to clean up”. The Ambarnaya River that bore the brunt of the spill will be difficult to clean up because it is too shallow to use barges and the remote location has no roads, officials told Putin. Russia’s environment minister, Dmitry Kobylkin, said he thought burning the fuel, which some are suggesting, was too risky. “It’s a very difficult situation. I can’t imagine burning so much fuel in an Arctic territory … such a huge bonfire over such an area will be a big problem.”"
"Raw sewage was discharged for more than 1,000 hours from a Thames Water overflow pipe into an environmental wetland at the Olympic Park last year, the Guardian can reveal. The combined sewer overflow (CSO) at Mulberry Court pumped untreated waste 91 times into the waterway that feeds into the River Lea. To April this year, the same CSO has so far discharged for 34 hours in 20 incidents. The area of wetlands in east London was created as part of the development of the Olympic Park. It was hailed as a legacy project to create a haven for plants, animals and insects for the public to enjoy. Dee O’Connell, a campaigner at the London Waterkeeper charity, tweeted live footage of one of the spills. Data obtained by the Guardian and London Waterkeeper, which is campaigning for a “Thames fit to swim in”, reveals the scale of the discharges that have been permitted by the Environment Agency. The sewage from the Mulberry Court CSO is discharged into a watercourse system in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park wetlands, which feed into the Lea. The data reveals the CSO discharged 91 times over 1,026 hours in 2019. On 30 September, untreated sewage was released into the wetlands for 49 hours. On 8 November, 90 hours of untreated sewage discharged from the overflow pipe. The Guardian revealed this week that more than 1.5m hours of untreated sewage was discharged into English rivers last year via CSOs. The data, obtained under environmental information requests, gives the most comprehensive picture of the scale of sewage discharges the Environment Agency allows water companies to carry out. Theo Thomas, the founder of London Waterkeeper, said: “The Olympic Park is the biggest urban park built in a generation. It was meant to be a legacy project but 1,000 hours of sewage was spilled last year into the wetlands. “This is a public park and what is happening is unacceptable in 2020. It shows a callous disregard for public spaces and our environment.” Thomas is campaigning with Surfers Against Sewage for water companies to stop releasing untreated sewage into rivers. Hugo Tagholm of Surfers Against Sewage said: “The health of our rivers is inextricably linked to the health of our ocean. Polluted rivers will always lead to a polluted ocean. We need connected and thriving aquatic ecosystems, free from sewage and pollution.” Feargal Sharkey, the Undertones lead singer and a keen fly fisherman, said the Environment Agency was complicit in allowing the pollution of rivers through storm overflows. “They know perfectly well what is going on. They have known about it for decades and refused to properly deal with the situation,” he said. The release of untreated sewage and waste water is permitted in extraordinary circumstances – such as extreme rainfall – to relieve pressure in the system. But critics say the Guardian’s data shows how routine sewage dumping in inland waters is. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: “The sewage system is designed to overflow to relieve pressure on the system – discharges from CSOs are not a sign that the system is faulty or being misused. “However, when companies do damage the environment, whether it is through polluting our waters or breaching permit conditions, we will take enforcement action against them including civil sanctions.” Thames Water said: “We have invested heavily in monitoring equipment to understand how frequently spills are made to the environment, and to better target investment in the best solutions. “Any discharge is undesirable but they only happen when there is literally no alternative and to prevent flooding to homes. It is the way the system is designed to operate.”"
"One of the joys of spring has been its shifting palette, the successive waves of colour that wash up on roadside verges: the early gold of dandelion and celandine, the purples of common honesty, bluebells and dog violets. Regal colours. Then, as those retired, the fields became awash in starlight: daisies, each a bright point of silver-white, as the blue pixels of forget-me-nots and speedwell glint from beneath the foaming cow parsley. Wildflowers enter one by one, as in a fugue – each taking up the same theme in a different key: a polyphony of petals. In this way, floral voices come together in vernal chorus before dying away. Down on the coastal path, I pinpoint the moment of transition from spring to summer to the blooming of the thrift. Last week was that time, here in the Northern Isles, as those tiny pom-pom heads burst forth in candyfloss colours, all along the salted shore. Thrift grows in short tufts, like licks of hair, sticking up at odd angles among the grasses and shrubs along the seafront. Some grow directly from the rocks themselves, finding toeholds in the cracks. Some share their beds with miniatures like scurvy grass – now past its best, its tiny white heads falling away to reveal taut green seed pods beneath. The cushion-like outcrops of thrift pile up along the shore, stippling the high tide line and coming together in soft mats further back. Sea pinks, to give them their other common name, and they are: powder pink and bubblegum, raspberry and pink lemonade. Dolce. As with the wildflowers, birdlife arrives and departs in carefully orchestrated arrangement. As the curlews and lapwings have fallen silent, the pipits and finches and stonechats have taken up the refrain. A few days ago, the great skuas arrived in concert. Known here as bonxies, they are the local heavies. They are dark and menacing, with a feline yowl, and swoop threateningly overhead. The bonxies – about the size of a herring gull, but bulkier – rough up the gulls until they sick up their lunch, then steal it. I’m fond of them, and their bullying ways. They are not fond of me. Listen: the song of summer is sounding. A complex melody that shifts in tone and key every day. Tread pianissimo upon the path so that you might hear it."
"The name Goyt valley may be pre-Celtic, but there isn’t much sense of the ancient here by day. The sounds of traffic are constant and it has been much visited in lockdown. Some of its history is also salted with tears. Two reservoirs – Fernilee in 1938, Errwood in 1967 – may have quenched Stockport’s thirst, but they drowned whole villages and triggered the closure of Errwood Hall, the home of the Grimshawes, who built it in 1830 on proceeds from Lancashire factories. The hall ruins are steeped in shadows from glorious old sessile oaks and some of the area’s largest sweet chestnuts. Infused further with willow warbler song, the walk is beautiful but haunted, although I confess that some of Goyt’s ghosts are mine. The Grimshawes filled the valley with rhododendrons and azaleas, whose invasive impact has been curtailed lately, but 50 years ago I’d visit here with my grandma, who loved the dusky-purple spectacular of their spring blossoms (she could also recall supplies delivered to the hall by coach and horse). As the last sunlight slanted down through the trees, I noticed how it illuminated a scintillating horde of mixed insects and sallow seeds billowing out in the valley. When all that detail was gone and the sky was just an ice-blue breast pinned by a cold new moon, the woodcocks came to “rode” across the treetops. These barrel-chested waders of the woods are among the most difficult birds in Britain to see well. Their plumage is the colour of earth or leaf litter, with barred black and silvery white detail. The default daytime habit is silence. Woodcocks sit and await dusk, then arise, circling the treetops in this weird, halting, bow-winged repeat display flight, when they emit a combination of frequent gnarly toad-like croaks and an intense high psssip sound . Neither noise betrays a woodcock’s location, and there is much whirling about and cupping of ears to fix its place. Just once I caught this exquisite clod of a bird low over my head and glimpsed the softest warm bracken of its breast. Two roding males, when their display circuits crossed, fenced one another with vigorous psssip notes, and that was my lot for four hours of waiting."
"Scientists and artists have used the drop in noise pollution during the coronavirus lockdown to create the first global public sound map of the spring dawn chorus. Throughout May, people around the world have uploaded about 3,000 early morning bird recordings made on their phones to the Dawn Chorus website, where they are being shared to help conservation and to create public art.  The soundscape project is inspired by the pioneering work of the bioacoustician Bernie Krause and is led by Prof Michael John Gorman, the founding director of the Biotopia museum in Munich, Germany.   Gorman said the idea was created rapidly after Covid-19 led to lockdowns around the world: “Suddenly the natural world could be heard more clearly. It is a moment to stop and listen, to record and share the unique acoustic fingerprint of the bird species of your local area.” Early results shared with the Guardian reveal diverse wild symphonies – a red-wattled lapwing chirps through a local lockdown in Pune, India, and in Munich an enchanting flute-like call of the golden oriole is heard sending his melody across a park – but they also document losses.  On the doorstep of Krause’s temporary home in Sonoma, California, a northern mocking bird and ashy-throated flycatcher greet sunrise. His previous home burned down in the 2017 wildfires, along with his 15,000 nature recordings, which luckily he had backed up. Krause, the author of The Great Animal Orchestra and founder of Wild Sanctuary, said: “Normally, the dawn chorus in this rural grape-growing agricultural area of northern California is populated with white crowned sparrows, song sparrows, juncos, California towhees and American robin. But the ongoing drought that began in 2011 and continues today, combined with the damage that the recent fires in our area have caused, seems, in combination, to have affected the vocal populations and the representative density and diversity. Our records indicate that spring now occurs two weeks earlier than 15 years ago.” Recordings from London show that the early rising birds start to perform in sequence. The first to start singing are blackbirds and robins, piping up at about 4.20am. Following them come woodpigeons, carrion crows, magpies and goldfinches, who in turn are followed by dunnocks, sparrows, blackcaps and parakeets. Meanwhile in Scarborough, squawking gulls conjure an evocative British seaside soundscape. “We hope to encourage people, even from windows and balconies, to make and share recordings of the dawn chorus at this exceptional and challenging time, when human activity is drastically reduced,” said Gorman. Dr Lisa Gill, who is analysing the results, said: “Some are simply beautiful: the golden oriole, the peacefulness of raindrops and blackbird song.” Listening to sound reveals a very different hierarchy to visual observation: “The blackbird and the great tit are the most frequent, but this is about where the similarity ends.” In Europe, the cuckoo, blackcap, wren and chiffchaff fly up the list. “Little brown birds are relatively difficult to spot and distinguish visually, but easily detected by ear – and who doesn’t know what the cuckoo sounds like?” said Gill. “I believe most people identify birds by vision, which, as we can see, really influences the outcome.” The project to capture the dawn chorus will be repeated annually and made available to the public to use in the creation of art and to help scientists monitor long-term changes in habitat quality and wildlife populations."
"Scientists and conservationists are calling for changes to Australia’s national environment law to urgently address failures in how it is protecting native wildlife, including bird species that have declined significantly over the past decade. Samantha Vine, the head of conservation at BirdLife Australia, says: “Our laws are actually allowing extinction to happen.”  With the Environment Protection and Biodiversity (EPBC) Act under review by the businessman Prof Graeme Samuel, environmentalists have pointed to several bird species as examples of the inadequate protection provided by the legislation. Pine plantations north of Perth are home to a population of the Carnaby’s black-cockatoo, a large, dark bird with white panels on its tail and cheeks. The species is listed as endangered under the EPBC Act and is found only in Western Australia. It’s estimated about 30,000 to 40,000 of the birds remain in the wild – at least a third of them in the Perth region – but it is under pressure because of continued habitat loss. Its main feeding habitat is banksia woodland, 70% of which has been cleared. In Perth, cockatoos adapted to this loss by moving into pine plantations that are cleared to fulfil timber contracts. The state government used to replant the pines but stopped in 1996 after discovering mature trees were intercepting rainfall and reducing the recharge of an important water resource for Perth, the Gnangara groundwater aquifer. Adam Peck, a black cockatoo project coordinator for BirdLife Australia, says the pines used to cover 23,000ha but are reduced to about 5,000ha and will be gone within three or four years. He says it is having a serious impact on the Carnaby’s black-cockatoo population. “Our research clearly shows that habitat clearance is leading to a decline in the Perth population and this will continue unless the government acts to revegetate the area,” Peck says. Every year BirdLife Australia runs the great cocky count, a citizen science survey. A decade of counting has found the Perth population of the Carnaby’s black-cockatoo has declined by 30%. BirdLife says it has legal advice suggesting harvesting the pine plantations is having a significant impact on the cockatoo under criteria laid out in the EPBC Act. But the clearing has not triggered an assessment under federal laws. The WA government argues the logging is exempt because it began before the laws were introduced. For years environmental advocates have sought federal assistance. They wrote to the former environment minister, Greg Hunt, back in 2014. But the federal environment department says while the government recognises the importance of the pine plantations to the cockatoos, the WA government “has put forward the view” that the clearing was lawful because it predated the legislation. Meanwhile, Peck says, the species is being pushed towards extinction: “I think it highlights that there are too many loopholes. We think the federal government should refer it [for assessment under the laws] and stand up to the state government and say you should do better than this.” The species is among a “forgotten flock” of birds at significant risk of extinction in the next two decades but attract only limited resources and attention. It is among a group of species, often described as “little brown birds”, which can be overlooked in favour of more charismatic, colourful animals. One of seven grasswren subspecies, the grey range thick-billed grasswren was thought to be extinct until it was found near White Cliffs, in north-west New South Wales, in 2008. “This little bird was rediscovered and pretty much nothing has happened,” says Jenny Lau, BirdLife Australia’s preventing extinctions program manager. “There was no follow-up surveys to find out where the birds were.”  In 2014 it was listed as critically endangered under national laws. In 2018 it was ranked number eight on a list of 20 Australian birds that a scientific study identified as the most likely to go extinct within the next 20 years. But like many endangered species the grasswren does not have a national recovery plan. Nor has a plan been legislated at state level. Recovery plans used to be mandatory for all species listed as threatened, but changes to the law in 2006 left registering a plan to the discretion of the minister. Most species are covered by a weaker document known as a conservation advice. A minister must not act inconsistently with a recovery plan when making decisions under the act, but there is no system for tracking what actions are being taken and nor is there a requirement for plans to be implemented. Several submissions to the review of the EPBC Act call for listing of a species to trigger clear requirements that governments must act to protect a species.  In the case of the grasswren, BirdLife Australia received funding from the NSW government to carry out basic surveys. It found additional birds in north-west NSW in areas covered by minerals exploration licences that have not been referred to the federal government for assessment. Andrew Black, an honorary research associate with the South Australian Museum who sits on a NSW advisory group on the grasswren, says: “Here we have a critically endangered bird. One would hope that would be taken very seriously and every effort would be made to ensure they’re looked after. “That’s sadly not the way the world works. The world doesn’t seem to care a great deal about biodiversity decline.” Dean Ingwersen, the chair of a recovery team for the critically endangered swift parrot and also woodlands bird program manager for BirdLife Australia, has watched as the outlook for the migratory bird has gone rapidly downhill. “The big failure comes from the fact that under the current laws it’s still possible to log the bird’s habitat,” Ingwersen says. Swift parrots are a unique species found nowhere else on the planet. The bright green and red birds breed in summer and spring in south-eastern Tasmania. After breeding, they migrate across Bass Strait and spend autumn and winter feeding on flowering gums along the NSW south coast before returning to Tasmania’s southern forest region to breed again. The parrot was first listed as endangered in 2000, just after the EPBC Act was introduced. It was upgraded to critically endangered in 2016, meaning it faces an extremely high risk of extinction. “We haven’t been able to turn it around,” Ingwersen says. The bird was selected by the federal government five years ago for inclusion in a “20 birds by 2020” plan, a strategy that was meant to improve the trajectory of nominated species. But the parrot’s plight has continued to worsen due to an exemption in Australia’s environment laws that makes it legal to log both its breeding habitat in Tasmania and its feeding habitat in NSW. The exemption applies to all areas covered by a regional forestry agreement, a bilateral agreement between states and territories. Forestry operations subject to an agreement do not have to be assessed under federal environment law for their impact on nationally listed threatened species. The consequence has been continued habitat loss, one of the key drivers of extinction. Ingwersen says the recovery team has worked hard across the swift parrot’s range to try to help it survive. It has conducted monitoring to gather data, worked with private landowners on habitat restoration, and invested in research to reduce the impact of sugar gliders, which prey on swift parrots. “It’s not an overreach to say a lot of that work is being undermined if we keep taking habitat out of the Tasmanian forests and out of the south coast forests in NSW where they feed,” he says. In Tasmania, researchers from the Australian National University examined forest loss from logging in important swift parrot breeding areas in the southern forest between 2007 and 2016. They found a third of the forest – 15,271ha – had been cleared. When they narrowed their research to hollow-bearing trees and the areas most likely to be used by swift parrots, they found 23% of the most suitable habitat had been cleared. Dejan Stojanovic, one of the researchers, says the exemption granted to forestry was “the big failing” of the EPBC Act. The extinction of the swift parrot is “inevitable” if it continues on its current path. “It’s a priority species and [the government is] actively seeking ways to address sugar glider predations, which is exacerbated by logging,” he says. “The fact it’s exempt is laughable.” This week the federal court made a landmark judgment in relation to forestry operations in the central highlands of Victoria. Justice Debra Mortimer ruled the Victorian state-owned forestry agency, VicForests, had breached the code of practice in its regional forestry agreement and, as a result, its exemption from national laws should not apply. Mortimer’s judgment found logging by VicForests was having a significant impact on the critically endangered Leadbeater’s possum and the vulnerable greater glider. Although the judgment applies only to the central highlands agreement, experts will be examining whether it could have implications for other agreements and the species they affect, including the swift parrot. In 2017 Tasmania’s agreement was rolled over for another 20 years."
"We are told we in England can now invite a limited number of guests for barbecues as lockdown restrictions are eased. There is little UK data on what this might mean for air pollution, but we do have evidence from Santiago, Chile. Between 2014 and 2016 the Chilean capital experienced record-breaking pollution events. Emergency traffic restrictions were imposed but the particle pollution quickly disappeared on its own. There was no unusual weather and no smoke from distant wildfires. Analysis of pollution ratios ruled out traffic and industry. The cause was a mystery. Then researchers checked sport schedules. The pollution peaked whenever the Chilean national football team played and people did not have work on the following day. The peaks could even be linked to the kick-off times. But they were not due to fans travelling to the stadium, they were caused by those who stayed at home. A survey before the final of the 2015 Copa América estimated that 29% of Santiago’s inhabitants planned a barbecue – around 100,000 fires lit at once. Many English councils have already asked people to refrain from bonfires and barbecues to prevent smoke from entering the homes of vulnerable neighbours. We are all mindful of 2-metre physical distancing, but the smoke from your barbecue will travel a lot further."
"A few weeks ago, my neighbours had cavity wall insulation installed and the resulting drill holes in their gable-end wall were soon being prospected by red mason bees (Osmia bicornis). People often assume that the common name of these gingery, spring-flying solitary bees refers to a tendency to nest in crumbling mortar, but it’s more likely to derive from their habit of using mud as a mortar-like material to line and partition their brood cells. While females do make use of crevices between old brickwork, they also nest in hollow plant stems and beetle boreholes in dead wood, and will readily occupy manmade bee hotels. Solitary bees seek out nesting sites in full sun, so as to maximise the chances of an artificial bee box being occupied, position is crucial. I hung one halfway up my south-facing garden wall and within an hour a female had begun scouting out the accommodation. Having selected a suitable bamboo cane, she flew off, returning with a globule of sticky mud in her jaws and disappearing into the far reaches of the hollow. When she arrived back at the nest after her next flight, her undercarriage was glowing gold. Unlike honey bees and bumblebees, which transport pollen in baskets on their hind legs, mason bees collect the grains on their scopa, a pad of densely packed specialised hairs on the underside of the abdomen. The bee entered the nest head-first to regurgitate nectar, backed out, spun round and reversed back in to brush off the pollen. This was the first of many foraging trips, the process repeated until she had deposited a pollen ball large enough to sustain a single larva. Adequate provisions provided, she laid an egg, capped the cell and set to work on the next chamber, breaking briefly to engage in an aerial tussle with an interloping female who, having taken possession of an adjacent cane, hovered too close to her neighbour’s entrance hole. The industrious little insect worked tirelessly until sundown, roosting overnight in the mouth of the tunnel. By late afternoon the following day, she had finished filling the tube and was sealing in her future progeny. Using her inward-curved facial horns, she tamped down mouthfuls of mud, smoothing it as it set to form a thick, protective plug."
"“TikTok tadpole influencer” is not a career path that Hannah McSorley would have been told about at school. In lockdown, however, with her GSCEs on hold, the 17-year-old has turned a time-honoured pastime – collecting frogspawn – into a potentially lucrative online empire. McSorley’s hypnotic daily videos of her tens of thousands of tadpoles have attracted 535,000 followers on TikTok as @.baby.frogs, leading to a deal with a US influencer agency. “I’m honestly amazed by the following I have,” she said. “It’s just the simple things: tadpoles, frogs. People find it fascinating.” A week into isolating with her family at their home in the countryside near Omagh in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, McSorley came upon a patch of frogspawn at risk of drying up in a shallow puddle. She took it home in a jar, thinking it could be an educational experience for her nine-year-old brother. Another clutch followed a week later, necessitating an upgrade in housing from one tub to two tubs, and now a paddling pool filled with plants and rocks.  “I always say there’s 37,928,” McSorley said. “I call it a generous estimate.” What was intended as a project to keep her busy during lockdown has sparked a TikTok sensation, with videos of McSorley tending to her writhing brood drawing hundreds of thousands of views and many requests for help. She has written her own how-to guide for those wishing to start their own “journey with tadpoles”. After extensive online research and consulting the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), McSorley began feeding her tadpoles boiled lettuce or spinach daily and changes their pool water fortnightly. “A good rule of thumb is four tadpoles per litre of water,” she writes, a large enough quantity to protect against losses. She has recorded three casualties in 72 days. “Unfortunately that’s just nature,” she said. “But they are remembered, and I do funerals for them.” Her heartfelt burial of one tadpole, named Fred, has attracted more than 1.8m views. McSorley says she was a TikTok skeptic before lockdown, watching more than she posted, “but then I found my niche of tadpole videos”. Her account has started a trend, with 34.6m views to the #tadpole hashtag across TikTok. The biggest account, @tadpolegirl, from the US, has nearly 900,000 followers. McSorley is interested in training as a vet, but also has plans to launch an educational YouTube channel in time to capitalise on frogspawn season early next year. In the meantime she has signed with the US influencer agency Markerly to grow her reach. McSorley believes the appeal of tadpoles is that they are “totally nonpolitical”, though she did pause posting on #blackouttuesday last week in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. “I find the tadpoles very peaceful to watch. People love the wholesomeness of my videos and their simplicity,” she said. “It’s just about tadpoles living their best lives.” Not for long though. The first tadpoles sprouted legs last week, suggesting to McSorley she has two or three weeks before she has a pool full of frogs. “Not the easiest thing to look after,” she said. Her followers had already expressed concern. One Twitter user said there would soon be one frog for every three people in Omagh, “straight from the book of Exodus”. One person who saw McSorley’s videos made an anonymous complaint to NIEA, who contacted her parents to discuss her intentions. “Honestly, my mum is the biggest fan of it all. She checks in on them before I do in the morning. She appears on my livestream sometimes.” McSorley already has a strategy for the emergence of the frogs. She plans to release them in batches in ponds and streams within a two-mile radius of her home, so as not to overwhelm any one area, though she notes that numbers are already down because of the unseasonably warm spring. “There aren’t as many frogs as people might think. It’s a very sad thing.Most of them will end up being eaten by birds, but some will come back to lay their eggs next year.” McSorley intends to be ready for them: “I’m really hoping my dad will build me a pond,” she said."
"Water companies in England discharged raw sewage into rivers on more than 200,000 occasions last year, according to data obtained by the Guardian. The analysis reveals untreated human waste was released into streams and rivers for more than 1.5m hours in 2019. The figures, obtained via environmental information requests, trace releases of sewage from storm drains in rivers across England by all nine water companies and provide a comprehensive picture of the scale of pollution from what critics say is the routine dumping of untreated sewage. Popular English rivers including the Thames, the Windrush, which runs through the Cotswolds and Oxfordshire, the River Chess, a chalk stream in Buckinghamshire, the Avon in Bristol, the Severn, and the River Wharfe in Ilkley are among the many affected. The data emerges as increasing numbers of people are using England’s rivers to swim, kayak and paddleboard. Countries are legally obliged to treat sewage before it is released into waterways. Discharges of untreated human waste are permitted only in “exceptional circumstances” for example after extreme rainfall, the European court of justice has ruled. But the scale of the sewage releases in 2019 reveals what one industry insider said was the frequent and routine nature of discharging untreated effluent from storm overflows. The source, who has worked in the industry for many years, said the discharges released “a horrible septic mix of nasties into the rivers”. He said the industry had for years ignored warnings about the growing scale of spills from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) – storm pipes that allow rainwater, untreated sewage and runoff to discharge into waterways. Recent scientific research has also raised concerns that Covid-19 can be carried into rivers via sewage discharges. Guardian data reveals 6,508 inland CSOs released untreated sewage into rivers 204,134 times in 2019. The spills discharged for 1.53m hours across the nine English water companies. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “Sewage discharges should take place only in the most extreme of circumstances. Regulation needs to be tightened to stop water companies using discharges as a day-to-day measure. “Customers will rightly be shocked at the frequency of sewage discharges and the damage it does to some of our country’s most precious and valuable river habitats.” The Environment Agency issues permits to allow water companies to release untreated human waste, which includes excrement, condoms and toilet paper, from CSOs after extreme weather events, such as torrential rain, to stop water backing up and flooding homes. More than 60 discharges a year from a storm overflow should trigger an investigation by the agency but the data reveals some storm overflows have released discharges hundreds of times. The Environment Agency relies on water companies to self-monitor their CSOs. Ashley Smith of the campaign group Windrush against Sewage Pollution said the system was little more than a “licence to pollute”. Smith, who monitors sewage spills on the River Windrush in Oxfordshire, said discharges happened after just a rain shower. He said: “The industry has been given a way to prop up failed infrastructure and it has exploited this enthusiastically. The inability of the Environment Agency to prosecute or even drive improvement has led us to where we are today – in a complete shambles with pollution rife and unchecked.” Michelle Walker of the Rivers Trust described the data as “very alarming”. The environmental charity worked with the Guardian’s data to create an interactive map where you can search for river discharges by area. She said: “When you look at the detail, you see that some of these locations are releasing untreated sewage hundreds of times a year, so they are not just operating during extreme rainstorms.” A recent study revealed the quantity of E coli coming out of CSOs was between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than that coming from treated sewage from wastewater treatment plants. Walker said: “People think our rivers should be fit to swim in but they don’t realise it is legal to discharge untreated raw sewage into our rivers.” Water companies say the spills are so diluted by rainwater and wastewater that they do not affect the quality of the water. Wessex Water said: “As CSOs should only operate during periods of intense rainfall, any foul water released from them will be very dilute … Rarely is a pollution incident attributed to a CSO operating correctly.” Water companies were told by the government to install monitoring on the majority of their combined sewer overflows by March 2020. But by June, the Guardian data reveals 3,400 out of about 10,000 inland outflows owned by the nine water companies still had no monitoring installed. Wessex Water has fitted monitoring devices to 495 of its 1,018 CSOs that can discharge into rivers and inland waters. Last year untreated sewage was released 13,876 times – more than twice as often as in 2018 – with a total duration over the year of 107,404 hours. South West Water has monitors on 410 of its 548 inland CSOs. In 2019, sewage was discharged from them 7,850 times over 36,149 hours. Yorkshire Water discharged untreated sewage from the 730 inland CSOs, which are monitored 22,906 times over 616,643 hours. Most of its 2,240 outflows into rivers are not fitted with monitors. Guardian data shows Southern Water released raw sewage into rivers last year 19,977 hours in 3,219 incidents. In March, the company separately pleaded guilty to 51 pollution charges over five years involving breaches of Environment Agency permits at treatment plants, which included 8,400 incidents of sewage escaping. Southern Water said: “Protecting rivers is a key part of [our] mission.” Severn Trent has fitted monitoring devices to 1,239 of its 2,897 inland CSOs. The monitored storm overflows discharged untreated sewage for 272,518 hours in 2019. The company said: “Since privatisation, Severn Trent has invested hundreds of millions of pounds in upgrading and maintaining our CSOs to achieve stringent river water-quality standards set by UK and European legislation.” Severn Trent said it had installed monitoring on more than 80% of CSOs. Dr Andrew Singer, a senior scientist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the pollution impact of CSO discharge was a risk to ecological and human health. “English rivers, even the Thames and the Severn, are relatively small, so the contribution of CSOs to many of our rivers can be extremely significant,” he said. “Rivers are much more likely to be impacted now by CSOs because of the increase in population density and the fact that the sewage system has not expanded to meet it.” Singer called for more transparency from water companies. A spokesperson for Wessex Water said: “In an ideal world there would not be a combined sewerage system, but many sewers were laid at a time when only one drain served a property – carrying both rainwater and sewage … Since 2000 we have invested £181m to upgrade more than 582 CSOs, and there are plans to improve more over the next five years.” The Environment Agency could not say whether any of the 1.5m hours of spills had led to an investigation. A spokesperson said: “The sewage system is designed to overflow to relieve pressure on the system – discharges from CSOs are not a sign the system is faulty or being misused. “However, when companies do damage the environment, whether it is through polluting our waters or breaching permit conditions, we will take enforcement action against them including civil sanctions.” The spokesperson said there was more to do to improve water quality, despite substantial improvements over the past two decades. “We have already secured a more robust and consistent approach for water and sewerage companies to monitor CSO spills.” A spokesperson for the industry body Water UK, said: “The water industry is committed to the very highest environmental standards … Although there is currently no simple and effective alternative to overflows, there are some innovative solutions being used, such as sustainable drainage systems, which are natural features that help keep rainwater out of the sewer. In new housing developments, these can help to take some of the pressure off the sewer network.”  Visit an interactive map, created by the Rivers Trust with the Guardian’s data, where you can search discharges in your area."
"More than 30 shorebird species that fly across oceans each year to visit Australia – including nine that are threatened – are being hunted during their long migrations, according to a study that analysed decades of records from 14 countries. The study, which experts said filled a major gap in the world’s knowledge about the impact of hunting on declining shorebird numbers, found that more than 17,000 birds from 16 species were likely being killed at just three sites – Pattani Bay in Thailand, West Java in Indonesia and the Yangtze River delta in China. Prof Richard Fuller, a co-author on the study, said that figure was “terrifying”. “We know hunting is going on at hundreds of other sites around the flyway. It’s highly likely that unsustainable hunting levels are being executed for many species,” Fuller said. All the birds use the East-Asian-Australasian Flyway – one of nine recognised migratory routes around the globe. Two species – the far eastern curlew and the great knot – are listed as critically endangered under Australia’s environmental law. Great knots breed in the high Arctic and far eastern curlews in south-east Russia and north-east China – all more than 10,000km from their summer layovers in Australia. Eduardo Gallo-Cajiao, a researcher at the University of Queensland, coordinated the study, which took five years to complete and appears in the Biological Conservation journal. More than 100 logbooks, newsletters, citizen science projects, academic studies and “dusty old technical reports” going back to 1970 were gathered from 14 countries. “We knew since the 1980s that hunting was still going on, but there was an idea that hunting wasn’t really a concern. It has gone under the radar for a long time,” Gallo-Cajiao said. “Because these birds fly across vast areas, hunting needs to be measured and monitored considering the cumulative levels of hunting at various places throughout the region. “Up to now, all we had was bits and pieces of data on hunting from different individual sites, but nobody had pooled them together to get a better picture. It was just like assembling a jigsaw puzzle.” He said the only place where hunting records came from regulated activity was in the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta in Alaska, where indigenous people hunted bar-tailed godwits for food. Much of the remaining hunting along the flyway – which stretches across 22 countries and Taiwan – was unregulated and likely illegal, he said. Some 61 species were being affected, 37 of which were seen on Australian shorelines. Migrating shorebirds tend to gather in high concentrations to rest and feed as they make their long migrations, making them predictable and easy to hunt. As recently as 2019, there was evidence that far eastern curlews were being shot in the Kamchatka peninsula in eastern Russia as they gathered among larger flocks of whimbrels. The study found there was a lack of coordinated monitoring along the flyway, despite at least 12 of the 61 species appearing on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species. “We need to have a conversation among the many countries in the flyway,” Gallo-Cajiao said. Two taskforces have been formed to look at hunting impacts – one as part of a voluntary organisation of countries covered by the flyway and another under the UN’s convention on migratory species. “Hunting is a hidden threat that we’ve known about, but haven’t been able to quantify just how big the problem is,” Fuller said. Birds were being hunted for subsistence, he said, as well as to trade for food. Shorebird numbers are declining and Fuller said developments around the Yellow Sea – where many of the migrating birds stop to rest – had robbed them of about two-thirds of the intertidal mud-flats over the past 50 years. Far eastern curlew numbers had crashed by about 80% in the past 30 years, he said, and the species was listed as critically endangered in Australia in 2015. He said the hunting records were still too sparse to be confident of the impact on the shorebirds, but at least three-quarters of the 61 species that use the flyway were likely being hunted. Other hunted shorebirds that visit Australia and that appear on an international list of vulnerable species are the bar-tailed godwit, black-tailed godwit, red knot, curlew sandpiper, red-necked stint, Asian dowitcher and grey-tailed tattler. Prof Richard Kingsford, a UNSW ecologist who coordinates an annual waterbird survey, said: “This study has filled a major gap. “It’s great that we are getting a handle on this issue, but it’s not a good story. We know these birds are in trouble anyway, so this is a big concern.” Dr Steve Klose, manager of the migratory shorebird program at BirdLife Australia, said the flyway could be seen like a pipeline and potential “leaks” from hunting had “moved into focus” in the past two years. “We can see that the flow to Australia is diminishing and we have suspicions that there are holes somewhere. We know populations are going down and we are heading for extinctions,” he said."
"Hundreds of renewable energy projects may be asked to turn off this weekend to avoid overloading the grid as the UK’s electricity demand plummets to record lows. Britain’s demand for electricity is forecast to tumble to a fifth below normal levels due to the spring bank holiday and the shutdown of shops, bars and restaurants mandated by the coronavirus lockdown. National Grid is braced for electricity demand to fall to 15.6GW on Saturday afternoon – a level usually associated with the middle of the night – and continue to drop even lower in the early hours of Sunday morning. Meanwhile, the sunny weather is expected to generate more renewable electricity than the UK needs. “Bank holidays see reduced demand for electricity, and even more so with the current lockdown measures in place,” said Amy Weltevreden, a manager at the energy system operator. The National Grid control room plans to use a new scheme this weekend that will pay small wind turbines and solar installations to stop generating electricity if the UK’s renewable energy sources threaten to overwhelm the energy system. About 170 small-scale renewable energy generators have signed up to the scheme, with a total capacity of 2.4GW. This includes 1.5GW of wind power and 700MW of solar energy. Other companies have also signed up to boost their electricity use when demand falls too low. “If we’re anticipating the wind blowing at a given time when we’re also expecting low demand, we’re now able to instruct these smaller-scale distributed generators to reduce output to help balance the system,” Weltevreden said. “Much of the renewable electricity generated in Great Britain comes from these smaller units – what we call distributed or embedded generation. Because they’re not connected directly to our transmission system, in the past we haven’t had as much ability to control the power they’re producing to balance the grid.” National Grid warned last month that the low demand for electricity could mean that renewable energy is turned off to avoid overloading the grid with more electricity than the UK can use. Roisin Quinn, head of National Grid’s control room, said: “The assumption will be that lower demand makes it easier for us to do our job, with less power needed overall and therefore less stress on the system. In fact, as system operator, it’s just as important for us to manage lower demand for electricity as it is to manage the peaks.” Electricity demand fell to record lows of 15.2GW over the Easter weekend, well below National Grid’s forecast lows of 17.6GW for this summer."
"At first it was a mystery – short vertical lines scratched into the wooden panelling on the side of the veranda, like days counted off by a prisoner. The shallow furrows, each several centimetres from top to bottom, covered the bare boards. Some of the marks were dry and old; others appeared to have been scored into the weathered timber more recently. Sitting outside on a still, quiet day I heard a faint rhythmic scraping sound and inspected the outside of the slats. There at the centre was a wasp, gnawing at the wood and slowly working its way downwards. Beneath its jaws it rolled the fibres into a neat ball as it went, finally tearing off the strip before flying away, leaving a fresh groove among the parallel lines on the panels. Our familiar black-and-yellow wasps that live in large colonies use wood pulp to create fragile paper nests in which they rear young. Every spring, lone queens that have hibernated over winter begin the process from scratch, raising a new generation that will help with the work until the colony eventually disbands in the autumn. When the insect returned, I was able to identify it from its smart lemon bands as a queen tree wasp (Dolichovespula sylvestris), one of nine social wasp species resident in Britain. It was impossible to follow its flight path through a neighbouring copse, but somewhere not too far away it would be building a nest among branches, at ground level or perhaps hidden under roof eaves. Another carpenter joined it on site, only this bulkier companion – around 2cm long – lacked the hi-vis yellow jacket. Its colouring was a dull gold, with brown markings on the thorax resembling those of a hornet. I turned to the entomologist Steven Falk for help with identification, and it turned out to be the French wasp (Dolichovespula media), which he first identified as a new UK colonist in the 1980s. Since then it has spread widely across England, typically constructing its football-sized nests in trees and shrubs. They may be unpopular, bothering picnickers and besieging beer gardens, but wasps play a vital role in pest control and pollination. I was happy to leave my visitors to their labours, adding their marks to the myriad lines of previous generations etched into the ageing veranda boards."
"Kashmiri goats (Capra markhor) provided much-needed light relief and an inspiration for cartoonists when they were filmed strolling through a seemingly deserted Llandudno in north Wales during lockdown. They grazed on privet hedges and nibbled prized garden plants. The species – originally brought to Britain to launch a cashmere shawl industry, which took off when Queen Victoria kept a large herd at Windsor – was released on Great Orme, which towers over Llandudno, just over a century ago. A landowner had decided they were unsuitable park animals, possibly because of their powerful odour. They still behave like the mountain goats they are. The agile mothers leave their kids safe from predators on tiny ledges, returning regularly to suckle them. When the kids are old enough they are led to join the rest of the herd. The goats are mostly inconspicuous, moving away from inquisitive tourists and fading into the hillside vegetation. In normal times, if they do come down from the hills, residents fear bad weather – the coincidence happening often enough to give the theory credence. Attempts to cull them have led to fierce resistance and a resultant study has revealed that isolation has led the herd to have distinctive characteristics, creating a subspecies worth preserving."
"Dark basalt is the core of the Belfast Hills that loom over the city’s north-west. The bedrock has seeped into the names of its heights: Divis (from the Irish dubhais, meaning “black back”) and the Black Mountain. These form a sweep of moorland that was out of bounds for the decades that it was controlled by the Ministry of Defence. Although now under the care of the National Trust, an atmosphere of surveillance lingers in the huge telecommunications masts commanding the peaks. Arriving for my first visit after lockdown, I feel a flutter of trespass. The buffeting wind settles my stride. To my right are the distant Mournes and, over my shoulder, a narrow sidle of Lough Neagh. But these are just openers. On a better day than this – cloud-mottled sky, squally showers threatening – I might stare over to Cumbria. Ahead are marked trails overlaid on ancient desire paths through bleak grandeur, and it’s treacherous underfoot. Near prehistoric cairns, a meadow pipit stutters up into its flight song. From the ridge trail, through dips and climbs, with skylarks wheedling above, my attention roves from the expansive to the particular. A heather-brown hillside scarred by long-abandoned lazy beds. Hardy cattle following a millennium-old tradition of summer grazing. The eerie thrum of a snipe. Flecks of bog cotton, ragged robin and delicate inflorescences of the common spotted orchid. Along damp runnels, tiny blue stars: water speedwell, creeping forget-me-not. Such details are dismissed on Black Mountain’s spine. My eyes are greedy for this view. Beyond a miniaturised city, the Ards peninsula rims the silver burnish of Strangford Lough. Further on, Belfast Lough gapes to a vague horizon that blurs Scotland. Below my gaze, swifts scythe the air, some swerving so close to my legs that I hear their wings’ swish. The trigonometry point sets the turn for Divis. I eschew the stone-pitched way to the summit for the less-frequented heath trail, a soft track around the western flank. Here, the expanse of bogland falls into the plain of mid-Ulster, a patchwork that stretches from the Antrim plateau to the Sperrins to the broad reveal of Lough Neagh, and then dissolves into the haze fading towards Donegal. My gaze owns it all. I stand and breathe."
"Covered in polka dots and stretching the length of a single-decker bus, the gentle giant barrelled towards them. The team of scientists, ready with a 17kg waterproof ultrasound machine they had lugged to one of the world’s most isolated dives sites, waited for the whale shark. Months of preparation had gone into the encounter, expected to last between 30 and 45 seconds. Aided into position by a propeller mounted on his air tank, one scientist glided underneath the hulking animal as it swam by, raking a handheld probe across her distended belly – yielding the world’s first ultrasound of a wild whale shark. The ultrasounds, carried out in 2018 on three females off the Galápagos Islands, were aimed at teasing apart one of the ocean’s greatest mysteries: decades after research began in earnest on whale sharks, scientists have few clues as to how they mate or where they give birth. “Here is the biggest fish in the oceans, it’s almost certainly the biggest shark,” says Jonathan R Green, the director of the Galapagos Whale Shark Project. “And what is known about their reproductive behaviour is almost nothing.” For more than 70m years, some form of the whale shark has roamed the oceans, their existence overlapping with the Tyrannosaurus rex at one point. A docile filter-feeder, the whale shark challenges the stereotype of sharks as giant, toothy predators. Its 300 of rows of teeth are microscopic, it moves through the water at a relatively plodding pace and has been known to allow phalanxes of other fish to hitch a ride. Still, whale sharks have proven to be just as headline-grabbing as their fearsome relatives. Researchers in Japan recently discovered that they have retractable eyes, with the eye surface around the iris covered in nearly 3,000 tiny tooth-like structures known as “dermal denticles”, while another research team documented thousands of shrimp-like creatures living in the mouth of one whale shark. “There are few things today on our planet that you can say, ‘that is absolutely new to science, we didn’t know that before’,” says Green. “So it’s a bit like the discovery of gravity – it’s an exciting field to work in, but it can be frustrating too.” Green and his team carried out the ultrasounds after noticing that the whale sharks that gather off the Galápagos were nearly all females with swollen bellies, in contrast to the large gatherings of mostly juvenile males in coastal regions around the world. While the ultrasounds didn’t confirm the whale sharks were pregnant, they did reveal ovaries and what appeared to be unfertilised eggs, hinting that more research is needed to untangle the significance of the area to whale shark reproduction. Green and his team also tagged several of the animals, only to find out that they often dive beyond the 2,000-metre range of the tags. He and his team have been at pains to explain this “spiralling behaviour”, as the deep water dives seemingly confer little advantage in escaping predators, birthing pups or finding the plankton that whale sharks mostly feed on. “So it’s layer upon layer of mystery that we’re trying to peel our way through,” says Green. “And every time we come up with some kind of significant data, it just begs a whole series of new questions.” These questions have taken on new urgency in recent years. “Every day there are fewer of them,” says Green. “We’re losing these animals at a rate which is unprecedented in the history of planet Earth, perhaps with the exception of the Cretaceous-Tertiary K-T mass extinction, when the dinosaurs were wiped out.” Whale sharks were listed as endangered in 2016, their survival imperilled by fisheries, where they turn up as by-catch, and the demand for shark fins in Asia – with a single pectoral fin able to net as much as $20,000 (£16,000). The search for answers, however, has in part been stymied by the technical challenges of tracking an animal that ranks among the ocean’s most widely travelled, shifting between open ocean, coastal areas and the deep sea. A 2018 study on a whale shark named Anne saw her travel more than 12,500 miles across the Pacific over the span of two years and three months, at one point making her way to the Mariana Trench – the deepest place on Earth. The glaring gaps in our knowledge about the world’s biggest fish, however, also reflect our priorities as a society, says Green. “We’ve literally shown more interest in exploring outer space than we have the depths of our oceans.” Scientists are now locked in a race against time. “How can you have an informed conservation plan for an animal if you don’t know how, when or where it breeds?” asked Alistair Dove, the vice-president of research and conservation at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, US. The aquarium is home to four juvenile whale sharks that have yet to reach sexual maturity. In the wild, once whale sharks are born, little is known about the first years of their lives, he says. “There’s a sort of lost years period, between when they’re born at about 45–60cm long, until they’re up to about 3–4 metres long. That period in between there, we don’t know where they are.” Tantalising clues have turned up around the world. A pregnant female harpooned by a commercial fishing vessel in Taiwan in 1995 was found to be carrying more than 300 pups in different stages of development. Analyses carried out years later allowed researchers to determine that 29 pups still remaining from the litter all had the same father, suggesting whale sharks mate once, store the sperm and fertilise their own eggs as needed, says Jennifer Schmidt, the director of science and research for the Shark Research Institute. A 2019 video, shot by a pilot flying over the Ningaloo reef in Western Australia, showed an adult male whale shark swimming erratically, zigzagging through the water as it seemingly vied for the attention of a nearby female. Then it flipped upside down, underneath the female, brandishing his two claspers – the name given to the male’s penis-like organs. While some celebrated the video as a mating act caught on camera, it’s clear that the female was too young to breed, says Schmidt. “You’ve got a juvenile with an adult – it could be some sort of mating play behaviour, some sort of practice, but it’s not a bona fide mating event because one of the sharks is not old enough to be reproductive,” she added. Over the years, two eyewitness reports of mating have been documented, both of them from the far-flung island of St Helena in the south Atlantic. Unaware of each other’s reports, two men described the same ritual: splashing that gave way to the male and female in vertical positions – belly to belly – before the female ended up on top and the male slipped underneath her. The reports were bolstered by the fact that the waters off the volcanic island are one of the few places in the world where adult male and female whale sharks have been spotted in equal numbers. “I have no doubt they both saw whale shark mating,” says Dove of the Georgia Aquarium, who travelled to St Helena after hearing of the reports. “We just don’t have that thing that everybody expects in the 21st century, which is if you didn’t get it on video, it didn’t happen.” In the absence of hard evidence, he and other scientists are pushing forward, determined to uncover the secrets that have surrounded whale sharks for millions of years. “The ocean holds on to her secrets pretty tightly,” says Dove. “It’s frustrating to me, as a marine biologist, that we can have this enormous animal and know so little about it,” he adds. “The whale shark is now endangered. And we can’t expect to pull it back from that situation if we don’t understand how that life history works.”Share your thoughts and experiences using the hashtag #sharklife on Twitter and Instagram, and follow our shark series at Guardian Seascape: the state of our oceans"
"On the north coast of New South Wales, two traditional enemies have put aside their longstanding differences for a common goal: dolphins. As the impact of coronavirus has hit the Dolphin Marine Conservation Park in Coffs Harbour, the zoo’s owners and animal rights advocates have come together to propose a radical plan – housing the animals in a semi-open sea enclosure. Under a proposal from the marine park, the group Action for Dolphins and World Animal Protection, the zoo’s dolphins will be released from their concrete pools and live into a sectioned-off area of the Coffs Harbour marina. Terry Goodall, the managing director of the Dolphin Marine Conservation Park, said it was like “polar opposites working together”. Jordan Sosnowski, advocacy director of Action for Dolphins, said it was a “very unique collaboration” between the marine park, and her group, which opposes keeping animals in captivity. “I don’t think there’s anything like it anywhere else in the world,” she said. “They were our nemeses in the past,” Goodall told Guardian Australia. “Now we are holding hands and walking down the road together, trying to solve the problem. It’s just a complete and utter turnaround. We don’t agree on everything, but we agree on the wellbeing of the dolphins.” The marine park currently houses three bottlenose dolphins: Zippy 32, Bella, 15, and Jet, 11, and it has been hit hard by closures enforced by Covid-19 restrictions. Because all three have been raised solely in captivity, they cannot survive in the wild, Goodall said. After becoming manager of the park in August 2018, Goodall said he spoke to Sosnowski, who proposed the idea of the open sea enclosure. This would give the dolphins 10 times the space they currently have, and visitors would be able to see them in the marina. “We have had a long-running battle with them over the past few years, quite a few years in fact. When I came on board, I met with Jordan from Action for Dolphins. I invited her in, and we just sat down talking. “They had always wanted the dolphins released back into the wild. I said they simply can’t be released back into the wild. They had never seen a shark. So they wouldn’t last two minutes … Ideally, they would be wild in the ocean, but they can’t be, so the sea sanctuary is the next best option.” Sosnowski agreed the dolphins could not be safely released into the wild because they didn’t have the necessary skills needed to survive. “A sea sanctuary is a humane compromise which will allow the animals to live in the ocean and have a lot more autonomy, whilst still ensuring they are looked after and fed by caregivers,” Sosnowski said. Together, the groups have been approaching the government for funding, and promoting the benefits of the idea. He said that as well as being a tourist attraction, the enclosure could act as a “halfway house” for the rehabilitation of stranded wild dolphins or whales. “This little park generates something like $15m a year into the local economy,” he said. “So we don’t want to lose it.” “A sea sanctuary like this one has huge potential for the city of Coffs Harbour, providing much-needed jobs in the aftermath of the pandemic, boosting tourism and most importantly, providing a better life for the dolphins,” Sosnowski said. And as they wait, the dolphins have been missing their human visitors during Covid-19, Goodall said. “They do like human interaction. Far be it for me to more anthropomorphic about this, but you can see it. They swim around looking out of the pool all the time. They have balls they play with – they throw them out, expecting people to throw them back in. They end up playing ball with themselves.” The unlikely allies have made several approaches to the local federal MP Pat Conaghan, the state MP Gurmesh Singh and the local council. “You have got to build the breakwalls, you have to build the nets – so we are probably talking $9m to $10m,” Goodall said. “We are probably going to end up putting a Go Fund Me program together.” But both the park and the activists are determined to push ahead. “We can’t release them into the wild because it would be a death sentence, so what other options are there?” Goodall said. “Nobody wants to see them swimming around in concrete lagoons. Whilst it is expensive, and politically fraught, it is a solution. And it’s a bloody good one.”"
"It took Moufida and John Holubeshen just a day of tracing alleged sightings and studying map coordinates before the two amateur detectives found their target. “We did the whole CSI thing,” says Moufida. “Plotting points and drawing lines, searching for where the middle of the circle – the nest – would be.” The couple, like hundreds of other beekeepers in western Canada and the US, were hunting the Asian giant hornet, an invasive species whose stealthy advance throughout British Columbia and Washington state is causing growing unease. Scientists and apiarists fear that, if permitted to spread unchecked, the hornets, which feast on honeybee larvae, could have disastrous consequences for tens of thousands of hives. The couple’s investigation began last September, when word spread that hornets had been spotted on the outskirts of the city of Nanaimo where they live. Concerned for the safety of their four hives, they set out one evening towards the suspected nest location in a city park. As they walked along the trail, they heard a low, rumbling buzz overhead. Moments later John felt a sharp pain in his chest. He had just become one of the first people to be stung by a giant hornet in North America. “It was like being hit by a two-by-four,” he says. “It felt more like a bruised rib than a sting.” They fled the scene – but soon realised they would have to return. “My first thought was I’ve got to go back and get a sample or a photo because nobody’s going to believe us,” he says. “It just seemed so surreal.” As the hornet continues to spread into the Pacific northwest, government officials and local beekeepers have swapped tending hives for sleuthing: experimenting with homemade contraptions and deploying sophisticated electronics to trace the hornet’s spread – and hoping to save hundreds of thousands of honeybees in the process. Since the first hornet was spotted, British Columbia’s chief beekeeper, Paul van Westerndorp, has been keeping a growing list of sightings. So far, the hornets have been seen in the cities of Nanaimo, White Rock and Langley. He is well aware of the threat they pose, but still Van Westerndorp holds a deep admiration for his adversary. “I look at this animal closely and it’s fascinating. Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder – but it’s an incredible piece of engineering,” he says. The Asian giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia, is built to dominate an ecosystem: its massive orange head is equipped with sharp jaws to slice through prey. When its wings flap, they sound more like a hummingbird than a wasp. After their encounter in the park, the Holubeshens returned to the nest later that night, accompanied by entomologist Conrad Bérubé and Peter Lange, president of the local beekeepers’ club. Bérubé eradicated the subterranean hive, receiving several painful stings through his protective layers in the process. But while the Nanaimo beachhead was successfully destroyed, the hornets’ incursion continues. “It’s like seeing an incoming storm and battening down the hatches. But we don’t know how strong these winds are going to be,” says Susan Cormier, who, with her partner, keeps 17 hives containing about 850,000 honeybees. Two months ago, a giant hornet was spotted nine blocks from their home in Langley, British Columbia – a city near the US border. “We’re trying our best not to panic.” Genetic analysis of captured hornets suggests at least one came from South Korea, another from Japan. Until August 2019, no specimen had ever been spotted in Canada. And nearly a year later, no one is quite sure how they made the journey across the Pacific. Most freight shipped across the Pacific is fumigated with carbon dioxide upon arrival to kill insects. But some cargo, such as automobiles, could provide refuge, says Van Westendorp. Others believe the hornets arrive as stowaways in oil tankers or in shipments of flower pots. “All it needs is a tiny little space, essentially the size of its body,” says Moufida. As the sightings have increased across the region, the media has stoked fear over an impending “murder hornet” invasion. The hornet has been known to kill people with its venom, but experts agree that the risk to the human population is low. “Most negative interactions are from people unwittingly stepping on the nests – not predatory attacks,” says Van Westendorp. While the hornets pose relatively little threat to humans, they have an insatiable appetite for honeybees and are capable of destroying entire hives. As summer nears, more drone hornets are expected to emerge from the subterranean nests. Scouts are dispatched to look for bee colonies, marking their location with a distinct pheromone before returning with an assault party, often weeks later. The tactics are ruthlessly efficient: a group of 30 hornets can decapitate tens of thousands of bees in only a few hours. “They stand at the entrance and create a massive panic in that colony, slicing the bees with their huge mandibles,” says Van Westerndorp. Amid the panic, hornets will enter the nest and pull out honeybee broods to take home as “meatballs”. Japanese honeybees have developed a defence, vibrating their bodies as they pile on to the invading hornet to cook it alive. But honeybees in North America are defenceless. To prevent a massacre, plans have been forged months in advance. Queen hornets briefly emerge in spring to find a nesting site, providing a narrow window in which they can be trapped, thereby preventing the development of a full-on nest. This spring, however, none of the sticky glue traps laid out by the province and beekeeping clubs worked, says Van Westerndorp. Still, scientists in British Columbia remain optimistic. They are using bottle traps in the hope of catching live specimens which will be tagged with small radio transmitters and followed back to the nest which can then be eradicated. Other plans include fastening a bright, thin strip of plastic ribbon to the torso of a hornet, letting the shimmering material guide beekeepers back to the nest. US beekeepers are also looking into infrared cameras that can detect the hornet. The idea has potential, says Van Westerndorp, but he admits the technology is so far “unproven”. Instead, beekeepers have started using low-tech approaches, modifying their hives in preparation for the summer. “My husband has been building little screened entrances in front of our hives to try to prevent the hornets from getting in, but still allow the bees to get out,” says Cormier. “The problem is, we can’t find accurate information on how fat the Asian giant hornet is. How long is it? How big of a hole can it get into?” For scientists and beekeepers alike, the big question is: how bad will the onslaught be? “Maybe we’ll keep them down to a dull roar. Maybe they’ll be one of those invasive species that absolutely loves Canada and our ecosystem,” Cormier says, acknowledging the unfolding invasion is defined more by uncertainty than fear. “But nature is bigger than us. So we’ll just do what we can.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"A plan to release a horde of 750 million genetically modified mosquitoes in Florida and Texas is a step closer to fruition after a state regulator approved the idea, over the objections of many environmentalists. Oxitec, a British-based biotechnology company, has targeted the US as a test site for a special version of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The mosquitoes contain a protein that, when passed down to female offspring, will kill them and, it is hoped, prevent them from biting people and spreading diseases such as dengue fever and Zika. On Tuesday, it was announced that the Florida department of agriculture and consumer services has given the green light to a plan to release the millions of mosquitoes in the Florida Keys, the string of picturesque islands that extend from the southern tip of the state, beginning this summer. Last month, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also approved the Florida plan, as well as a further trial next year that will take place in Harris county in Texas, which includes Houston. Proponents of the trial say that as only modified male mosquitoes, which do not bite people, will be released, there will be no danger to the public. But the plan has caused uproar among conservation groups, which have said they intend to sue the EPA for allegedly failing to ascertain the environmental impact of the scheme. Scientists have also expressed concerns about the oversight of the trial. On Tuesday, opponents of the plan rallied outside the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District office, which has to deal with more than 40 species of mosquito in the region, to demand its board oppose the trial. The plan is a “Jurassic Park experiment”, said Jaydee Hanson, policy director for the International Center for Technology Assessment and Center for Food Safety. “What could possibly go wrong? We don’t know, because they unlawfully refused to seriously analyze environmental risks.” Barry Wray, executive director of the Florida Keys Environmental Coalition added: “People here in Florida do not consent to the genetically engineered mosquitoes or to being human experiments.” Mosquitoes have long plagued people in the marsh-rich Florida environment. Native Americans used to ward the biters off with smoke or simply bury themselves in the sand to avoid them, while early white settlers slathered themselves in bear fat or burned oily rags. More recently, authorities have conducted mass spraying of mosquito habitat with insecticides that have been linked to the deaths of non-target insects, such as bees."
"After a two-week chase through Lopé-Okanda national park, a mosaic of rainforest and savannah in central Gabon, David Lehmann and his Wildlife Capture Unit were celebrating – they had caught a giant pangolin nicknamed Ghost, the biggest on record. The team – consisting of eco-guards, an indigenous tracker, a field biologist and a wildlife vet – hope that Ghost, who weighs 38kg and measures 1.72m from nose to tail, will give valuable insights in their fight against poaching.  A nocturnal lifestyle and the fact that it feels most at home in a complex system of deep inaccessible burrows makes the giant ground pangolin – Smutsia gigantea – one of the least researched species in the animal kingdom. “We know little about their basic ecology, their movements and population sizes, and our lack of knowledge hinders our efforts to protect them,” says Lehmann, a wildlife ecologist. His research is part of the EU’s Ecofac6 programme, a commitment that started in the 1990s to safeguard biodiversity in the Congo basin. “What we are doing here is pioneering work,” he says. The only scaly mammal in the world, a pangolin’s body is covered with razor-sharp, overlapping keratin plates. When attacked, it rolls into an armoured ball with scales raised: an effective defence against predators, but not against the snare traps of poachers. Pangolins are thought to be the world’s most trafficked mammals. With the four Asian species already hunted to near extinction, the African Wildlife Foundation estimates that around 2.7 million pangolins are trafficked from Africa’s rainforests each year. All eight pangolin species are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list, with three listed as critically endangered. As regulators of insect populations, pangolins are a key species in the rainforest: an individual pangolin consumes as many as 70 million ants and termites a year. Without this natural top-down control conservationists fear there would be a cascading impact on the environment, leaving the forest ecology seriously disrupted. Popular for its meat, the pangolin has long been hunted for local consumption but Gabon’s minister for forests, oceans, environment and climates, Professor Lee White, argues that it is the demand in Asia that is of chief concern. Pangolin scales are a popular ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, used for anything from rheumatism, asthma and cancer to treating infertility in women and promoting lactation. There is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the medicine, so wildlife groups welcomed an announcement in June that pangolin was being removed from the official 2020 listing of ingredients approved for use in traditional Chinese medicine. But any benefits from the move have yet to filter down. “Gabon is seeing the commercial poaching of pangolins,” says White. “The demand from China and the enormous profit margins are attracting organised crime.” International syndicates smuggling ivory, minerals, gold and diamonds at the border with Cameroon have expanded the scope of their business, he says. “For three years now we have been detecting ivory poachers with sacks of pangolin scale.” Lehmann wants to “provide governments with rapid and accurate tools for habitat conservation, and improve wildlife crime forensics in general”, and hopes his research will bolster efforts against poaching and trafficking. Knowledge about the size of the pangolins’ hunting grounds, their population density and seasonally preferred habitats could help the Gabonese National Park Agency to step up effective protective measures, such as more targeted patrols. Lehmann and his team take live samples from giant pangolins such as Ghost – something, according to Lehmann, that has never been done before. After capture and sedation, samples of blood, saliva, faeces, tissue and scales are taken from each animal and then a GPS transmitter is fastened to its tail. The entire procedure lasts about two hours and provides a unique set of data. In addition, a network of 24 to 40 camera traps has been set up in Lopé-Okanda national park to monitor the animals’ movements, nest ecology and habitat use.  It is hoped that information from the camera traps combined with spatial data will provide an insight into the animal’s life expectancy, territoriality and motion range, and shed light on its reproductive behaviour. “We are opening the door to a new universe,” says Lehmann. The scale samples are used to extract their isotopic values, the unique composition of chemical elements such as oxygen, hydrogen or carbon that are stored in the animal’s keratin plates. An “isotopic fingerprint” allows for identification of a pangolin’s geographic home: each environmental zone has its own unique “isoscape”, which can be matched with that of an animal. This technology can be used to identify the origin of confiscated pangolin scales, helping to crack down on smuggling routes.The billion-dollar illegal trade in wild animals is now the world’s fourth largest criminal business, after drugs, counterfeit goods and human trafficking. As the trade is highly mobile with new trade routes emerging every year, the wildlife conservation organisation Traffic recommends international collaboration between source, destination and transit countries in intelligence-led investigations. “We are basically fighting on our own at the moment. And we still haven’t been able to win this war,” says White, who has spearheaded Gabon’s fight against wildlife crimes and, in particular, ivory trafficking for the past three decades. He would like to see more engagement from his European counterparts in the fight to stop international pangolin trafficking. “Thus far, I don’t get the impression that the law enforcement community in most European countries thinks of wildlife crimes particularly seriously.” Traffic reports that most scales smuggled to China from Cameroon or Nigeria are routed through European airports. José Antonio Alfaro Moreno, a senior specialist for environmental crime at Europol, supports law enforcement agencies across Europe with anti-trafficking operations. “Wildlife crime is a new priority area in the European Union,” he says, adding that agencies are working with a variety of new methods, including using sniffer dogs to detect smuggled animals and animal parts. “You need to prove to the court that this is the actual species and no other,” he says, noting the importance of lab-based techniques to identify species. Whereas DNA analysis is common, stable isotope analysis is not yet implemented by most countries. State-of-the-art forensics technology – such as radiocarbon dating and X-ray fluorescence – is already being used to effectively trace illegal timber trading and to target illicit rhino horn and ivory syndicates. “Wildlife forensics is a rapidly developing area, and with good reason,” says Richard Thomas, Traffic’s Head of Communications. “The application of forensic techniques to wildlife crime can provide the same sort of insights as it does to solving regular criminal cases.” Behaviour change on the demand side is equally critical for the conservation of pangolins, says Thomas: “Wildlife crime is perceived as low risk-high benefit: it’s a mindset that needs to be changed. Meanwhile, it’s consumer demand that fuels the trade: change consumer behaviour and you change the whole trade.”  This article was amended on 11 August 2020 to remove an incorrect reference to arms dealing as one of the world’s four largest criminal businesses. These are in fact drugs, counterfeit goods, human trafficking and illegal wildlife.

"We’ve been trading in small things, these past few months. Our walks are simple narratives, the length of the canal towpath and the way through the woods, short on spectacle, lacking in plot twists. Fish break the canal surface to grab for gnats and caddisflies among the floating catkins. Feral greylags lounge in big family gangs on the apron of lawn behind the church. There is a honeybee colony in a hole in one of the big beech trees. We see a stock dove, its beady eye and open expression at once kindly and a little furtive. We roll over old logs in the woods: we find flat-backed millipedes, click-beetle larvae (the potato grower’s dreaded “wireworms”), ground beetles; once we find a toad, thumb-sized, baize-green and the texture of old brick. Steely riffs of song demarcate goldfinch territories. Today, walking the canal at mid-morning, we see what for us amounts to a star turn, a celebrity exclusive. Across the canal, in the long grass beneath a terrace of elder and willow: a fox and three adolescent cubs. I haven’t seen or heard foxes here before (I admit I’m not enough of a countryman to know whether I’ve smelled them). They’re bold, unbothered. The cubs chase and roll and wrestle. They’ll have been out of their earth for perhaps two months. One stops and stares right at us, unblinking across the water. I have known domestic cats to be more wary. “Fox,” I say to my daughter. She has foxes on her nappies, on her socks, on her wallpaper, in her books. “Hox,” she says. Later we walk beneath a cloud of feeding swifts and I tell her they’re saying “wheeeee” as they bomb through the muggy air. The path that runs past a host of wild garlic still smells of garlic even though the plants have died away. We play with tacky straggles of goosegrass. There is robin-song, wren, chiffchaff, blackbird, song thrush. A crow dive-bombs us (I’m not sure what we did to annoy it, but it’s annoyed). In the woods, it begins to rain. But for a soft, white-noise susurration on the waxy beech-leaf canopy high above, we wouldn’t even know."
"In August 2016, a park ranger stumbled upon 323 dead wild tundra reindeer in Norway’s remote Hardangervidda plateau. They had been killed in a freak lightning event. But instead of removing the carcasses, the park decided to leave them where they were, allowing nature to take its course – and scientists to study this island of decomposition and how it might change the arctic tundra ecosystem. Over the years scientists observed the bloated, fly-infested bodies turn into dry skeletons. The latest paper, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science in June, looked at the creation of a “landscape of fear”, as top predators such as wolverines, golden eagles and arctic foxes took advantage of the carrion. “The landscape of fear framework has provided a better understanding of animal decisions in relation to food and safety trade-offs, predator–prey relationships and how communities are structured across trophic levels,” it concluded. With laws in place in Europe meaning carcasses have to be removed in most instances, most people will never see this kind of death and decay. “When we were first there it was a little bit solemn,” lead researcher Shane Frank from the University of South-Eastern Norway in Bø says of the Hardangervidda plateau. “It was sad to see that much life snuffed out so quickly.” Scientists set up camera traps, recorded faeces and observed the wildlife flocking to the carcasses on the plateau, which is 1,220 metres above sea level and a three-hour hike from the nearest town of Liseth in Hardanger. “Over time, as the reindeer decomposed we gained some distance from that ‘death’ feeling. We were also learning so much, in a way giving meaning to it, and it felt like that was an offsetting factor to that solemnity … It’s silly to deny death as part of life,” says Frank. Scavenger birds such as ravens, crows and eagles visited the highest density of carcasses in 2017 and then were nearly absent in 2018. The reverse was true of rodents (such as root vole, lemming, bank vole and field vole), which were absent from the site in 2017 and then were everywhere in 2018. Scientists believe rodents were too fearful to go to the site while these larger birds were around. Carcasses are interaction hotspots, but not all interactions are positive: “It’s kind of like, here’s a buffet, you’ve got a lot of hungry folks coming in to eat, and maybe they don’t like one another very much,” says Frank. Another discovery was that non-scavenger birds such as the meadow pipit, northern wheatear, common reed bunting, bluethroat and lapland bunting all fed on the “bloom” of arthropods, such as blowfly, that developed on the carrion. Meadow pipit were the most common, with up to 80 individuals feeding on the site at once. “The fact that passerines forage on insects at animal carcasses is not a unique phenomenon, but only a few examples exist in literature,” scientists wrote in another paper on the reindeer carcasses published in Ornis Norvegica in December. Further study of how these non-scavenging birds could benefit from carcasses could help conservation efforts. Rotting bodies also change flora. Surrounding the 323 reindeer carcasses were seeds of crowberry – a keystone species of alpine tundra – that scavengers were dropping around the site. Out of 24 faecal samples from crows, 21 contained viable crowberry seeds, according to a study published in Biology Letters in 2018, that suggests seed banks are likely to build up around carcasses. It is now widely accepted that leaving dead wood in forests benefits many species, but leaving carcasses is still taboo. This, along with concerns about the spread of disease, means there has historically been little research on how carrion returns nutrients to ecosystems. Frank says: “We’ve been focusing on animals when they’re alive, where they go, and where are they moving. I don’t know if it’s something about mortality, culturally, from the western perspective, that we’re a little bit averse to. I think people are now kind of warming up to cold bodies, at least in wildlife research. Everything is connected, and circular.” With the escalating climate crisis and increased frequency of extreme weather, mass mortality events, such as the deaths of the reindeer in Hardangervidda, will probably become more common. The Australian bushfires, for example, are estimated to have killed more than 800m animals (excluding frogs, insects and other invertebrates), which will cause long-term changes in ecosystems. Unseasonably warm weather in Kazakhstan in 2015 caused a normally harmless pathogen to wipe out 200,000 saiga antelope in a few weeks, and 1m seabirds starved to death in 2015-16 because of a giant “blob” of hot ocean around north America. Two decades ago, our understanding of the importance of scavenging was more limited. Now, experts from different disciplines are identifying research opportunities linked to the study of death in the landscape, says zoologist Marcos Moleón from the University of Granada in Spain. He believes we are in “the golden age of scavenging research”, with increasing recognition of the key functions scavengers play in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Looking at scavenged prey means we understand connections and interactions in food webs better, and how they create stable ecosystems. “Especially important are those scavengers that may perform long-distance movements and distribute nutrients over large spatial scales, such as vultures and large mammalian predators,” he says. This doesn’t translate into policy – carcasses are left to rot in Europe only in exceptional circumstances, such as when they provide food for rare scavengers such as vultures. Large mammals that graze nature reserves are generally considered domestic, so their bodies are removed once they have died. One famous exception is herbivores introduced to the controversial Oostvaardersplassen nature reserve, east of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The rewilding experiment – known as the Dutch Serengeti – caused outrage after thousands of red deer, Konik horses and Heck cattle starved in the winter, partly because of the absence of predators such as wolves. Carcasses were left outside in public view, with many protesters condemning the project as “animal abuse”. Research published in the science journal Plos One in January suggests the red deer carcasses benefited biodiversity in Oostvaardersplassen. After near-complete decomposition, plant biomass surrounding them was five times greater than usual, leading to an increase in plant-eating invertebrates and therefore an increase in predators. This bloom of life lasted for months and spread through food chains – even creating scrubby areas and heterogeneity in the landscape, scientists found. Lead researcher Roel van Klink from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands said carcass ecology played an important part in the “rewilding” of the reserve: “Obviously, because there is a carcass lying there large grazers, such as deer, avoid grazing around it because they know it’s unhealthy. You then get this huge bush of thistles. Hypothetically, scrub could start growing here and then trees, and eventually you could potentially have a completely different landscape.” However, owing to strong animal welfare concerns, leaving carcasses to decompose is now seriously controlled. The Dutch state forestry service says large herbivore populations should not exceed 1,100 animals in Oostvaardersplassen (there were 2,855 at one point) and only around 30 to 40 deer carcasses are left out over the winter. Various nature organisations are working together to recover cadavers in the landscape as part of the Dutch “dood doet leven” (death makes life) programme. The organisation believes policy change is vital if scavengers such as red kite, black kite and monk vulture are to return to Europe. Leaving out dead trees and animals transforms the landscape for the better, it argues. Van Klink says: “We could have many more large raptors, like white-tailed eagles everywhere from the UK to Germany to Poland, if there was much more carrion lying around. Many large raptors would love it.” In Hardangervidda – the largest plateau in Europe – carcasses are likely to be benefitting biodiversity and creating heterogeneity in ecosystems. However, in more densely populated parts of Europe, the sight of death in the landscape remains problematic. Despite an increasing body of research showing the importance of scavenging in food webs, farmers and vets also remain extremely concerned about the potential for disease to spread, and so leaving out carrion is unlikely to be acceptable in the wider landscape any time soon. Van Klink says it is an “uphill battle” to make leaving out carcasses more acceptable on nature reserves. “Progress is slow and will be local, but there is definitely some progress. We just need to keep pushing,” he says.

"Environmental groups have accused a Russian mining firm of emphasising the role of global climate change in last week’s historic oil spill in part to avoid punishment for its ageing infrastructure and potential negligence in the accident. The World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace Russia said that although climate change likely played a role in the spillage of more than 20,000 tons of diesel fuel that turned two rivers crimson near the Arctic city of Norilsk, the risks of thawing permafrost to Arctic infrastructure were publicly known and could have been addressed months or years earlier.  The accident is one of the largest in Russian history and had been compared by Greenpeace to the Exxon Valdez spill. Regional officials on Tuesday said some pollutants from the leak had reached Lake Pyasino, a large body of water that leads to the Kara Sea. But the main damage has been done to the local Ambarnaya and Daldykan rivers and may take a decade to clean, local officials and environmentalists have said. Nornickel said that its monitoring did not show that the lake had been contaminated, citing the “endeavour and the sacrifice of the accident responders” who had responded to the spill and placed sea boons to halt the fuel’s spread. A Russian emergency official on Tuesday also said that contamination levels in the lake remained “within the maximum permissible concentration,” according to data from Russia’s environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor. The operational director for the mining firm Nornickel, Sergei Dyachenko, had earlier denied that negligence at its subsidiary could have caused the accident. In a company press release, he said that “anomalously warm temperatures” may have sped the thaw of permafrost beneath a gas tank and led to its collapse. In another press release, the company blamed the accident on “a sudden sinking of supports of the storage tank which served accident-free for more than 30 years”. Experts have pointed to the broad impact of climate change in Russia’s Arctic region over the past decade, noting in particular how thawing permafrost has led to fissures in apartment buildings in Norilsk. But environmental groups say they are worried that Nornickel, a company that has been attacked in the past as one of Russia’s biggest polluters in the Arctic, is now seeking to twist concerns about climate change to its defence. “It’s an attempt to write off Nornickel’s failure in risk management and ecological safety on the fashionable topic of climate change,” said Alexey Knizhnikov of the World Wildlife Federation. “The main factor is mismanagement.” The accident, and a government investigation into its causes, is likely to have serious repercussions for Russian industry in the Arctic. Russian oversight agencies have drafted plans to review oil reservoirs throughout the region and investigators have charged one power plant official with violating environmental protection rules, which carries a maximum sentence of five years. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, also gave a public scolding last week to Vladimir Potanin, the billionaire president of Nornickel, about the company’s ageing reservoirs. “If you had changed them on time, there would have been no environmental damage and no need to foot such costs,” Putin told Potanin in a televised video call. Nornickel has pledged to cover all costs for the cleanup and to restore the local environment. Greenpeace Russia last week put out a statement titled “The melting of the permafrost is not an excuse for Nornickel”, noting it believed the company “sought to avoid responsibility for the accident” by blaming it on climate change. The environmental organisation noted that as far back as 2009 it had reported on the risks to Russia’s oil-and-gas infrastructure from thawing permafrost. “It’s not possible that the company did not know about [thawing permafrost], but it is possible that the company used a dangerous facility irresponsibly,” said Vasily Yablokov, Greenpeace Russia’s climate project manager. Weak enforcement and business cost decisions meant companies were hesitant to replace technology, he said. “In principle, the interests of businesses are put above the ecology,” said Yablokov. A Nornickel spokesperson said: “So far, we have only named a possible version of what happened. Final conclusions can be drawn only after the investigation is completed.” She also said the company was actively involved in the clean-up from the accident. During a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, Dyachenko said the company believed that thawing permafrost was the cause of the accident. He said: “There wasn’t any precise monitoring being done on permafrost before [the accident],” adding that local efforts to monitor the thawing permafrost were focused on the city of Norilsk and its residential building stock.  In a statement provided after publication, Nornickel said it “categorically rejects accusations of any attempts to avoid blame or downplay its responsibility for the diesel spillage in the Arctic,” adding that such accidents were “absolutely unacceptable regardless of their primary cause.” The company said it was cooperating with law enforcement agencies and had launched “a full and thorough internal investigation” into the accident. “We unequivocally accept that climate change risks, including those of abnormally high temperatures in the Arctic, must be properly addressed and mitigated. Nornickel has immediately launched a comprehensive inquiry into the increased risks we are now facing so to avoid climate-change related accidents in future.” “We fully accept our responsibility for the event and are making appropriate financial provisions and arrangements for related legal liabilities as well as additional voluntary commitments in order to mitigate the inflicted environmental damage,” the company said."
"Pangolin scales have been removed from an official 2020 listing of ingredients approved for use in traditional Chinese medicine in a move lauded by animal protection groups as a key step in stamping out trade in the scaly anteater, the world’s most trafficked mammal. As many as 200,000 pangolins are consumed each year in Asia for their scales and meat and more than 130 tonnes of scales, live and dead animals were seized in cross-border trafficking busts last year, a figure estimated to represent up to 400,000 animals, according to conservation group WildAid. Trade in all eight species of pangolin are protected under international law and three of the four native to Asia are included on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered species, including the functionally extinct Chinese pangolin. The news of the delisting from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmacopoeia, reported by China’s Health Times newspaper, comes after the country’s State Forestry and Grassland Administration (SFGA) raised the protected status of pangolins to the highest level last week, with immediate effect. “I am very encouraged,” said Zhou Jinfeng, secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF), who has long pushed for better protection of pangolins and for stopping the use of their scales. “Our continuous efforts for several years have not been in vain.” In February, China’s National People’s Congress pushed forward a ban on the consumption of meat from wild animals, though there has been uncertainty as to what wildlife will still be allowed for use in TCM and the fur and leather industries. More clarity is expected once China finalises and approves revisions to its wildlife protection law, possibly in the next year. “We highly applaud this announcement, made in recognition of the need to protect critically endangered pangolins,” Steve Blake, chief representative of WildAid in Beijing, told the Guardian. “Along with upgrading pangolins to a national level 1 protected species, these two actions are crucial to help curb illegal trade,” Blake said. “This shows China’s rapidly strengthened commitment to protecting wildlife.” “But we still have a long way to go,” Zhou said. “We need to be vigilant about so-called ‘captive breeding’ and medicinal research [related to pangolin] because some wrong findings could lead to the wrong policy decisions,” Zhou said. The SFGA currently provides permits to TCM pharmaceutical companies for using parts from previous stockpiles or poorly regulated “farmed” wildlife, but the practice is widely shown to be a magnet for poaching and the illegal trafficking of both parts and live animals.Pangolins – which are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity – have been in the spotlight since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, due to studies suggesting they may have been the intermediate host that transmitted the virus to humans. Of the two animals known to naturally carry the Sars-CoV-2 virus – bats and pangolins – the latter is the most problematic, both for its meat and for the scales that protect its body. Neither has been positively identified as the intermediate source that transferred the virus to humans, though a 100% identification may prove elusive, according to experts. Since 1 January, when Chinese authorities shut down the Wuhan wet market where the virus was suspected to have originated, no official details have been released about the specific wildlife found there. What is known is that out of the 33 samples taken by investigators from the market that tested positive for the Sars-CoV-2 virus, 31 were from the area where wildlife was sold. Pangolin meat is eaten by China’s elite in the hope of health or sexual benefits, even though TCM texts going back to ancient times warn against eating the animals. In the past five years more than 14,000 whole pangolins have been seized by customs agents at border crossings in Asia, with 95% of those in shipments of 21 animals or more. This suggests a coordinated trafficking effort, according to data compiled for the Guardian by C4ADS, a Washington DC-based thinktank that monitors illicit wildlife, drug and corruption networks. Since 2015, 99% of all whole pangolin seizures – both live and dead – have occurred in Asia, with 24% of those at China’s borders, followed by a large number of seizures in Vietnam and India, according to C4ADS. Most of the whole pangolins are being trafficked from Laos, Thailand and India. “Notably, there has been a significant drop in reporting on pangolin seizures since December 2019,” Amanda Shaver, a wildlife crime analyst with C4ADS, told the Guardian. “This is most likely due to the increased media focus and coverage on Covid-19, but our databases have recorded only 18 seizures of whole pangolins in Asia in 2020 so far, a 78% decrease from 2019.” As for scale seizures, in the past five years 32% of those have been at mainland China’s borders, although Hong Kong seizures accounted for 17%, according to C4ADS. Figuring out where they originated is a challenge, according to Shaver, but available data shows Nigeria (25%), Malaysia (17%) and Indonesia (12%) as the top sources for scales.   This article was amended on 25 June 2020 because an earlier version mistakenly included an old quote from Amanda Shaver that referred to C4ADS not recording “a single seizure of whole pangolin in Asia in 2020”. That was true at the end of March this year. This has been replaced with a quote from Shaver from June 2020, which details 18 such seizures. "
"Swimmers itching to take advantage of the easing of lockdown to have their first sea bathes or wild swims of the summer should pick their spot wisely: only two-thirds of the UK’s bathing waters are of excellent quality, according to the latest data, putting Britain near the bottom of Europe’s league table for bathing water quality. Most of the rest of the UK’s beaches were of good or sufficient quality last year, with fewer than one in 20 judged to be poor, in the annual survey by the European Environment Agency. While the UK’s showing was better than the previous year, with 66% of sites reaching the “excellent” standard for 2019 compared with 63% in 2018, it came in sixth from bottom in the survey of European countries, comprising EU member states plus Switzerland and Albania. Overall, 85% of bathing sites surveyed by the EU’s environmental watchdog received the top rating of excellent for 2019. Poland appeared to score worst, with only 22% of sites being of excellent quality, far below the next lowest on the list, Albania, where 59% of sites qualified for the top rating. However, the survey’s compilers noted that Poland’s poor showing was affected by the large number of newly identified sites – 419 out of 606; this meant monitoring was incomplete. Of the 187 sites which were classified, they said, about 70% were found to be excellent. Only 5% of monitored sites across Europe failed to reach the minimum rating of “sufficient”. The survey does not take account of all possible bathing waters, monitoring only commonly used coastal beaches and some inland sites. Earlier this year, UK campaigners called for communities to apply for bathing water status for their swimming spots, which forces water companies and the Environment Agency to clean up the water if it does not meet requirements. In many areas, water companies are legally allowed to discharge untreated sewage into waterways, but having rivers designated as bathing areas means these outflows can be curtailed. Swimmers are also warned that the EEA data is from last year and so does not take into account the impacts of an unusually wet winter followed by an exceptionally dry spring. Bathers are advised to check before setting out and to heed the government’s rules on physical distancing, as well as any local restrictions in force. Out of 22,295 bathing sites in Europe, nearly 85% were of excellent quality, according to the EEA report. Cyprus, Austria, Malta, Greece and Croatia topped the list with more than 95% of all sites proving to be of excellent quality.  The EU’s environment commissioner said countries should not take high quality water for granted. “Clean bathing water is usually taken as something that is gifted, but it’s actually one of the European collective achievements,” said Virginijus Sinkevičius. “It’s the result of hard work by many people over many years. This year’s report once again confirms that European citizens can continue to enjoy very high quality standards when bathing in European waters and all measures must be taken to continue along this path.” Before the UK was forced by EU regulations to clean up beaches and inland waterways, many were unfit for swimming and heavily polluted with sewage or other effluent. Campaigners are concerned that the UK could water down some of its environmental commitments after Brexit without firm EU directives to follow on measures such as water and air quality. The quality of UK beaches has risen and fallen in recent years, and can vary markedly based on factors such as droughts, which cause sewage to back up, followed by heavy rain, which can flush it out into rivers and on to beaches. This year’s showing continues a poor run compared with earlier this decade, however, as 83% of beaches were rated excellent in 2011. After Brexit the UK can still submit to monitoring by the EEA, which as part of its remit reports on several other European or neighbouring states that are not EU members, including Iceland, Greenland, Norway and Turkey. “Regular monitoring and assessment of bathing water are essential for ensuring that we maintain the already very high quality across Europe and, where needed, we take effective measures to address water pollution,” said Hans Bruyninckx, the executive director of the EEA. “Cleaner bathing waters do not only benefit our own health and wellbeing, but also the health of the environment.”"
"Coalmining communities have called for immediate action to stem the economic devastation wrought by the decline of coal, rising job losses and the coronavirus pandemic. More than 84 organizations, including the Just Transition Fund, Appalachian Voices, Center for Coalfield Justice, Native Renewables and Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, released a National Economic Transition platform on Monday in an effort to help coal communities adapt to climate change. About 33,000 coalmining jobs in the US have been lost in the past decade, a trend likely to continue as renewable energy is expected to overtake coal in electricity production for the first time ever in 2020. Coal consumption is projected to decline by 23% this year, and the coronavirus pandemic has led to the permanent closure of several mines. The declining coal industry is having significant effects on communities historically reliant on coal, such as Appalachia, the Navajo nation, and parts of Illinois and Wyoming. Adam Wells of Appalachian Voices in Wise county, Virginia, said: “The vast majority of people in my community understand what’s happening with coal and know it’s not going to come back.” He said: “Workers and communities from across the country that helped power the nation in the last century should be among the first to lead and benefit from the transition into the economy of the 21st century – but that’s not going to happen on its own. “We need a federally scaled program and intervention to make sure those communities aren’t left behind and it has to be from the ground up.” The organizations are demanding the immediate creation of a Federal Office of Economic Transition, to implement an action plan created within a year by a national just transition taskforce. Nicole Horseherder, executive director of Tó Nizhóní Ání, the environmental advocacy group, said the coalition focuses on bringing coal communities out of poverty. She said: “This is not something others are talking about, and it’s what I think this platform does. It illustrates how even environmental impacts are also economic impacts.” The platform includes calls for reclamation projects of coal sites; investing in social and physical infrastructure projects, expanding sustainable agriculture and forestry sectors; holding coal companies accountable during bankruptcies; diversifying local economies in these regions with an emphasis on small businesses; and providing federal support to expand the clean, renewable energy sector. Brandon Denison, the chief executive of the Coalfield Development Corporation, in Wayne, West Virginia, said: “A lot of times when we talk about a new economy in discussions about mitigating climate change, coal communities are thought of as collateral damage, and that we just need to get some money to those people to ease the pain. But our workforce has the skills needed to transform the economy.” He added: “I’m hoping we can reframe the discussion to see the potential in coal communities and not just the hurt.”"
"The bankruptcy of Chesapeake, the pioneer of using fracking to mine shale gas and oil, could mark a new, straitened era for the oil industry, according to analysts. The Oklahoma City-based company said on Sunday that it had been forced to enter chapter 11 protection to reduce the size of its debt pile from $9bn (£7.3bn) to $2bn. A grace period for paying bondholders had been due to expire on Tuesday. Oil industry analysts said they expected more higher-cost and indebted shale companies to fold or be bought by competitors because of low oil and gas prices. “The growth at all costs model is out the window,” said Robert Polk, an analyst at oil research company Wood Mackenzie. Environmental campaigners said the bankruptcy highlighted the risks to investors holding shares in oil and gas companies that have previously prized growth above cash flow. Jeanne Martin, the campaign manager at ShareAction, said the Chesapeake bankruptcy should serve as a “wake-up call” for banks including Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and HSBC, which had continued to fund the fracking industry despite knowledge of their contribution to the climate crisis. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. Martin said: “Environmentalists have raised the alarm about the environmental disaster of fracking and the vulnerability of the fracking industry for years. Chesapeake’s bankruptcy flagrantly shows that these risks are no longer on the horizon, but at companies’ doorstep.” US and Canadian energy firms have cut the number of oil and gas rigs operating to a record low, despite the slight increase in oil prices recently. The number of operating rigs in the US has fallen to only 265 by 26 June, down by more than 700 in the past 12 months, according to the oil data company Baker Hughes. “No massive investments are likely to be made in the foreseeable future given the gigantic mountains of debt and the considerable financial risks,” said the Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg. Joachim Klement, an analyst at the stockbroker Liberum, said the lowest-cost oil producing nations such as Saudi Arabia and its partners in the oil cartel, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, could act to keep prices at about $40 per barrel to heighten pressure on Russia. “If that means that some unwanted competition from US shale oil producers will disappear as well, then that would just be a welcome side effect,” Klement wrote. Companies such as QEP Resources, Highpoint Resources, Oasis Petroleum and Whiting Petroleum needed oil prices of $40 or even $50 per barrel to break even, Klement said. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate oil for August delivery was just above $39 on Monday. However, Wood Mackenzie and other analysts cautioned that the Chesapeake bankruptcy and the difficulties facing other companies were not terminal for the broader sector. “There’s been less capital that will be deployed to the sector, but that doesn’t mean there’s going to be no capital,” Polk said."
"It’s early morning, and I’m floating on my back, a speck in a dark eye of water, surrounded by the green, foliose skin of a vast beast. If I turn my head to one side I can see a wooded moraine, the lower rim of the eye. To the other side is a jutting brow of pale rock rising above the tightly packed heads of oak, ash, beech. This is Gormire, an oval glacial lake lying beneath a 140-metre cliff – the rim of the North York Moors plateau, in which the entire 55m-year span of the Jurassic is stacked in layered gritstone, limestone and muddy shale. It is undoubtedly one of the best swimming spots in the country. From the precipitous viewpoints above, the deep water sometimes glows green, sometimes flashes blue, but usually it is dark. It has no apparent tributaries or outflows, but somehow brims clear, year-round, from an invisible source. Unsurprisingly, stories flow from this apparent mystery. They say the lake is bottomless. They say it is a portal to hell, used by the devil himself. They say that a goose that once disappeared beneath the surface emerged, minus its feathers, in a well 12 miles away. They say the pike here are big enough to take a small dog. They say the water teems with leeches; and there’s truth there at least – I’ve seen some the length of my hand, blobbing and ribboning with gruesome grace over the sand, though they’ve never touched me. A few weeks ago, before the solstice, the steep path down the cliff rang with birdsong, but now the air is hot and heavy with imminent change, and for a moment everything is so breath-held quiet that hanging there, in the middle of the eye, in the middle of this strangest of years, I can almost believe that if the beast is going to blink, it might be now. It turns out that something has changed, but I only see it after I’ve dried and dressed: new official notices, which I’d failed to see on my walk down. They say the lake is cold and deep, and there are no lifeguards. They say it’s not safe for swimming. They say stay out of the water."
"Thames Water: “We invested more than £1bn again in 2019-20, leading to a total of £15bn in the past 15 years, and we will continue to spend wisely on improving resilience, service and efficiency, as well as provide more support for customers in vulnerable circumstances. “Our shareholders are in it for the long term and have not taken a dividend for three years to prioritise investment in improving service for customers and to protect the environment.” Anglian Water: “With regard to dividend payments, it would be incorrect to say that borrowing is used to pay dividends. Financing though debt is the most cost-effective and legitimate way to fund new infrastructure. Customers benefit, bills are cheaper. This is why we do it. “To be able to continually maintain and improve our critical infrastructure, reduce leakage and meet the needs of a fast-growing, prosperous region, we rely on generating cost-effective funding from a variety of sources. “Over the past 20 years, customers have paid for just half of the investment that has been made in new infrastructure. The rest has come from our debt investors. By borrowing money and using the right amount of debt, we are able to keep customers’ bills down. This year customer bills reduced by 6% after inflation, roughly £26 per year. “Last year, we invested about £1bn in the region and in infrastructure, and it is worth noting that our entire capital programme is financed by green bonds, reflecting our cost-effective, low-carbon and sustainable approach to construction.” United Utilities: “Over the past 18 years, United Utilities has invested £1.2bn improving our overflow discharges to reduce the incidence, volume and impact of spills. After obtaining permits from the Environment Agency for 606 temporary-deemed consents, we have carried out further investment to stop some of them discharging altogether. “We now have a greater understanding of the system than at any point in history, thanks to a successful project, completed in March, to install flow monitors on more than 90% of our overflows. This vast amount of data is being analysed in order to inform our investment programmes and we are actively exploring innovative solutions to help us do this work faster.” Wessex Water: “In an ideal world there would not be a combined sewerage system. But many sewers were laid at a time when only one drain served a property – carrying both rainwater and sewage. “To separate the flows into two systems is not possible without causing massive disruption to motorists as thousands of kilometres of road would have to be dug up, which would cost many billions of pounds and resulting in a significant increase in bills. “Since 2000, we have invested £181m to upgrade more than 582 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and there are plans to improve more over the next five years, spending a further £26m on CSO investigations and improvements, in line with the storm overflow assessment framework.” Severn Trent: “CSOs are central to the design of sewer systems as they also play an important role in protecting properties from flooding, and the discharges they make are permitted and regulated by the Environment Agency so as not to have a detrimental impact on rivers. “Since privatisation, Severn Trent has invested hundreds of millions of pounds in upgrading and maintaining our CSOs to achieve stringent river water quality standards set by UK and European legislation. “Over the past five years we have installed monitoring at more than 80% of our CSOs and have completed detailed investigations of 32 river reaches within our region to identify further sites for improvement.” Southern Water said: “Protecting rivers is a key part of Southern Water’s mission. CSO releases are made to protect homes and businesses from internal and external flooding. These releases occur because in many areas surface drains are connected into our sewer system – which is how they were constructed for many years. “In heavy rain, such as experienced this winter when more than 2bn litres of water fell on Hampshire in the first two months of the year alone, no wastewater treatment work can cope – they were not designed to handle storm water. “Many of our wastewater treatment works have storm tanks as buffers, and only when these are full of the highly dilute mixture of rain and wastewater are releases permitted by the Environment Agency. “The company has led the industry in storm-spill event and duration monitoring, meaning that our self-reporting of storm releases far outstrips the industry average. “We continue to invest in both monitoring and other mitigation measures. Our bathing water enhancement programme spent £33m in the past five years including on projects such as a £3m storm tank tunnel in Shanklin on the Isle of Wight which will cut the number of storm releases by an estimated 33%. “In some areas especially prone to sewer flooding we have taken the expensive and disruptive step of physically separating combined sewers and surface water drains. In one small part of Portsmouth this was a £50m project. This makes it clear that digging up thousands of streets and roads would cost many billions and cause massive disruption and would not be acceptable to our customers or to regulators. “In the last 12 months a further 111 monitors were added to overflows to further enhance our monitoring. We have now virtually completed installing monitoring across our storm over flows and by March 2021 we will be reporting virtually every event to the EA.” Northumbrian Water and Yorkshire Water did not respond to requests for a comment. South West Water said it was content for the industry body Water UK to respond on behalf of the sector. A spokesperson for Water UK said: “The water industry is committed to the very highest environmental standards … Although there is currently no simple and effective alternative to overflows, there are some innovative solutions being used, such as sustainable drainage systems, which are natural features that help keep rainwater out of the sewer. In new housing developments, these can help to take some of the pressure off the sewer network. “There’s also action we can all take in our day-to-day lives to help safeguard our rivers and waterways, such as helping to prevent blockages or fatbergs clogging up sewers – these are among the biggest causes of unauthorised overflow discharges into the environment. “By not flushing products such as wet wipes down the down the toilet or pouring fats, oils and grease down the sink, we can all help keep our sewers clear and minimise the wastewater entering our natural environment.”"
"The rackety magpie family has moved home, from the ivy bush to a tall cypress with a dying ash tree beside it. I can see the convenience of this. The ash branches are perfect lookout posts to all quarters. The gloomy depths of the cypress provide suitable roosts for the entire magpie clan. But its established occupants are none too pleased. Collared doves grumble out their grievances daylong. The far more startling protests of the jays reach my ears from wherever my feet have taken me around the village. Is there any more startling British birdcall than that of the jay? Its name in Welsh sums it up: sgrech y coed (screecher of the woods), though there is far more to this smallest and most beautiful of Britain’s native crows than its raucous voice of protest, which used to rouse my little terrier to paroxysms of indignation and fruitless pursuit. The colour scheme of jays’ plumage – cinnamon and celestial azure – is exquisite, set off to perfection by velvet-black and pure white secondaries, a speckled crest, and the bright blue iris of the eye. This is a gorgeous bird. Its character too is distinctive: “tireless energy, and a liveliness of disposition and alertness almost without parallel among British birds” is how WH Hudson (1841-1922) described it. You more often hear it than see it, though. Centuries of persecution have left this vital, intelligent creature intensely wary of humankind. Its tireless energy in collecting and hiding acorns is surely responsible for great tracts of oakwood throughout Britain. The jay is truly, to adapt the title of Jean Giono’s haunting 1953 eco-fable, l’oiseau qui plantait des arbres, the bird that planted trees. Adaptation has a Darwinian relevance here too. The jay’s gullet relative to that of other corvids is enlarged, and copiously supplied with saliva to make regurgitation into the cache easier. Acorns – they can carry up to nine at a time– are at present off the menu. I catch the visionary flash of these sky-jewels dipping across low westering sunrays, heading out to estuarine fields for insects and worms before returning, lapidary in the last light, to roost."
"A chicken processing facility in western North Carolina reportedly underwent widespread testing for Covid-19 in early June. Workers at the plant were scared. Several employees had already tested positive and the company, Case Farms – which has been repeatedly condemned for animal treatment and workers’ rights violations – was not providing proper protective equipment. “We don’t have a lot of space at work. We are shoulder to shoulder,” said one worker, who declined to be identified, during a recent union call. “I’m afraid to go to work, but I have to go.” The testing turned up 150 positive cases at the facility, the worker said. On 8 June, the health department for Burke county, where the Case Farms facility is located, reported 136 new Covid cases, a 25% increase in its total caseload. Yet neither the company, county officials nor the North Carolina department of health and human services would confirm whether those cases were connected to Case Farms. It is just one example of the currently taut relationship between public health and the economy in North Carolina, as the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations rises. North Carolina is one of the largest pork and poultry producing states in the US, exporting roughly $1.25bn in hogs, chickens and turkeys every year. Health departments in rural parts of the state, areas that often lean on large meatpacking or food processing facilities as primary sources of employment, have so far been tight-lipped about Covid-19 outbreaks in those plants. In late April, while outbreaks began emerging at meat processing plants across the country, Donald Trump signed an executive order forcing the facilities to remain open. That same month, the US exported a record amount of pork to China, despite industry claims of a domestic shortage. Since the pandemic began, more than 36,000 meat processing and farm workers have tested positive for Covid-19 and at least 116 have died, according to a tally by the Food and Environment Reporting Network, though the true number is likely higher. Through case interviews and contact tracing, the Burke county health department, where Case Farms is located, does have data about where people with positive cases work, but are choosing not to release it, said spokeswoman Lisa Moore. “We know where they are, but we are not a county that can divulge every place where they are,” Moore said. Case Farms requested the health department direct all questions regarding their facility to a company representative, Moore added. In response to a series of detailed questions from the Guardian, a Case Farms spokesperson wrote that the company is “committed to continue producing food for our nation’s food supply, while taking additional safety measures to protect our employees, our company and our customers, in accordance with USDA regulations and CDC guidelines.” Earlier this year, North Carolina’s health department had reported the names of farms with two or more positive cases, but in May replaced the names with addresses in order to “better reflect the location of the outbreak”, according to a department spokesperson. “Why, when a nursing home has an outbreak, it’s in the paper, but when a meatpacking facility does, it’s not?” said Mac Legerton, a longtime grassroots policy advocate and co-director of the Robeson County Cooperative for Sustainable Development, and is among those who have criticized local and state governments’ approach to case reporting. “The law needs to be that in a pandemic all outbreaks at public and private facilities are made public to protect the employees of the institutions and to inform the public.” As of Thursday, there were 2,772 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in 28 meat processing plant “clusters” around the state, the department said, but would not specify further. North Carolina as a whole has seen a marked increase in cases and hospitalizations over the past several weeks, prompting a “concerned” Governor Roy Cooper to announce last week that the state would pause in the second phase of its reopening plan. The state requires only a few types of businesses to report outbreaks, which it defines as two or more cases, including congregate living facilities, daycare centers and schools. For all other businesses, local health departments and the state DHHS depend on companies volunteering their own data or tracking down clusters through case interviews. But failure to disclose outbreaks demonstrates that officials and company executives are prioritizing economic interests over the wellbeing of marginalized workers and communities, Legerton said. “That lack of information puts both employees and the public at risk,” he said. In a letter to several of the largest meat companies last week, senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker called on the corporations to disclose infection figures in their plants. Virginia also recently moved to create a set of safety rules to protect workers from Covid-19 – the first of its kind in the nation – following a petition from workers in the state’s poultry processing and meatpacking industries. The drafted rules, which include requiring employers to mandate social distancing and notify employees of potential exposure, would be enforceable through fines and closures. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has received nearly 350 Covid-related complaints from employees at North Carolina businesses. One business, Pilgrim’s Pride, a poultry processing plant in Sanford, was the subject of at least eight separate complaints, with workers alleging the company was not informing them of positive tests or mandating the wearing of some protective equipment. A worker there died in May. In Robeson county – home to a large Campbell’s Soup facility, Mountaire Farms and Sanderson Farms poultry processing plants, as well as many factory farms – businesses have been generally forthcoming with the health department, according to Bill Smith, the county’s health department director. Smith’s office received $600,000 in federal Covid funding, which it used to set up testing sites around the county and hire school nurses as contact tracers. Smith and his team have also been collaborating on daily calls with health departments from surrounding counties, as well as coordinating closely with the local Lumbee Tribe. But companies can make this work difficult, muddying the waters for case reporting in communities where they are one of very few employers, Smith said. “A lot of the packing places are your largest employers, therefore it’s an economic issue,” he said. “There may be pressures from them to stay out of the packing world, if you will.” Companies also choose to weigh public health considerations alongside public relations in determining what information to release, Smith said, pointing to publicly traded giants like Sanderson Farms and Smithfield Foods, which have “a brand they’re trying to protect”. “If you say something about Smithfield Foods, they’ll see an effect immediately: you’ll see someone not buy Smithfield in the grocery,” he said. Still, the decision by state and county health departments to report some outbreaks and not others appears inconsistent with the need for transparency in a public health crisis, Smith noted. “When you’re releasing nursing home names with two illnesses, yet another place that has 900 you refuse to give, there’s some disagreement there from a public health perspective,” he said.

"Claims that major developments are being regularly held up because of legal challenges to environmental approvals have been dismissed in new research. The research by GreenLaw, a research and policy group run by law students at the Australian National University, conducted an empirical review of public interest litigation in the federal court on environmental matters over the past decade. In a submission to the review of national environment laws, the group said environmental cases made up a “negligible portion” of the federal court’s workload, and their study found “strong evidence that public interest litigants are not abusing court processes to disrupt and delay proponents”. Government ministers, including the resources minister, Keith Pitt, have repeatedly said that legal challenges are unreasonably delaying major projects. “It shouldn’t be up to cashed-up activists to be able to hold up particular projects for a decade, simply because they can afford to,” Pitt said in April. In 2016, when the Turnbull government planned to change the law to limit the right of environmental groups to challenge developments in court, the then resources minister, Matt Canavan, said activists “seek to subvert our legal system for political ends”. “If these disruption tactics aren’t stopped they will cause economic damage to our country through lost ­investment and jobs,” Canavan said. In September Canavan urged the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to step in to fix the “green lawfare debacle” over the proposed expansion of the New Acland coalmine. Earlier this year the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the “lawfare that is such a part of today’s environmental landscape can be crippling to ­business as well as to environmental organisations”. The GreenLaw study, to be published in the Environmental Law and Planning Journal, examined the number of public interest cases involving the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act or the environment minister, to test whether litigants were flooding the courts with environmental challenges. GreenLaw found 32 cases between 2009 and 2019, of which 19 went to judgment and 13 were discontinued. “This amounts to approximately 3.2 public interest cases filed per year, a negligible portion of both the Federal Court’s caseload and the total annual number of decisions made by the Environment Department,” the group said in a submission to the EPBC Act review. “Our review found strong evidence that public interest litigants are not abusing court processes to disrupt and delay proponents.” The EPBC Act is under a once-in-a-decade review by the former competition watchdog chair Graeme Samuel. An interim report is due at the end of this month, but the government has indicated a desire to speed up assessment processes. Some critics of the act have focused on environmental organisations that have taken court action over decisions on high-profile projects such as Adani’s Carmichael mine. But the department’s own annual report shows the number of legal challenges to EPBC decisions is low, with only six challenges to 2,161 decisions listed in 2018-19. Some of these were cases taken by private individuals for reasons unrelated to environmental conservation. A 2015 paper co-authored by the legal academics Andrew Macintosh, Heather Roberts and Amy Constable examined environmental citizen suits for the period from 2000 to 2015 and found they were “seldom taken and rarely won”. GreenLaw’s study found the number of public interest environmental cases was 0.06% of the federal court’s average yearly workload and that 26% were successful, which they said was comparable to success rates for cases brought to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. When they looked only at cases brought by environmental NGOs, not individuals, they found 45% were successful. “This demonstrates that public interest litigants are bringing genuine cases with the intention of ensuring proper government decision-making and accountability,” the submission states. They also examined whether a high number of litigants were filing for injunctions that would temporarily stop a development or project from proceeding. They found 8% of cases involving NGOs sought an injunction, and 16.7% of all cases. The director of Melbourne University’s centre for resources, energy and environmental law, Lee Godden, said the outcomes of GreenLaw’s research were consistent with several other studies that showed legal challenges to EPBC decisions accounted for a very small volume of the federal court’s workload. “Again, the evidence indicates that such litigation is rarely vexatious and that open standing provisions form an important democratic safeguard,” Godden said. She said the EPBC Act gave only a small window for citizen participation in relation to nationally significant environmental matters and that recent bushfire appeals showed Australians were aware that endangered species and ecosystems held special value. “It is important not to further limit access to justice for public interest litigation in an era where across the world, the rule of law is being tested not by citizens engaged in lawfare but by the accrual of executive government power,” Godden said. Annika Reynolds, one of the study authors, said the goal of the study was to bring empirical research up to date at a time when so-called “lawfare” was the subject of political commentary. “What we found was there was no evidence of vexatious proceedings, or abuse of court processes and in fact what we found was that since 2015, public interest litigants have actually been more successful in court procedures than historically,” she said. “One of our big discussion points is the rate of public interest litigation is so low that we have real concerns that the public is actually not able to be substantially involved in the vast majority of decisions.”"
"Repeated noise from whale-watching boat engines could be affecting humpback mothers and their calves while they stop to rest on their long migrations to the Antarctic, a study has found. Researchers found as engine noise went up, humpback whale mothers spent less time resting, their breathing rate increased and they swam faster. Using an underwater speaker playing engine sounds at different volumes, the researchers monitored the behaviour of 42 different pairs of humpback whale mothers and calves in Exmouth Gulf in the north-west of Western Australia. The lead author of the study, Dr Kate Sprogis, a marine mammal researcher at Aarhus University, Denmark, told Guardian Australia the results showed whale-watching guidelines should include standards for noise levels. Sprogis and colleagues mimicked the movement of a whale-watching boat in the gulf for the experiment, staying at least 100 metres away from the mammals and playing prerecorded engine noise at three volumes. When volumes rose above 160dB underwater, the whales began to show changed behaviours. At the highest volume – 172dB – whale mothers spent 30% less time resting, their breathing rate doubled and their swimming speed rose by 37%. In as-yet-unpublished research, Sprogis said they had recorded 16 whale-watching boats of different designs and while some boats had acceptable volumes, others had engines loud enough to provoke the whales. Exmouth Gulf in the west and Queensland’s Hervey Bay in the east are both important resting grounds for whale mothers as they made their trips south to Antarctica. Sprogis said: “If whales are continuously being woken up from their rest, or if a mother is continuously being disturbed from nursing her calf, then there will be consequences. “So if a stressor is acute or cumulative, then individual effects can lead to population consequences.” There are differences in rules covering whale watching in commonwealth and state waters which look to limit noise. In commonwealth waters, and in the Great Barrier Reef marine park, whale-watching boats should stay 1oo metres from a single whale, or 300 metres from calves, and only approach from the side. Personal watercraft, such as jet skis, and drones need to stay 300 metres away. A “caution zone” 300 metres either side of a whale should not have more than three boats, with speeds restricted to under six knots. New South Wales whale-watching guidelines have the same restrictions, including for calves. In Queensland, boats are also allowed to get within 100 metres of whales, including mothers with calves, with the 300-metre “caution zone” in place. In Western Australia, the rules around distances and speeds are the same as Queensland, with no specific rules stated about calves. In the research, published in the journal eLife, Sprogis and colleagues say a new 150dB noise limit should be introduced to whale watch guidelines. She said: “It is important for the whales to have their rest and not be disturbed by constant stressors. If whale-watching vessels are quiet, then this removes a stressor for the whale, and becomes more of an eco-friendly whale-watching tour with best practice guidelines. Something Australia, and other counties can strive for and be leaders at.” Dr Rebecca Dunlop, a University of Queensland expert on the effects of noise on whales, said it was well known that underwater noise changed the behaviour of whales. She said: “This study has recreated a visit from a whale-watching boat on a mother and calf and that is new. The effects the study observed suggests under particular circumstances, there’s a potential for energetic consequences for the calf – that is, for weight loss caused by reduced feeding if feeding was interrupted. “I’d say the impact on the mother would be negligible – they are pretty robust animals. “But if a calf was repeatedly exposed to visits from boats, then there is the potential for some consequences because the calf needs to consume enough milk to have the energy to deal with a long migration to the Antarctic.” John Peaker, owner of Hervey Bay Whale Watch in Queensland, has been working on whale-watching trips since 1987. Mid-July is the start of the whale watching season in Hervey Bay when humpbacks are heading south. Peaker said it was important to understand any impacts of whale-watching, but was sceptical about the way the study was carried out and the noise levels used. He said boats would often run their engines on idle, or turn them off, once close to a whale. “All the operators I know like to kill their engines as often as possible,” he said. “To me this [study] doesn’t make sense because if you are making a noise, then you are not watching whales. Even when you have engines idling, whales will actually go away if you turn them off. “Not much really bothers the whales. They’re very curious and we’ll have whales with us for an hour at a time. Sometimes they seem to like the engines, sometimes not.” A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment said the guidelines for whale-watching boats in commonwealth waters were designed to “address noise and potential impacts to cetaceans from boat operations and aircraft and include measures to mitigate impacts”. New guidelines were released in 2017 “after comprehensive consultation with state and territory government stakeholders, commercial whale watching operators, scientific experts and the public”. “The guidelines do not identify noise thresholds because of the difficulty in addressing site-specific factors that influence the intensity, duration and extent of underwater acoustic emissions such as water temperature, seabed type and bathymetry. “The current guidelines provide an appropriate balance between managing whale-watching operations and the protection of whales.” A NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment spokesperson said humpback whale populations on the east coast were rising, with a 2020 estimate of 35,000 to 40,000. The spokesperson said: “These positive signs suggest current guidelines and management activities are effective in protecting the species.” A Queensland Department of Environment and Science spokesperson said the humpback whale migration was “one of nature’s great spectacles” which generated “millions of dollars for the Queensland economy”. There were currently no plans to amend the whale watching guidelines in relation to noise levels, the spokesperson said. Commercial whale watching tour operators inside a marine park needed a permit, and outside marine parks “whale watching operators do not require a DES permit but must adhere to approach distances”. Special interest whales, such as the white Migaloo, had stricter rules. “There are strict approach limits which apply to all marine vessels, including whale watching boats, which have been designed to prevent whales being harassed or becoming distressed. “There are strong penalties for breaching these approach limits. On-the-spot fines of $667.25 and a maximum penalty of $16,014 can apply. The maximum penalty for getting too close to a special interest whale is $22,019.25.”"
"A member of a government Covid-19 recovery taskforce has rejected the overwhelming focus on gas as the path out of recession, saying the country risked ending up with stranded fossil fuel infrastructure and should be doing more to back renewable energy. Paul Bastian, national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and a member of a manufacturing taskforce advising the federal government’s handpicked National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC), said gas had a significant role to play, but the importance of cheap clean energy in cutting costs for industry had barely featured in public discussion when it should be “front and centre”. Bastian declined to comment directly on a leaked draft report by the manufacturing taskforce, revealed by Guardian Australia last month, that recommended the Morrison government underwrite a massive expansion of the gas industry, including helping open new fields and build hundreds of kilometres of pipelines, citing a confidentiality agreement. But he confirmed gas had “completely dominated” taskforce discussions, while renewable energy played a much smaller role. He said the government should be focused on setting a path to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris climate agreement. “We think there has been an overemphasis in public discussion about gas and not enough discussion about [other] opportunities that are presented and the need to focus on renewables,” Bastian said. “We could end up with stranded gas assets. There is not enough discussion being taken on how we deal with climate change, how we deal with the shift to renewable energies … We should be taking those advantages now and not later.” The leaked report from the taskforce headed by Andrew Liveris, a former Dow Chemical executive and current board member at oil giant Saudi Aramco, recommended the government underwrite an increased national gas supply, that public agencies partner with companies to accelerate development of new fields and states introduce subsidy schemes for gas-fired power plants. It also proposed a role for government in helping develop gas pipelines between eastern states and the north, and potentially a $6bn trans-Australian pipeline between the east and west, by either taking an equity position, minority share or underwriting investments. It did not consider alternatives to gas, Australia’s emissions reduction targets or the financial risk of investing in fossil fuels as emissions are cut. Gas is usually described as having half the emissions of coal when burned, but recent studies have suggested it could be more. Nev Power, the NCCC chair, distanced the commission from the leaked draft at a Senate inquiry hearing earlier this month. A final manufacturing taskforce report has been submitted to the government and is yet to be made public. Power said the NCCC was not recommending the government subsidise gas, but indicated it was looking at subsidised infrastructure. He has previously backed a cross-continent gas pipeline as a “permanent and low cost long-term solution”. Bastian said the AMWU wanted a domestic gas reservation policy for the eastern states similar to that in place in Western Australia to guarantee a proportion of what was extracted was available locally rather than exported, but did not support subsid schemes for gas-fired power. “They should be reserved for new technologies,” he said. He said Australia, as a resource rich country, had “enormous opportunities” to create employment in clean energy industries, including wind, solar, pumped hydro energy, green hydrogen and lithium batteries. “As a country we’re finally recognising that a diverse economy means having a strong manufacturing base, and in our view the emphasis should be on making that shift, making sure we’re on target for net zero 2050, and seizing that opportunity,” he said. He supported the manufacturing taskforce’s call for an independent manufacturing authority to guide industry development, and the creation of industry hubs that could boost international competitiveness through use of pooled resources. He called on federal and state governments to introduce local procurement policies and bring forward infrastructure projects with a required level of local content. “Any advancement of the manufacturing sector is going to be looking at how it can lower costs using renewables. That should be front and centre, in our view,” Bastian said. Global institutions, banks and investors and a cross-sector collection of groups representing much of Australian society have called for policies geared to drive economic recovery after Covid-19 to also be designed to address the climate crisis. Several countries, including many within the European Union, Canada and South Korea, have promised green recovery measures. But an analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance suggested the majority of stimulus money announced by governments would prop up the fossil fuel economy. Analyses have found Australia could benefit if it rapidly embraced renewable energy to power transport and old and new industries. In his book Superpower, the economist Ross Garnaut made the case that Australia could have an affordable clean electricity system that ran at more than three times its existing capacity and powered a transformed economy, including new industries in mining and minerals processing. Beyond Zero Emissions, a climate change thinktank, found a quick expansion of renewable energy over the next five years could establish clean industries, cut power costs and create more than 100,000 jobs in electricity alone. The Grattan Institute found support for a green steel industry could create tens of thousands of jobs in areas currently reliant on coalmining, particularly central Queensland and the Hunter Valley. ClimateWorks, a not-for-profit organisation, found Australia could reach net zero emissions before 2050 using technologies that were mostly already mature and available. An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report commissioned by governments at the Paris summit found global emissions would need to reach net zero by about 2050 to give the world a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C."
"Following restorative showers and cooler temperatures, encroaching greenery narrows lanes, where leafy shrubs on hedge-banks sprout new growth. Ferns, particularly bracken, overwhelm seeding bluebell and campion, flower spikes of pennywort, and foxglove now past its best. Tendrils of bryony, bedstraw and bramble scramble for light and dog roses are already fading. The first purplish-blue of tufted vetch stands out from the verdure, and the scent of honeysuckle and elderflower draws attention to topmost blooms. Shorn sheep and their fattening lambs no longer seek the shadiest hedges; a farmer reports shearing of his 220 ewes by the two regular specialists in three hours – with the fastest time of just 50 seconds. Before significant rainfall, topping (cutting back coarse, ungrazed vegetation) in the pasture opposite home encourages thicker growth of grass for the South Devon yearlings, moved regularly to avoid overgrazing of each enclosure. In the warmth of May and early June they have thrived, with regular rest times, chewing the cud, and growing noticeably beefier as the weeks go by. After an unusually dull day, the sky clears from the north-west. Early evening sun haloes crowns of hedgerow trees bounding fields beneath the hazy blueness of Hingston Down, already greening up after this year’s early hay cut. This direction of sunlight speaks of the approach of midsummer as we set out, later than usual, on one of our regular walks, venturing eastwards towards the cleft of Danescombe that joins the Tamar. There, former market gardens that grew strawberries and daffodils on sheltered slopes are overcome with regenerated woodland. Ubiquitous bramble flowers promise a good crop of blackberries, emerging between invasive bracken, through willow scrub on slopes cleared of conifers, and in the shade of older trees that mask the ruins of a paper mill, mine dumps and adits burrowed into this precipitous valley. Our path emerges from the gloomy woods to cross dried-up grass stalks, catching the evening light; upslope peeps the Prospect Tower, set against azure sky streaked with cirrus portending more rain. This three-sided 18th-century folly may have been built so that the Edgcumbe family of Cotehele House could signal towards Mount Edgcumbe, miles away downriver on the Rame peninsula. For us, home ground comes into sight – just two miles as the crow flies. "
"My friend Stephen Marks, who has died aged 88, was an architect with a great interest in the history of the subject. As a planning inspector, he was keen to conserve the best of the past, while encouraging sensitive new development. In 1984, he oversaw the controversial public inquiry into the plans for an office block, Mansion House Square, in the City of London, the last design of the architect Mies van Der Rohe. This was a time of regression from the values of the modern movement. That year the Prince of Wales made a speech at the 150th anniversary celebration of the Royal Institute of British Architects at Hampton Court, in which he called the Mies design a “giant glass stump”. Stephen’s recommendation for refusal for the design was upheld by the secretary of state. James Stirling was appointed to design an alternative and the result, No 1 Poultry, an example of postmodernism at its most flamboyant, is now listed. Stephen was born in London. He had strong links to the conservation movement through his maternal grandfather, the architect Albert Powys, a former secretary to the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Stephen’s father, Herbert Marks, unusually for a City accountant, was a perceptive art collector who knew artists including Jacob Epstein and Henry Moore. Herbert may have met Stephen’s mother, Isobel Powys, through Clough Williams-Ellis (of Portmeirion fame), in whose office Isobel was a trainee architect.  After school at Clifton college, in Bristol, and a classics degree at Queen’s College, Oxford, Stephen trained at the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London, headed by the classicist Hector Corfiato, whose teaching was based on the Beaux Arts model. My impression was that Stephen struggled to cast off the rigidity of this training. It may have been because of his historical enthusiasms, shown in his work for the London Topographical Society and the Camberwell Society, that Stephen was selected to be deputy chief conservation officer for Westminster in 1968 from a shortlist of apparently better qualified applicants. With the new powers granted in the 1967 Civic Amenities Act, the Westminster team oversaw the formation of many large conservation areas, and increased the number of listed buildings in the borough, with Stephen writing most of the reports. Stephen had married Tordis Knees, an au pair, in 1959 and they had two children, Edward and Dorothy. The family moved in 1978 to Kilmersdon, in Somerset, where Stephen was instrumental in the creation of the lottery-funded Radstock and North Somerset Coalfield Heritage Museum. He adapted to country living to become an enthusiast for the tree-planting in the hedgerows around the village, persuading farmers, when trimming their hedges, to avoid lopping the saplings. Tordis died in 2019. Stephen is survived by Edward and Dorothy, and by his sister, Antonia, and half-sister, Anna."
"The rain, when it finally arrived, began with a mist of light droplets that scarcely reached the ground before evaporating in the dull heat. As the evening darkened, the temperature dropped sharply and heavy showers delivered substantial rainfall for the first time in many weeks. The air was almost completely still, the only sound the insistent hissing impact of rain on leaves. By morning, the ground was all but dry once more – but when I took the narrow path between the fields of old meadow, the tall grasses at the base of the hedge, heavy with seed, were lodged and flattened by the overnight rain. Across the valley the field of bare soil, where the sloping pasture has been ploughed and reseeded, stood out darkly against the adjacent mown grassland. At the foot of the beech wood, the lane was even less frequented than usual. The foliage here has darkened over the last week, the dappled shade much deeper than before. Bluebell and wood anemone flowers have gone, leaving a dark tangle of encroaching stems as ivy and fern weave across the still-dry banks. The invasive, almost indestructible, brambles have already set fruit – hard, green indicators of the wild harvest to come. Beyond the interlocked canopy of trees, the view of the Rheidol valley widened out. Leaning for a moment on a field gate, I looked over a landscape rich with hedgerows and mature trees. Sheep grazed and dozed on the fringes of the pale, rush-patched meadow, a red kite circling silently overhead while bees explored the pale dog rose flowers in the top of the hedge. Evening brought the return of the rain, with lenses of isolated showers moving across the valley before merging into a homogeneous blur of grey that ate away at the view. The sun was low on the horizon when it cleared, cutting below the level of the cloud and lighting up the hills with clarity and contrast. As the shadows grew, the broad stub of a starkly vivid rainbow appeared briefly in the centre of the scene before fading ahead of the approaching dusk. With the light draining away, a single blackbird sang from the top of the beech tree at the end of the lane."
"For native plants, three similar species of rush are causing a lot of trouble: they are invading uplands, swamping other vegetation, and ruining pasture and the nesting sites of rare birds. The varieties are known as soft, hard and compact rushes and have the Latin names Juncus effusus, J inflexus and J conglomerates respectively. Exactly why they are spreading so fast is uncertain although changing farming practices and a warmer and wetter climate are suspected. Research shows that on the West Pennine moors, a site of special scientific interest, the presence of these rushes in fields has increased by between 81% and 174% in 12 years, in some cases almost eliminating the grass. This invasion is typical of many upland parts of Europe. The rushes are formidable. They grow to 1 metre tall, spread through rhizomes but also produce up to 4m seeds per sq metre, which can germinate decades later. They like poor, badly drained acid grassland, which is made into more suitable habitat by farmers using heavy machinery that crushes the drains installed by Victorian farmers. Sheep compact the land further and the ponies and cattle that used to eat rushes are gone. Lime and burning were once effective treatments but efforts stopped through lack of humanpower. The rushes march on."
"On a wall facing Vicki Ferrini’s desk hangs a giant map of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. At 6ft by 8ft, it’s the largest size available on the printer at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, where she works as a geoinformatics researcher. “I of course want it even bigger,” she says. The map is busier than a usual world map. Rather than showing featureless, flat blue ocean, here the seafloor bursts with detail: mountains, canyons, channels and plains that resemble the texture of land. Ferrini encourages her staff to print pictures of the seafloor features they’re researching and tack them to the map. One example off the coast of Argentina shows ripples in the seafloor reaching a hundred metres high. The map has a distinctly Sherlock Holmes-about-to-break-a-big-case look to it. “I’m trying to see the scale of the ocean,” she explains. “The big picture – but also the fine details.” Mapping requires an ability to see the forest as well as the trees – or in this case, the coral as well as the sea. It’s a particular challenge when it comes to the ocean, the vast majority of which is not just unmapped, but unknown. Ferrini’s map is humanity’s best effort to date: a crucial document in what has become a race to map the entire seafloor by the end of the decade. The race officially kicked off in 2017 at the United Nations Ocean Conference in New York City. When it began, around 6% of the ocean was mapped in accurate detail. On 21 June, the global initiative – known formally as the Nippon Foundation-Gebco Seabed 2030 Project – released its latest edition: it has now mapped one-fifth of the seafloor. The stakes are high. A series of reports have warned of the ocean’s impending collapse. The First World Ocean Assessment, published by the UN Environment Programme in 2015, revealed that the ocean’s very ability to function was in jeopardy. The following year, an OECD report estimated that the ocean economy employed 31 million people full-time and generated $1.5 trillion each year. Maps – or the lack thereof – play a role in nearly every critical ocean issue, from sea level rise to ocean acidification to biodiversity. During the 20th century there were brief bursts of enthusiasm for mapping the sea, including the search for Amelia Earhart’s lost plane, a Lockheed Electra, and the hunt for the wreck of the Titanic. In 2014, the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines MH370 seemed to baffle us: how was it possible that with all our modern technology, something as huge as an entire plane could simply disappear? It’s often said that humanity knows more about the surface of the moon than we do the seafloor. It seems astounding that faraway planets can be more accessible than our own. But we tend to skip over why it is so difficult to map the seafloor: there is a massive obstacle in the way called the ocean. Light travels far and fast in space, but the laser altimeters that we use to chart celestial bodies are ineffective in water – the lasers are simply absorbed. Sound, on the other hand, travels more efficiently underwater than it does in air. The gold standard for seafloor mapping today is a multi-beam echosounder, which can be attached directly on to the hull of a ship. The device sends down a fan of sound waves, which computers decipher into a three-dimensional portrait of the seafloor’s shape and composition. Additional techniques also collect water temperature and salinity along the way. It is slow work. Ferrini recently sent another version of the map, this one blacking out all the uncharted ocean today. The coastlines were lit up with data. So, too, were well-traversed shipping lanes. The rest sat in darkness, except for a few pinpricks of light. Few countries need accurate maps of the seabed more than Japan, an island nation whose future is uniquely intertwined with the ocean’s, and it is the Nippon Foundation , a Japanese non-profit organisation run on the gambling proceeds of motorboat racing, that is backing Seabed 2030 with $2m every year. In the past, the foundation has addressed thorny global challenges such as eliminating leprosy or fighting food insecurity, and a complete seafloor map fits within its mandate, as well as Japan’s wider national interests. Seabed 2030 would improve Japan’s fisheries management and its tsunami and typhoon preparation, as well as clarify territorial claims in the South China Sea. But the mapping is a truly global collaboration, public and free to use, divided among four regional centres. The Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany took the Southern Ocean; Stockholm University and the University of New Hampshire cover the North Pacific and Arctic; New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research are responsible for the South and West Pacific Ocean. That leaves the largest swath, the entire Atlantic and Indian Oceans, to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University – Ferrini’s team. The finished map itself is created by a fifth centre, based in the UK: the British Oceanographic Data Centre in Southampton. It collects the analysed data from the four centres and compiles it in the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (Gebco). The data is in the public domain, free to use, adapt and commercially exploit. “Pretty much anybody doing some kind of [ocean] research should probably be using or has used the Gebco data,” says Rochelle Wigley, the project’s director at the University of New Hampshire. “A lot of fibre optic cable companies have used it, people interested in tsunamis and storm surge, people looking to characterise habitat or modelling ocean currents.” It is making remarkable new discoveries all the time. Off Florida, a reef of mid-ocean corals turned up; in the Gulf of Mexico, a shipwreck. A forthcoming study on ice sheets will use Gebco to unpack how the ocean influences melting and raises sea levels.  Deep-sea mining – a controversial plan to excavate huge areas of underwater resources, in what would be the largest mining operation the Earth has ever seen – requires maps, too. The UN’s International Seabed Authority (ISA) has given permission to several state-owned and private companies to prospect in the deep sea; permission to start mining could come as soon as this year. In many cases, however, the deep-sea miners are way ahead of the Gebco mappers. Luc Cuyvers, lead author of the IUCN’s 2018 report on seabed mining, says mining companies are looking for specific things – hard evidence of minerals, either visual or actual samples. “From an industry perspective, they need more advanced data” than Gebco, he says. “And [they] have, in many instances, already collected it.” Where Gebco could be used in deep-sea mining, however, would be to help the ISA to better regulate the industry, he says – something of a double-edged sword, depending on your point of view. Another potential controversy is whether mapping introduces more noise to an already noisy ocean. Air guns, naval sonar and shipping traffic are increasingly edging out marine mammals that rely on sound to hunt, navigate and communicate. New research from graduate student Hilary Kates Varghese at the University of New Hampshire revealed that the multi-beam echosounders used by Seabed 2030 did not disrupt the feeding behaviour of Cuvier’s beaked whale, one of the more sonically sensitive marine mammals. However, research biologist Annamaria DeAngelis at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out that because Seabed 2030 is mapping the entire ocean, “more studies will be needed to expand our knowledge of how their particular echosounders will affect marine mammals in a variety of habitats.” One way to reduce noise is to crowdsource from ships that are already charting the ocean. When the multimillionaire Victor Vescovo went on a mission to reach the deepest point of all five oceans, Seabed 2030 mappers collected soundings along the journey. Other industry partners are donating whatever data they can. Crowdsourcing is crucial – from cruise ships, hydrographic offices, even weekend boaters with a decent sounder. By itself, a single ship would need 200 years to map the rest of the uncharted seas. However, “sharing data is a little taboo”, says Tinah Voahangy Martin, a member of Ferrini’s staff who often approaches institutions located on the Indian Ocean to ask for seafloor information. Seafloor data is often considered proprietary, classified or simply too valuable to give away. “You don’t want to be the person who comes in and says ‘Hi, you do this and we expect this.’ You take them on as a partner. That’s the best way to get them involved.” Ferrini adds that, because science in the US is often taxpayer-funded, it creates the expectation that data will always be freely available. “We have to remind ourselves that the whole world doesn’t work that way, and figure out how we can make it mutually beneficial.” Nevertheless, at their rate of progress, the finish line of 2030 seems possible. But completing the map on Ferrini’s wall is just the beginning. “There’s still so much more for us to do and know than the shape of the seafloor,” she says. “This is just one piece of a much bigger picture.”"
"Name: Swan love. Age: This story begins four years ago. Go on then. Once upon a time – well, in 2016, obviously – a pair of swans lived on a lake on the heath, in the village of Hampstead … One of the poshest bits of London. Well-heeled swans, then? Not important; what is important is that they were very much in love. How do you know? Because this is a love story. And because swans often mate for life.  And they lived happily ever after, the end? No – although it was the end for one of them. Mr Swan flew into a building and died. Probably forgot how long his neck was. Did he sing something before waddling off, because if he did it would have been his swan song. Oi! It is sad. If we are doing music, make it Camille Saint-Saëns’s Le Cygne. Or just the famous bit from Swan Lake. Anyway, poor Mrs Widow Swan was heartbroken. Her nest of unfertilised eggs never hatched. She lived alone, grieving, for four years. God, it is sad. It gets worse before it gets better. Also, look out for the Ikea bag. Always useful. Carry on, then. Earlier this year, another swan couple showed up at the lake.  The cheek of it! How did poor Mrs Swan react? She disappeared; no one knew where to. Perhaps she had been killed by the intruders. Noooo! Had she? No. She turned up on a nearby roof.  How do we know all this, by the way? It all came to light on a thread on the park’s Twitter feed. It became quite a thing, for romantics and swan enthusiasts. How did they get her down? They didn’t! They were trying to rescue her, not make a duvet out of her. No, bird brain – how did they get her down from the roof? Oh, I see. In an Ikea bag. Spotted! There it is. Yes, they make excellent swan carriers, apparently. She was taken to the Swan Sanctuary to recuperate. And to find love again … No way! Way. There was a male there, name of Wallace (some swans have names, others don’t). He was recovering from a fight. And they, you know, hooked up.  Any necking involved? Stop it! Anyway, when it came time for our swan to be taken home to Hampstead, the Sanctuary people decided to take Wallace, too. In Ikea bags? Obviously. And then? They made a new home together, away from the imposters, on the other side of the heath, literally nested. And it gets better still … Yes! Please can there be … baby swanlets?! Well, cygnets. Six of them, apparently, fluffy and grey.  Do say: “Yes, hello, Disney studios? I’ve got a story I think you might be interested in.” Don’t say: “Horrid things. Is it true they can break your arm?”"
"When the Neameh sailed out of Colombia on 4 May, it should have been a routine shipment: just over 4,000 cattle, on their way to Egypt, an important hub for the global trade in live animal exports. But accusations of cocaine smuggling and a police raid of the ship lengthened the journey. As the Neameh sailed into the mouth of the Mediterranean in the early hours of 21 May, it was apprehended close to Gibraltar by Spanish customs agents and the Spanish navy on suspicion of cocaine trafficking. Spain’s health ministry did not allow any of the cattle to disembark, or the offloading any carcasses, while customs and police searching the ship were unable to use sniffer dogs because of the stench. The Spanish news agency Efe said agents required breathing apparatus to search the bowels of the ship. Conditions on the ship, which sails under a Panamanian flag, were unbearable according to multiple local news reports, with the animals crowded on board. “The strong stench was noticeable tens of metres from the ship,” said the Algeciras-based news outlet Europa Sur. “Many of the animals lay dead on the ground for several days among urine, faeces and feed, decomposing. Many others were in agonising pain, with no remedy.”  “It was hell,” one witness told Europa Sur, describing a scene of overcrowding and animals “barely able to stand on their feet”. The Spanish interior ministry referred requests for comment to the police, who did not respond to questions about the operation or its outcome.  The search was eventually called off and, without public explanation, the ship continued its journey the next morning.  By the time the vessel docked in Damietta on Egypt’s northern coast, according to the ship’s records, 34 animals had died, although their bodies were not on the boat.  Officials from the Egyptian agriculture ministry who inspected the vessel on arrival in Damietta on 29 May described the animals as being in a “miserable condition”. Photographs show cattle packed into the ship in dirty and crowded conditions, prompting concerns for their health and wellbeing. Hijazi & Ghosheh, the trading company that operates a fleet of ships – including the Neameh – transporting livestock, tell a different story to the Spanish press. “When the captain came to the bridge [the police] immediately hit him – this is not a way to investigate a suspect,” said Ayat Shawkat, fleet manager for the Neameh and its crew. “They hit him with a machine gun. Everyone has a right to investigate, but not to harm people. This was barbaric.”  Some of the 42 crew members were forcibly sequestered in one part of the ship, he said, while others were taken to a nearby police station. While 20 were normally tasked with taking care of the livestock, just three or four labourers were permitted to care for the animals while the search took place.  The ones chosen were apparently unfamiliar with what needed to be done to keep them safe and healthy. “They couldn’t conduct proper feeding and watering,” he said. “The cattle lay down, but normal practice is to get them up and then put out the feed so that no cattle jump on top of one another. When they do this with so few people these things happen. It’s a big issue.” The result, he claimed, was poor conditions on board.  Shawkat rejected any suggestions that lack of care for the animals prior to their unexpected arrival in Spain was responsible for the distressing conditions witnessed in Algeciras. Instead he blamed the unplanned stop for the problems. “During the search they spoiled the feed,” he said. “There was a limited amount for the destination. But with these delays … it’s hell what happened to the ship, it was in really bad shape. For animal welfare, it’s a big violation.”  He also dismissed any possibility that the Neameh was smuggling cocaine, or that the poor conditions on board could have made it easier to hide a cache of drugs. “I don’t think so,” he said. “For one reason, there was no one allowed to go on board [in Colombia] due to Covid-19, and no one allowed to leave the ship. It’s out of the question.”   Multiple Colombian government agencies did not respond to requests for comment about the Neameh smuggling cocaine.  The tale raises questions about links between the global narcotics trade and the animal industry. In Colombia in the 80s, for example, Pablo Escobar’s cartel was reported to have strong links with the Colombian Cattlemen’s Association. More recently, a 2014 statement by the head of the Central American Federation of Meat Producers detailed cocaine smuggling from Nicaragua to Mexico with the drug hidden in the intestines of cattle.   But it also raises questions about the effectiveness of the patchy regulations in place for the live animal export trade. Why, critically, was the ship allowed to leave Spain when conditions potentially breached EU regulations which say that animals being transported in or out of the EU must comply with animal welfare standards? “The Neameh only obtained attention by authorities and the media because of the suspicion of drug trafficking. However, vessels like Neameh transport animals across the globe every day and mostly remain unnoticed by the public,” said Sophie Greger of Animals’ Angels, which works to protect animals from live transport.  Throwing dead cattle overboard from freighters is illegal on the Mediterranean, where the practice sometimes results in carcasses washing ashore in coastal towns or on islands like Menorca. Shawkat did not respond to additional questions about what happened to the carcasses, or why the 34 dead cattle were not on board the ship in Damietta. "
"Where nature is concerned, expect the unexpected. One day I was listening for cuckoos on the moors above my home, the next I was having surgery on a part of my body I didn’t know existed. After a week in hospital, I was returned to my garden, quietly grateful and as weak as an infant, to lie on the grass in a blissful daze and watch insects busying themselves among the flowers. I had never properly stopped to notice how many and what kinds our little patch supports: bumblebees, among them common carders, miner bees, butterflies, solitary wasps, ants marching over my legs, beetles muscling through the wild strawberries. One small drama in particular held my attention: a single male mayfly, pulsing up into the air and drifting back down. As it floated towards my feet, the mayfly’s elongated front legs, used for grasping the female during mating, and its even longer tail appendages, called cerci, bent into an arc – an improbable contraption for flight. Yet when it pushed itself back into the air, it did so almost without effort on slender, transparent wings. As a young fly-fisherman, I spent hours tying March brown mayflies to catch trout; the life cycle of these insects became a fascination to me. This one was another species, even more common, Ephemera danica; one clue being those immensely long front legs, a particular feature of the mature adult. Mayflies go through four stages, from egg to nymph, the longest portion of its life, spent in or near rivers and ponds, to a brief intermediary stage, the subimago, known to anglers as a dun, a sexually immature adult that emerges on the surface of the water. When its new wings are dry, it flies somewhere sheltered to shed one more exoskeleton. Then it becomes an imago, or spinner, a fully reproductive mayfly that will live at most a very few days. In these final hours, the mayfly has no functioning mouthparts because it doesn’t need to eat. It has one compulsion: to mate and then die. Perhaps the whole convoluted business had been in vain for this fellow. There were no females nearby to impress. But the possibility of something more kept lifting him back into the summer sky."
"My mum fist-pumped when I told her I had seen a barn owl using a nest box on our farm. She has been trying to coax them in since she moved here 35 years ago.  There were signs the owls might be thinking of settling down – we found a pellet (regurgitated fur and bones from rodents) at the base of a nest box in February and splatters of poo below another box. Then last week the eureka moment came when one flew out of a box.  My brother built the first boxes (along with a few dozen broody chicken coops) 17 years ago as a punishment for getting suspended from school. Dad built a few more during a brief attempt at retirement and now we have eight of these bulky boxes nestled in the boughs of oak trees around our Kent farm.  Lynne and Peter Flower – who volunteer for Kent Wildlife Trust and are licensed with the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) to monitor boxes in the local area – came to look inside ours and found various bit of avian paraphernalia, including sticks brought in by a jackdaw, an egg (probably from a stock dove) and pellets (which barn owls shred to make nests). A kestrel had claimed one of the other boxes as its own.  Monitoring nests is crucial because it provides the BTO with information about where the species is doing well. Before climbing the ladder to peer into the nest, the Flowers scraped a stick around the bottom of the tree to let the barn owl know it had visitors. Barn owls are generally gentle, unlike tawny owls which can be aggressive.  Our owls are not yet nesting and were not at home when the Flowers visited. They might not have decided about their partners, but the presence of pellets in a number of boxes suggests they are thinking about it. “They’re as fussy as we are, they won’t take just anybody,” says Lynne. Our mini success is one that has been repeated all over the country. In 1987 barn owls were at their lowest ebb with around 4,500 breeding pairs, having declined by 70% since 1932. Now there are up to an estimated 12,000 breeding pairs in the UK.  Historically, these distinctive birds with their heart-shaped faces, demonic shriek and silent flight, would have been a farmer’s friend because they gobble up rodents. Special “owl windows” were even created in barns to encourage them to nestle in between beams and loft spaces. But from the mid 1800s, agriculture was intensified and tussocky grasses full of mice and shrews were ironed out.  In 1988 their fortunes started to change again thanks to the work of Colin Shawyer, who set up the Barn Owl Conservation Network with the aim of doubling the population by 2020. For the first decade his team focused on recreating habitats but by the mid-1990s he realised it was nesting sites barn owls needed the most – old barns had been demolished or renovated, and councils had chopped down cavernous old trees where the birds might have lived. More than 20,000 boxes have been put up nationally, with Shawyer installing 4,000 personally. “It’s still a great privilege to get up to a box and see it’s being used, with five chicks looking out at you. We are fortunate, as it is a species that has big charisma and appeal,” he says.  Every county in the UK has someone putting up barn owl boxes. In 2013, Kent Wildlife Trust decided the barn owl would be its flagship species – the logic was that promoting habitats for barn owls was good for lots of other wildlife too – and built aabout 40 boxes around the Sevenoaks area, during which time the population has increased. Lots of barn owls are nesting late this year. Historically, owl numbers rose and fell with field vole populations. Shawyer says: “Once upon a time I could predict from one year to the next when they’d start breeding and how successful they’d be. In the past six years it’s been all over the show.” He’s not sure why these changes are happening, but says it could be down to climatic extremes. Lockdown may be good for barn owls – reduced noise from traffic may allow them to hunt more efficiently and there will probably have been fewer road deaths. “Lots of barn owls are killed on the road because they’re not looking – they’re listening and looking at the ground,” says Lynne. Owls look quite angelic but they live a savage existence, never far from hunger. They incubate eggs as soon as they lay them so the birth of their chicks is staggered; in tough years only the oldest will survive and the rest will starve. In times of plenty the whole brood flourishes. They feed their chicks for 50 days, by which time they need space to stretch their legs and gain strength, which is why some of the more elaborate nest boxes have little balconies attached.  Barn owls are modern families. “We’ve found that a pair might become quite loyal to a box and while they’re pairing up and mating, they’ll be in the box. If a female starts laying, the male will often roost somewhere else,” says Lynne. “Once they’ve got young he will definitely move somewhere else and he will bring in food. When the young get really big she will also roost somewhere else possibly, so all these roost sites are really important to them.”  Like much of the country, Kent has got its barn owls back, and their boxes are an eccentric addition to the countryside. Andrew Lewis, who lives in Sevenoaks, got in touch with the Guardian to share his lockdown picture of a local barn owl hunting on the fields next to his residential street. The fields have been left fallow and barn owls are now regular visitors.  He says: “We do sometimes feel like frauds when watching wildlife diaries at the end of David Attenborough, as they explain the trials and tribulations of capturing footage. We sit down with a cup of tea until the owl appears and then I change out of my dressing gown, nip down to the back fence and get some photos while it spends up to an hour hunting.” Through an army of dedicated local volunteers, Shawyer’s ambitious targets have been smashed: barn owl numbers have nearly tripled and he doubts they will be able to climb much higher. Up to 80% of barn owls now nest in man-made boxes. “If all those boxes fell down we’d probably see extinction. I don’t know of any other species that is so reliant on one component of their habitat – a nest box – for their survival, and that’s all done by people,” says Shawyer.

"A landmark court judgment that a government forestry agency repeatedly breached conservation regulations has sparked calls for a review of an industry-wide exemption for logging under national environment laws. Last week the federal court found VicForests, a body owned by Victorian taxpayers, breached a code of practice in a regional forestry agreement (RFA) between the federal and state governments covering the state’s central highlands. It means for the first time in 20 years, forestry operations may have to be assessed under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. Forestry is exempt from the act under the terms of RFAs in place in four states. Mortimer found past and planned logging by VicForests would have a significant impact on the vulnerable greater glider and the critically endangered Leadbeater’s possum, and the agency had breached a code of practice by not observing a precautionary principle relating to environmental conservation. Campaigners, legal experts and state and federal governments are still considering the implications of Justice Debra Mortimer’s 444-page judgment, published last Wednesday, and the court is yet to issue final orders in the case. Some familiar with the case believed the judgment would have ramifications beyond Victoria’s central highlands. Jess Abrahams, a national campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said it had “torn a gaping hole” in the exemption granted to forestry. He called on businessman Graeme Samuel, who is leading a once-a-decade review of the EPBC Act, to address the exemption when he makes recommendations to the federal government later this year. “Graeme Samuel can’t pretend that this isn’t a major failing in the act and he’s going to have to make recommendations to fix it in one way or another,” Abrahams said. “Environmentalists have been pointing to this law for a long time and saying the consequence is the environment is being destroyed and species are being sent to extinction.” Lee Godden, the director of Melbourne University’s centre for resources, energy and environmental law, said Mortimer’s reference to the precautionary principle could have wider implications for the forestry industry and the way it prepared for logging. She said the judgment concluded VicForests’ use of desktop surveys to identify where threatened species were found was flawed, and found more comprehensive on-ground surveys were necessary. “Part of what needs to be considered very strongly in the EPBC review is this exemption,” Godden said. “The fundamental thing is [VicForests is] not carrying out that rigorous scientific work to establish whether those species are there or not, and that would seem fundamental to why that exemption is granted.” Samuel declined to comment while the review was still under way. The Wilderness Society said it was unclear in the wake of the judgment whether any native forest logging in Australia was being carried out legally. “We definitely think this has very significant implications for logging under RFAs everywhere,” Amelia Young, the national campaigns director, said. “No one can guarantee with any degree of certainty that logging in any situation would have been lawful. It is clear that the precautionary principle has not been applied in Victoria.” Young said conservationists would look closely at Tasmania, where logging had been carried out in the habitat of the swift parrot and other endangered species. Veteran environmentalist Lyndon Schneiders, now working as a consultant to the Places You Love Alliance, said communities, legal teams and campaigners would be examining the prescriptions and schemes in individual states. “If I was in Tasmania I would be wanting to make sure that my forest agency wasn’t logging threatened species habitat right now and likewise in New South Wales,” he said. The forestry industry has called on state and federal governments to clarify what the judgment means for logging. A VicForests spokesman said it would carefully consider the implications. The Tasmanian resources minister, Guy Barnett, last week said the government was considering the judgment, but its advice to date was that it was specific to Victoria. “We have every confidence in the resource security legislation in Tasmania, and the regional forest agreement in Tasmania,” he said. A spokesman for Victoria’s resources minister, Jaclyn Symes, said the state government would take “the necessary time” to consider the ruling. The former Greens leader Bob Brown, an environmental campaigner since the 1970s, said groups in each state covered by RFAs – Victoria, Tasmania, NSW and Western Australia – would be examining the case. He said it was an “unmissable opportunity” for Victoria to bring forward its plan to phase out native forest logging by 2030. Brown won a 2007 federal court case against logging in Tasmania’s Wielangta forest on the grounds it would destroy habitat of the swift parrot, the broad-toothed stag beetle and the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle, but the judgment was overturned on appeal. He said there was a long list of endangered species in Tasmanian forests, and habitat was still being logged in forests in the Tarkine, in the state’s north-west, and in the south. “The reality of it is all major forest logging in Australia should stop,” Brown said. “It is a prime cause of the march towards extinction.”"
"The sixth mass extinction of wildlife on Earth is accelerating, according to an analysis by scientists who warn it may be a tipping point for the collapse of civilisation. More than 500 species of land animals were found to be on the brink of extinction and likely to be lost within 20 years. In comparison, the same number were lost over the whole of the last century. Without the human destruction of nature, even this rate of loss would have taken thousands of years, the scientists said. The land vertebrates on the verge of extinction, with fewer than 1,000 individuals left, include the Sumatran rhino, the Clarión wren, the Española giant tortoise and the harlequin frog. Historic data was available for 77 of the species and the scientists found these had lost 94% of their populations. The researchers also warned of a domino effect, with the loss of one species tipping others that depend on it over the edge. “Extinction breeds extinctions,” they said, noting that unlike other environmental problems extinction is irreversible. Humanity relies on biodiversity for its health and wellbeing, scientists said, with the coronavirus pandemic an extreme example of the dangers of ravaging the natural world. Rising human population, destruction of habitats, the wildlife trade, pollution and the climate crisis must all be urgently tackled, they said. “When humanity exterminates other creatures, it is sawing off the limb on which it is sitting, destroying working parts of our own life-support system,” said Prof Paul Ehrlich, of Stanford University in the US, and one of the research team. “The conservation of endangered species should be elevated to a global emergency for governments and institutions, equal to the climate disruption to which it is linked.” “We are facing our final opportunity to ensure that the many services nature provides us do not get irretrievably sabotaged,” said Prof Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who led the research.  The analysis, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined data on 29,400 land vertebrate species compiled by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and BirdLife International. The researchers identified 515 species with populations below 1,000 and about half of these had fewer than 250 remaining. Most of these mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians were found in tropical and subtropical regions. Scientists discovered that 388 species of land vertebrate had populations under 5,000, and the vast majority (84%) lived in the same regions as the species with populations under 1,000, creating the conditions for a domino effect. Known examples of this include the overhunting of sea otters, the main predator of kelp-eating sea urchins. A boom in urchins devastated kelp forests in the Bering Sea, leading to the extinction of the kelp-eating Steller’s sea cow. The researchers said their findings could aid conservation efforts by highlighting the species and regions requiring the most urgent attention.  Prof Andy Purvis, at the Natural History Museum in London, and not part of the new analysis, said: “This research provides another line of evidence that the biodiversity crisis is accelerating. The hardest problem [the researchers] faced is that we don’t know more about the history of species’ geographic distributions. They only had that information for 77 of the species on the brink, and we can’t know for sure how typical those species are.”  “But that doesn’t undermine the conclusion,” he said. “The biodiversity crisis is real and urgent. But – and this is the crucial point – it is not too late. To transition to a sustainable world, we need to tread more lightly on the planet. Until then, we are essentially robbing future generations of their inheritance.”  Prof Georgina Mace, of University College London, said: “This new analysis re-emphasises some startling facts about the extent to which vertebrate populations have been reduced worldwide by human activities.” But she said she was not convinced that simply having a population less than 1,000 was the best measure of a species being on the brink. A declining trend for the population is also important and both factors are used in the IUCN Red List, she said. “Action is important for many reasons, not least of which is that directly and indirectly we rely on the rest of life on Earth for our own health and wellbeing,” she said. “Disrupting nature leads to costly and often hard-to-reverse effects. Covid-19 is an extreme present-day example, but there are many more.” Mark Wright, the director of science at WWF, said: “The numbers in this research are shocking. However, there is still hope. If we stop the land-grabbing and devastating deforestation in countries such as Brazil, we can start to bend the curve in biodiversity loss and climate change. But we need global ambition to do that.”"
"Air pollution must be kept at low levels to help avoid a second peak of coronavirus infections, according to a cross-party report from MPs. There is growing evidence from around the world linking exposure to dirty air and increased infections and deaths from Covid-19. Lockdowns cut air pollution levels in many places, but the MPs said measures were needed to ensure it remains low. The report is based on evidence from scientists, businesses and local authorities and proposes a series of actions, including the continuation of home working, increased cycle lanes and training, more frequent public transport services to avoid crowding and the phasing out of wood and coal burning in homes. It also urges the rollout of clean air zones, currently delayed by the pandemic, and a scrappage scheme for dirty vehicles. The launch of the report also revealed new evidence of a biological mechanism that could explain how air pollution increases Covid-19 infections and the suggestion that pollution could help explain why certain minority ethnic groups have been more affected by the virus.  “We need a wide-ranging air quality response as we emerge from lockdown and not an accentuated Covid-19 second peak because people get into their cars instead of using public transport or working from home,” said MP Geraint Davies, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on air pollution. “Some proposals can be introduced immediately and will help to ensure that a second peak does not overwhelm the NHS,” he said. “All will deliver cleaner air over subsequent years to help to ensure better public health and greater resilience against future pandemics.” Davies said measures to reduce pollution, such as travelling less, were the same as those that reduced contact between people and therefore the risk of infection. “They go hand in hand,” he said. The report will be submitted to government. Davies said: “This is something that should be on the prime minister’s desk and taken very seriously.” Prof Jonathan Grigg of Queen Mary University of London said: “It is increasingly likely that air pollution increases vulnerability to Covid-19 infection. Preventing the most polluting traffic from re-emerging on to our roads should therefore be part of Covid-19 policy.” He told the launch event that his new laboratory research had shown short-term exposure of airway cells to pollution particles from traffic increased the number of the ACE2 receptors that coronavirus hijacks to enter the body. “We showed a highly significant increase,” he said. The next step in the research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, is to confirm that virus infection does increase in these cells. “I would be surprised if it didn’t,” Grigg said. Also speaking at the launch event were researchers from Harvard University in the US, whose research indicates that even a tiny, single-unit increase in particle pollution levels in the years before the pandemic is associated with a significant increase in the death rate. “Air pollution and Covid-19 are even more dangerous together,” said Rachel Nethery at Harvard. “This information can help us prepare by encouraging these populations in areas with higher air pollution to take extra precautions and allocating extra resources.” She said air pollution might help explain the differences being seen in Covid-19 mortality rates between different racial groups. “People of colour and poor people are disproportionately affected by air pollution,” she said. The Harvard team initially estimated the rise in death rate associated with a single-unit increase in fine particle pollution at 15%. But further analysis, taking into account a wider range of other factors, reduced this to 8%, still a significant increase.  Xiao Wu, another member of the Harvard team, said the result was consistent between both rural and urban areas, and between different statistical approaches. The team have also found similar results for nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant produced by diesel vehicles and at illegal levels in most urban areas in the UK. Prof Alastair Lewis, at the University of York and chair of the UK government’s air quality expert group, also spoke at the launch event. He said: “The changes seen in some air pollutants during lockdown have been dramatic and give an indication of what should be possible for the UK in the future.”"
"The European commission will launch a sweeping effort to tackle the global biodiversity crisis on Wednesday, including a call for 3bn trees to be planted in the EU by 2030 and a plan to better protect the continent’s last primeval forests. The draft policy document, published online by an environmental NGO, admits that to date in the EU, “protection has been incomplete, restoration has been small-scale, and the implementation and enforcement of legislation has been insufficient”. Scientists and environmental groups, commenting on the leaked draft of the strategy, say that while the new goals are welcome and impressive, there is a still distinct lack of tools with which to implement them. “It’s a good and ambitious document, but what is also obvious is the lack of strategy of how to implement it, and a lack of discussion of why previous documents of this type failed,” said Przemysław Chylarecki of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The new strategy calls for nearly one-third of EU land and sea to become protected zones. Currently, 26% of land and 11% of seas are classed as protected areas, but the European commission acknowledges this has not been enough to tackle the degradation of the natural world and threat of extinction to some birds and animals. Environmentalists say even these previous targets for protection have not been met in practice. “The proposed strategy lacks game-changing ideas and instruments for reaching the targets. We already know today that existing frameworks are not delivering, so why should we wait,” said Robert Cyglicki, programme director of Greenpeace in central and eastern Europe.  He welcomed the new strategy but said it would be 2024 before it became clear if new binding measures would be adopted, and called for immediate discussions over funding and enforcement mechanisms. Some elements of the programme, such as protecting migratory bird populations, are hard to implement without a global approach, and the paper calls on the EU to intensify efforts to make biodiversity a central part of its diplomacy.  It concludes that global efforts to tackle the biodiversity crisis under the auspices of the UN have been “insufficient to halt the loss of the world’s biodiversity”. It will also turn the spotlight on the EU’s €60bn-a-year common agricultural policy, which has been criticised for fuelling a steep decline in nature, with a call for a quarter of the EU’s agricultural land to be organically farmed by 2030. Environmentalists warned the plan’s headline target to plant at least 3bn trees by 2030, “in full respect of ecological principles”, should only be a small part of the solution. “Planting 3bn trees is a really spectacular and visual goal, but it has been shown that planting new trees is not a panacea and doesn’t always help,” said Chylarecki. More important will be the goal to map, monitor and “strictly protect” the EU’s last remaining primeval forests, which have survived in almost every member state, but remain threatened by human activity, such as illegal logging. These older forests provide a natural shield against climate change, but in many countries have been preyed on by logging companies, with national governments either ignoring the situation or lacking the resources to properly police logging. “We believe an integrated approach that also includes smart financial mechanisms and social aspects is the key aspect of a future European biodiversity governance framework,” said Romania’s environment minister, Costel Alexe, who has said he wants to better protect the large area of old-growth forests in the country. César Luena, a Spanish socialist MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, agreed that the 2030 targets “will need to be covered by legislation to make them binding” on member states. “If the new strategy remains just a collection of ideas, nothing will ever happen,” he said in emailed comments. He said the strategy “seems more ambitious than the previous one but there are still areas for improvement”. Luena said EU member states needed to comply with existing laws, noting that in the last week alone, the European commission launched legal action against 19 governments over failures on EU environmental law – a tally of charges far from unusual in the commission’s monthly round up of infringement proceedings. Sweden and Latvia have been accused of not implementing parts of the EU’s birds and habitats directives, Malta is faulted for not conserving endangered bluefin tuna, while France, Cyprus and Lithuania are said to have neglected to write EU air pollution standards into national law. The EU should also offer funding benefits for those governments serious about hitting targets, said campaigners. “At the EU level we need some sort of financial stimulus that would make it attractive for countries to focus on biodiversity,” said Marta Grundland, a campaigner with Greenpeace Poland.  “Right now, I don’t feel it’s a EU priority or a national priority. After climate this is the second biggest threat we are facing, and it’s all connected. If we want to help with the climate crisis we should also tackle the biodiversity crisis.”"
"More than 10 million hens are estimated to have been culled due to Covid-19 related slaughterhouse shutdowns. The majority will have been smothered by a water-based foam, similar to fire-fighting foam, a method that animal welfare groups are calling “inhumane”. The pork industry has warned that more than 10 million pigs could be culled by September for the same reason. The techniques used to cull pigs include gassing, shooting, anaesthetic overdose, or “blunt force trauma”. In “constrained circumstances”, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), techniques [pdf] might also include a combination of shutting down pig barn ventilator systems with the addition of CO2 so the animals suffocate. The ‘depopulation’ comes despite food banks across the US reporting unprecedented demand and widespread hunger during the pandemic, with six-mile-long queues for aid forming at some newly set up distribution centres. The American meat supply chain has been hit hard by the closure of slaughterhouses, due to Covid-19 infection rates among workers. 30 to 40 plants have closed, which means that in the highly consolidated US system beef and pork slaughtering capacity has been cut by 25% and 40% respectively, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). The closures have meant that animals cannot be killed for food and many must instead be culled, or “depopulated” at home. As it is comparatively easier to keep cattle on farms, cow culls do not appear to be an issue as yet, and the chicken cull may have peaked, said Adam Speck, an agribusiness analyst with IHS Markit. “[Cattle] could stay on ranches another six months if necessary. The peak of the chicken cull has passed for now. North of about 10 million chickens were depopulated, either at the chick or egg stage,” Speck said. At the hen stage, Leah Garcés, president of US welfare organisation Mercy for Animals, said it is hard to be sure of the numbers. But, “what we know with certainty is that 2 million meat chickens [and] 61,000 laying hens”, have been killed on farms. Compared with poultry, said Garcés, stopping or slowing the production cycle of pigs is harder, mainly because pig growing periods are about six months compared to six weeks for hens. “Pregnancies had already been set in motion when the slaughterhouse closures occurred,” she said, and pigs were already in the system. The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) has estimated that: “up to 10,069,000 market hogs will need to be euthanised between the weeks ending on 25 April and 19 September 2020, resulting in a severe emotional and financial toll on hog farmers”. For pig culls, AVMA “preferred methods” include injectable anaesthetic overdose, gassing, shooting with guns or bolts, electrocution and manual blunt force trauma. AVMA methods “permitted in constrained circumstances” include ventilator shutdown (VSD), potentially combined with carbon dioxide gassing, and sodium nitrite which would be ingested by pigs. Speaking more graphically, Garcés said manual blunt force trauma can mean slamming piglets against the ground while VSD would “essentially cook the pigs alive”. Asked to estimate numbers of pigs that have already been culled, Speck said producers are very reluctant to depopulate. “About two million might have been culled so far due to the Covid-19 pandemic, over the last six or so weeks.” Speck added that with slaughterhouses likely to return to 85% capacity by the end of May, the NPPC’s depopulation estimate of 10 million pigs could be significantly reduced. Speck said breeders are thinning herds and slowing growth to reduce pig supply. “They are sending breeding sows to slaughter, aborting pregnant sows on a small scale and [keeping market-bound pigs] on maintenance style rations with less protein. Coming into the summer months the pigs will also gain weight more slowly as the weather heats up.” Asked about growth slowdown, Garcés said it posed other welfare risks. “One method to slow down growth is to turn the heat up inside of the warehouses beyond the pigs ‘comfort zone’ because pigs eat less when they are too hot,” she said. The combination of feed restrictions and higher barn temperatures, she said, mean pigs are “hungry and hot, increasing their overall discomfort, which is already high in a factory farm setting”. In what appears to be an attempt by the industry to reduce any negative depopulation impact, a blog managed by the National Pork Board called Real Pig Farming offers social media sharing tips for farmers. The blog suggests farmers: “Think twice before engaging with posts that show what may be happening on farms right now.”It said: “Most people do not understand the complexity of raising pigs and getting pork from the farm to their table. That means, “[a] good rule of thumb is to speak to a level a third grader [eight to 10 years old] would understand to ensure that things are not taken out of context.”NPPC spokesperson Jim Monroe said that as of the week ending on 15 May, less than 25% of overall slaughter capacity was idled and the situation was improving. Monroe, added that the “tragic need to euthanise animals is to prevent animal suffering.”For poultry, culling options are no easier. Filling sheds with carbon dioxide gas is one method, said Kim Sturla, director of welfare organisation Animal Place. Another cull method, she said, is to smother hens with water-based foam, similar to firefighting foam. Water-based foaming is categorised as the “preferred” method by the AVMA. Previously asked about water-based foaming and other cull methods such VSD, an AVMA spokesperson said depopulation decisions were difficult and “and contingent upon several factors, such as the species and number of animals involved, available means of animal restraint, safety of personnel, and other considerations such as availability of equipment, agents and personnel”. European campaigners said firefighting foam causes prolonged suffering. Although risks of similar livestock culls appear low in Europe so far, welfare group, Compassion in World Farming advised using foam that contains nitrogen gas because death is faster.A 2019 European Food Safety Authority journal report said it did not find water-based or firefighting foam acceptable because “death due to drowning in fluids or suffocation by occlusion of the airways” is not seen as “a humane method for killing animals, including poultry”."
"Earlier this month, for the first time in recent memory, pronghorns ventured into the sun-scorched lowlands of Death Valley national park. Undeterred by temperatures that climbed to over 110F, the animals were observed by park staff browsing on a hillside not far from Furnace Creek visitor center. “This is something we haven’t seen in our lifetimes,” said Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for the National Parks Conservation Association. “We’ve known they’re in some of the higher elevation areas of Death Valley but as far as we’re aware they’ve never been documented this low in the park, near park headquarters.” The return of pronghorns to Death Valley is but one of many stories of wildlife thriving on public lands since the coronavirus closures went into effect a month and a half ago. In Yosemite national park, closed since 20 March, wildlife have flocked in large numbers to a virtually abandoned Yosemite Valley. More than 4 million visitors traveled to Yosemite last year, the vast majority by way of automobile. On busy late-spring days, as visitors gather to see the famed Yosemite, Vernal and Bridal Veil Falls, the 7.5-mile long valley can become an endless procession of cars. But traffic jams seem a distant memory as the closure approaches its two-month mark. Deer, bobcats and black bears have congregated around buildings, along roadways and other parts of the park typically teeming with visitors. One coyote, photographed by park staff lounging in an empty parking lot under a rushing Yosemite Falls, seemed to best capture the momentary state of repose. A handful of workers who have remained in Yosemite during the closures, who have been able to travel by foot and bike along the deserted roadways, describe an abundance of wildlife not seen in the last century. “The bear population has quadrupled,” Dane Peterson, a worker at the Ahwahnee Hotel, told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s not like they usually aren’t here … It’s that they usually hang back at the edges or move in the shadows.” Similar behaviors have been documented in other national parks including Rocky Mountain, in Colorado, and Yellowstone, in Wyoming. “Without an abundance of visitors and vehicles, wildlife has been seen in areas they typically don’t frequent,” said the National Park Service spokesperson Cynthia Hernandez, “including near roadways, park buildings and parking lots, spending time doing what they usually do naturally: foraging for food”. The human-free interregnum is rapidly coming to an end, however, as the park service ramps up its phased reopening. While Yosemite, Death Valley and a number of other California national parks remain closed, on Monday, Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks – which collectively received nearly 8 million visitors in 2019 – reopened their gates for the first time since late March. To protect visitors and staff, the park service has hired seasonal workers to disinfect high use areas and installed plastic barriers at tollbooths, visitor centers and permit desks. But few if any protective measures have been put in place for wildlife. The consequences of the re-openings may be especially hard on young animals born in the calm of the closures, according to wildlife experts. “Individuals who have lived in the national park area will likely readjust pretty quickly to the return of recreators after quarantine,” said Lindsay Rosa, a conservation scientist with Defenders of Wildlife. “But newcomers, particularly juveniles born this spring, may take a bit longer to learn since they haven’t yet had the opportunity to encounter many humans.” Visitors to the re-opened parks should be particularly wary of amphibians, says Rosa, many of which are beginning their migration to breeding grounds. “[For them], roads remain a particularly fatal obstacle.”"
"Denis Summers-Smith, who has died aged 99, belonged to the pioneering pre-second world war generation of birdwatchers whose contributions to our understanding of bird behaviour helped transform the science of ornithology. In particular Summers-Smith wrote about, and made a lifelong study of, the house sparrow, a bird he chose partly because it was so abundant. Yet towards the end of the 20th century house sparrow numbers suddenly began to plummet, in urban and rural settings alike. Several theories were proposed to explain the decline, and in 2000 the Independent newspaper offered a prize of £5,000 for the first peer-reviewed scientific paper to find a solution, with Summers-Smith acting as referee. Eight years later, the prize was finally awarded to scientists at De Montfort University, Leicester, who ascribed the decline to a fall in numbers of insects, on which sparrows feed their chicks during their first few days of life. The reason this affected sparrows more than other songbird species was connected with their sedentary nature – rarely travelling more than a mile from their birthplace in their brief lives. In his first book, a Collins New Naturalist monograph entitled The House Sparrow (1963), Summers-Smith had confidently predicted that the species would enjoy a bright future. After all, no other bird had adapted quite so well to living alongside humanity, having spread – with our help – to six of the world’s seven continents. Despite experiencing an unprecedented fall in its numbers, in the final years of his life the species at last showed signs of recovery. Born in Glasgow, Denis was the son of Thomas, a lawyer, who died when he was just three years old, and his wife, Eleanor (nee Robinson). She brought Denis and his older brother, Robert, up in a strict Presbyterian household. On childhood holidays in County Donegal in Ireland, his uncle – a country parson and naturalist – ignited Denis’s passion for birds. Educated at Glasgow Academy, Summers-Smith earned a scholarship to Glasgow University, where in 1937 he began studying metallurgy. In 1939, at the outbreak of the second world war, his university course came to an abrupt halt when he enlisted as an intelligence officer in the army. Commissioned in 1940, he rose to the rank of captain, serving with the ninth battalion of the Cameronians regiment on the east coast of England. Despite his duties, he managed to find occasional moments for birdwatching – notably when surveying likely spots for a German invasion on the Suffolk coast. In June 1944 he was involved in the second wave of the D-day landings in Normandy, for which, 75 years later in 2019, he was appointed Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur. While serving in France he was badly injured, spending 18 months in hospital; once discharged, he married his fiancee, Margaret (nee Mau) in 1947.  Following the end of hostilities, Summers-Smith began work at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) as a mechanical engineer. Like many people whose education had been interrupted by the war, he resumed his studies, gaining degrees in engineering and, in 1953, a PhD in physics. He specialised in tribology: the study of friction, wear and lubrication. However, his passion for birdwatching remained, and in 1948 he had decided to make an intensive study of a single species of bird. With petrol rationing still in force he was unable to travel far, so the house sparrow’s abundance and proximity to people was ideal. Having risen early to study the birds before he started work, he was twice reported to the police by neighbours, who wondered why a suspicious character was peering through binoculars into their gardens. After his son, Mike, was born in 1949, the family moved from Hampshire to County Durham; then, in 1961, to Guisborough in North Yorkshire, where he remained for the rest of his life. Two years later he published his first book, and during the next few decades he took advantage of the opportunities for global travel afforded by his job to study the entire sparrow family. His studies were published in several books: The Sparrows (1988), The Tree Sparrow (1995) and a memoir, In Search of Sparrows, published in 1992. His writings revealed a fascination not just with the behaviour of the house sparrow, but with its social and cultural history too. Biblical references were cited, there was a fascinating account of the “sparrow clubs” of early 20th century Britain, which organised culls of a bird considered an agricultural pest, and, more recently, details of an incident in the Netherlands in which a rogue sparrow ruined a world record attempt at the “domino effect” by inadvertently collapsing thousands of dominoes. His book On Sparrows and Man: A Love-Hate Relationship was published in 2006. He also penned numerous scientific papers, and served on the committees of organisations such as the British Ornithologists’ Union and the British Trust for Ornithology. His honours included the Stamford Raffles award, given for distinguished contributions to zoology, which he received from the Zoological Society of London in 1992. In his public and private life he was, like the subject of his studies, a friendly, unassuming and humble man, always willing to share his knowledge with others. After Margaret’s sudden death in 1972 he married another Margaret (nee Rebbeck), who died in 2004. He is survived by Mike."
"Whether you are concerned about your health, the environment or animal welfare, scientific evidence is piling up that meat-free diets are best. Millions of people in wealthy nations are already cutting back on animal products. Of course livestock farmers and meat lovers are unsurprisingly fighting back and it can get confusing. Are avocados really worse than beef? What about bee-massacring almond production? The coronavirus pandemic has added another ingredient to that mix. The rampant destruction of the natural world is seen as the root cause of diseases leaping into humans and is largely driven by farming expansion. The world’s top biodiversity scientists say even more deadly pandemics will follow unless the ecological devastation is rapidly halted. Food is also a vital part of our culture, while the affordability of food is an issue of social justice. So there isn’t a single perfect diet. But the evidence is clear: whichever healthy and sustainable diet you choose, it is going to have much less red meat and dairy than today’s standard western diets, and quite possibly none. That’s for two basic reasons. First, the over-consumption of meat is causing an epidemic of disease, with about $285bn spent every year around the world treating illness caused by eating red meat alone. Second, eating plants is simply a far more efficient use of the planet’s stretched resources than feeding the plants to animals and then eating them. The global livestock herd and the grain it consumes takes up 83% of global farmland, but produces just 18% of food calories. So what about all those arguments in favour of meat-eating and against vegan diets? Let’s start with the big beef about red meat. This is true only when compared to intensively-reared beef linked to forest destruction. The UK’s National Farmers Union says UK beef has only half the emissions compared to the world average. But a lot of research shows grass-fed beef uses more land and produces more – or at best similar – emissions because grain is easier for cows to digest and intensively reared cows live shorter lives. Both factors mean less methane. Either way, the emissions from even the best beef are still many times that from beans and pulses. There’s more. If all the world’s pasture lands were returned to natural vegetation, it would remove greenhouse gases equivalent to about 8 bn tonnes of carbon dioxide per year from the atmosphere, according to Joseph Poore at Oxford University. That’s about 15% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Only a small fraction of that pasture land would be needed to grow food crops to replace the lost beef. So overall, if tackling the climate crisis is your thing, then beef is not. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas and ruminants produce a lot of it. But it only remains in the atmosphere for a relatively short time: half is broken down in nine years. This leads some to argue that maintaining the global cattle herd at current levels – about 1 billion animals – is not heating the planet. The burping cows are just replacing the methane that breaks down as time goes by. But this is simply “creative accounting”, according to Pete Smith at the University of Aberdeen and Andrew Balmford at the University of Cambridge. We shouldn’t argue that cattle farmers can continue to pollute just because they have done so in the past, they say: “We need to do more than just stand still.” In fact, the short-lived nature of methane actually makes reducing livestock numbers a “particularly attractive target”, given that we desperately need to cut greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. In any case, just focusing on methane doesn’t make the rampant deforestation by cattle ranchers in South America go away. Even if you ignore methane completely, says Poore, animal products still produce more CO2 than plants. Even one proponent of the methane claim says: “I agree that intensive livestock farming is unsustainable.” NFU president, Minette Batters, says: “Sixty-five percent of British land is only suitable for grazing livestock and we have the right climate to produce high-quality red meat and dairy.” “But if everybody were to make the argument that ‘our pastures are the best and should be used for grazing’, then there would be no way to limit global warming,” says Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford. His work shows that a transition to a predominantly plant-based flexitarian diet would free up both pasture and cropland. The pasture could instead be used to grow trees and lock up carbon, provide land for rewilding and the restoration of nature, and growing bio-energy crops to displace fossil fuels. The crops no longer being fed to animals could instead become food for people, increasing a nation’s self-sufficiency in grains. This is true. The problem is that even in the very best cases, this carbon storage offsets only 20%-60% of the total emissions from grazing cattle. “In other words, grazing livestock – even in a best-case scenario – are net contributors to the climate problem, as are all livestock,” says Tara Garnett, also at the University of Oxford. Furthermore, research shows this carbon storage reaches its limit in a few decades, while the problem of methane emissions continue. The stored carbon is also vulnerable - a change in land use or even a drought can see it released again. Proponents of “holistic grazing” to trap carbon are also criticised for unrealistic extrapolation of local results to global levels. That is probably true but misses the real point. A huge driver of the global wildlife crisis is the past and continuing destruction of natural habitat to create pasture for livestock. Herbivores do have an important role in ecosystems, but the high density of farmed herds means pasture is worse for wildlife than natural land. Eating less meat means less destruction of wild places and cutting meat significantly would also free up pasture and cropland that could be returned to nature. Furthermore, a third of all cropland is used to grow animal feed. There is no lack of protein, despite the claims. In rich nations, people commonly eat 30-50% more protein than they need. All protein needs can easily be met from plant-based sources, such as beans, lentils, nuts and whole grains. But animals can play a role in some parts of Africa and Asia where, in India for example, waste from grain production can feed cattle that produce milk. In the rest of the world, where much of cropland that could be used to feed people is actually used to feed animals, a cut in meat eating is still needed for agriculture to be sustainable. It’s not. Well over 96% of soy from the Amazon region is fed to cows, pigs and chickens eaten around the world, according to data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, says Poore. Furthermore, 97% of Brazilian soy is genetically modified, which is banned for human consumption in many countries and is rarely used to make tofu and soya milk in any case. Soya milk also has much smaller emissions and land and water use than cow’s milk. If you are worried about the Amazon, not eating meat remains your best bet. Some almond production may well cause environmental problems. But that is because rising demand has driven rapid intensification in specific places, like California, which could be addressed with proper regulation. It is nothing to do with what almonds need to grow. Traditional almond production in Southern Europe uses no irrigation at all. It is also perhaps worth noting that the bees that die in California are not wild, but raised by farmers like six-legged livestock. Like soya milk, almond milk still has lower carbon emissions and land and water use than cow’s milk. But if you are still worried, there are plenty of alternatives, with oat milk usually coming out with the lowest environmental footprint. Again, the problem here is the rapid growth of production in specific regions that lack prudent controls on water use, like Peru and Chile. Avocados generate a third of the emissions of chicken, a quarter of those of pork, and a 20th of beef. If you are still worried about avocados, you can of course choose not to eat them. But it’s not a reason to eat meat instead, which has a much bigger water and deforestation footprint. The market is likely to solve the problem, as the high demand from consumers for avocados and almonds incentivises farmers elsewhere to grow the crops, thereby alleviating the pressure on current production hotspots. Quinoa is an amazing food and has seen a boom. But the idea that this took food from the mouths of poor farmers is wrong. “The claim that rising quinoa prices were hurting those who had traditionally produced and consumed it is patently false,” said researchers who studied the issue. Quinoa was never a staple food, representing just a few percent of the food budget for these people. The quinoa boom has had no effect on their nutrition. The boom also significantly boosted the farmers’ income. There is an issue with falling soil quality, as the land is worked harder. But quinoa is now planted in China, India and Nepal, as well as in the US and Canada, easing the burden. The researchers are more worried now about the loss of income for South American farmers as the quinoa supply rises and the price falls. Palm oil plantations have indeed led to terrible deforestation. But that is an issue for everybody, not only vegans: it’s in about half of all products on supermarket shelves, both food and toiletries. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature argues that choosing sustainably produced palm oil is actually positive, because other oil crops take up more land. But Poore says: “We are abandoning millions of acres a year of oilseed land around the world, including rapeseed and sunflower fields in the former Soviet regions, and traditional olive plantations.” Making better use of this land would be preferable to using palm oil, he says. A vegan diet is generally very healthy, but doctors have warned about the potential lack of B12, an important vitamin for brain function that is found in meat, eggs and cows’ milk. This is easily remedied by taking a supplement. However, a closer look reveals some surprises. B12 is made by bacteria in soil and the guts of animals, and free-range livestock ingest the B12 as they graze and peck the ground. But most livestock are not free-range, and pesticides and antibiotics widely used on farms kill the B12-producing bugs. The result is that most B12 supplements - 90% according to one source – are fed to livestock, not people. So there’s a choice here between taking a B12 supplement yourself, or eating an animal that has been given the supplement. Algae are a plant-based source of B12, although the degree of bio-availability is not settled yet. It is also worth noting that a significant number of non-vegans are B12 deficient, especially older people. Among vegans the figure is only about 10%. The rapid rise of the plant-based burger has prompted some to criticise them as ultra-processed junk food. A plant-based burger could be unhealthier if the salt levels are very high, says Springmann, but it is most likely to still be healthier than a meat burger when all nutritional factors are considered, particularly fibre. Furthermore, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based alternative is certain to be less damaging to the environment. There is certainly a strong argument to be made that overall we eat far too much processed food, but that applies just as much to meat eaters as to vegetarians and vegans. And given that most people are unlikely to give up their burgers and sausages any time, the plant-based options are a useful alternative. Most vegans would say it’s just silly to say fruit and veg are animal products and plenty are produced without animal dung. In any case there is no reason for horticulture to rely on manure at all. Synthetic fertiliser is easily made from the nitrogen in the air and there is plenty of organic fertiliser available if we chose to use it more widely in the form of human faeces. Over application of fertiliser does cause water pollution problems in many parts of the world. But that applies to both synthetic fertiliser and manure and results from bad management. Piers Morgan is among those railing against “hypocrite” vegans because commercially kept bees die while pollinating almonds and avocados and combine harvesters “create mass murder of bugs” and small mammals while bringing in the grain harvest. But almost everyone eats these foods, not just vegans. It is true that insects are in a terrible decline across the planet. But the biggest drivers of this are the destruction of wild habitat, largely for meat production, and widespread pesticide use. If it is insects that you are really worried about, then eating a plant-based organic diet is the option to choose. A “planetary health diet” published by scientists to meet both global health and environmental needs was criticised by journalist Joanna Blythman: “When ideologues living in affluent countries pressurise poor countries to eschew animal foods and go plant-based, they are displaying crass insensitivity, and a colonial White Saviour mindset.” In fact, says Springmann, who was part of the team behind the planetary health diet, it would improve nutritional intake in all regions, including poorer regions where starchy foods currently dominate diets. The big cuts in meat and dairy are needed in rich nations. In other parts of the world, many healthy, traditional diets are already low in animal products. “‘Eating local’ is a recommendation you hear often [but] is one of the most misguided pieces of advice,” says Hannah Ritchie, at the University of Oxford. “Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation make up a very small amount of the emissions from food and what you eat is far more important than where your food traveled from.” Beef and lamb have many times the carbon footprint of most other foods, she says. So whether the meat is produced locally or shipped from the other side of the world, plants will still have much lower carbon footprints. Transport emissions for beef are about 0.5% of the total and for lamb it’s 2%. The reason for this is that almost all food transported long distances is carried by ships, which can accommodate huge loads and are therefore fairly efficient. For example, the shipping emissions for avocados crossing the Atlantic are about 8% of their total footprint. Air freight does of course result in high emissions, but very little food is transported this way; it accounts for just 0.16% of food miles. Livestock farming is massively subsidised with taxpayers money around the world – unlike vegetables and fruit. That money could be used to support more sustainable foods such as beans and nuts instead, and to pay for other valuable services, such as capturing carbon in woodlands and wetlands, restoring wildlife, cleaning water and reducing flood risks. Shouldn’t your taxes be used to provide public goods rather than harms? So, food is complicated. But however much we might wish to continue farming and eating as we do today, the evidence is crystal clear that consuming less meat and more plants is very good for both our health and the planet. The fact that some plant crops have problems is not a reason to eat meat instead. In the end, you will choose what you eat. If you want to eat healthily and sustainably, you don’t have to stop eating meat and dairy altogether. The planetary health diet allows for a beef burger, some fish and an egg each week, and a glass of milk or some cheese each day. Food writer Michael Pollan foreshadowed the planetary health diet in 2008 with a simple seven-word rule: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” But if you want to have the maximum impact on fighting the climate and wildlife crisis, then it is going to be all plants."
"France is to outlaw trapping birds using sticks covered in glue after the European commission threatened legal action and fines. The move was welcomed by campaigners who have described the practice as “barbaric” and who urged the French government not to bow to pressure from the powerful hunting lobby. Hunters argue the method of trapping the birds, known as chasse à la glu, is a centuries-old rural tradition and say they are being persecuted. Using glue sticks to catch birds has been outlawed in Europe since the 1979 Bird Directive, except in specific circumstances where the practice is “controlled, selective and in limited quantities”. Since 1989, France has invoked these circumstances to permit glue-trapping in five south-east departments on the grounds that it is “traditional”. The French Bird Protection League (LPO) produced evidence from hidden cameras to prove that the practice is not selective and poses a threat to endangered species, which persuaded the European commission to act. France, one of the last European countries to authorise hunting birds with glue, has been given until October to definitively outlaw the practice. At a meeting with hunters last week Barbara Pompili, the newly appointed minister for ecological transition, told them the chasse à la glu must end by October. “This is a final warning from the European commission. France cannot be the last country that allows the trapping and barbaric torture of birds. This hunting is non selective and cruel,” said Yves Verilhac, the director of the LPO. “The hunting lobby is blaming the new minister because she’s a woman and an ecologist, but all she is doing is not signing any opt-outs to the directive this year under threat from the European commission.” The LPO estimates 40,000 birds are caught using glue sticks by 5,000 hunters every year. The hunters are allowed to catch four types of thrush and one of blackbird, but secretly filmed video shown to the Guardian last year showed robins, blue tits, warblers and finches struggling and dying on glue-sticks or being pulled off and discarded like litter. Last year, LPO activists found a dead kestrel, its wings gummed with glue. Willy Schraen, the president of the Hunting Federation, said he was in “complete disagreement” with the government’s decision to follow the directive and warned hunters would take legal action. “I hope the minister will not listen to the sirens in Brussels and will remain true to what France, with its traditions and strong values, represents. This is a very ancient way of capturing birds,” Schraen told FranceInfo. He added: “I don’t think it’s barbaric. I don’t think those who practise this chasse à la glu are thugs. They are people with strong values who are happy to catch a few birds. Why is this a problem? The real question is … why is the head of environment in Europe wasting time persecuting a few Gaulois?” “We will legally defend glue-trapping because it is a symbol [of our culture].” Verilhac has urged the government not to give in. “If they do, the French people will find themselves paying millions in fines for the sake of 5,000 hunters,” he said. “The hunters paint this idyllic picture of country folk living off the land with their traditions, but these hunters aren’t rural people. Most of them turn up in expensive 4x4 vehicles from the city.” Verilhac added: “Besides, not all traditions should be defended. Hunting with glue sticks is an abomination.”"
"The Alhambra, which sits on a hill in Granada, Andalucía, is the only preserved palatine city of the Islamic period and a Unesco world heritage site. Once the residence of the Nasrid sultans, it is one of the most visited national monuments in the world.  The Moorish architecture from the 13th century is peppered with pools, fountains and waterways that ensure an abundance of water and lush vegetation and a rich diversity of wildlife, including a wide range of aquatic species, especially amphibians. There is evidence that the palace and the Generalife gardens have been home to numerous newts and frogs for hundreds of years. Five amphibian species inhabit the Alhambra: the spiny common toad (Bufo spinosus) and the Iberian green frog (Pelophylax perezi – also know as Perez’s frog) are the most common and are easily spotted. The Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), the Betic midwife toad (Alytes dickhilleni) and the Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi) are less widespread. The Iberian ribbed newt was once abundant in the Alhambra and is again thriving after being reintroduced. Hundreds of larvae have been rescued from drying ponds in other areas not far from Granada and released into the pools.  The ribbed newt is perhaps the most notable of the Alhambra’s amphibian population, as it maintains its tail into adulthood, giving it a lizard-like appearance. After several releases, the newts now reproduce in their new home and have established a healthy population – though visitors may need to look closely to spot them.

"The whiskery leaves of the nettles, the out-of-hand brambles, the stale summer green of the crowding hawthorn, the new branches of the young beech and linden trees – they all look as though someone has been careless with a bucket of whitewash. The reason isn’t hard to figure out. As I stand here at the edge of the woods, knee-deep in the understorey, a male blackbird up above adds another damp ovoid daub to the monochrome Jackson Pollock effect. What goes in must come out. Cherry season has begun, and I’m in birdshit central. The poo of hungry birds is vitally important to the propagation of the wild cherry tree (its scientific name, Prunus avium, acknowledges as much). A German study in 2007 found that 17 species were involved in the distribution of the tree’s seeds – each cleverly smuggled within an eye-catching gobbet of sweet pulp. Blackbirds, song and mistle thrushes, jays, woodpeckers and wood pigeons, among others, were joined by migrants on a calorie-loading mission: blackcaps, whitethroats and garden warblers. There are two wood pigeons feeding in the canopy now. Earlier, as I climbed up from the ponds, I saw a roe deer charging through the brambles and high thistles up ahead. I’m sure it made less noise than the pigeons are making as they lumber and pitch from branch to branch. I’m pretty sure you could put the roe deer 30 feet up in a cherry tree and it would make less noise. But of course the birds are indifferent to trivial notions of grace – these cherries are a time-limited bonanza. I pick my way down a trail through the trees. It’s mostly songless: the embarrassed silence of the summer moult. Heaton Woods is an old reach of woodland within walking distance of central Bradford – the kind of place where people say: “This? Here?” The population of Heaton is about 50% Pakistani or British Pakistani, and most of the people in the woods today – running, walking together, pottering about like me – appear to be from an Asian background. Now that access to nature for non-white communities is a mainstream talking point, places like this – where there are cherry trees full of birds right in an old mill city’s immigrant heartland – feel particularly important."
"Populations of migratory river fish around the world have plunged by a “catastrophic” 76% since 1970, an analysis has found. The fall was even greater in Europe at 93%, and for some groups of fish, with sturgeon and eel populations both down by more than 90%. Species such as salmon, trout and giant catfish are vital not just to the rivers and lakes in which they breed or feed but to entire ecosystems. By swimming upstream, they transport nutrients from the oceans and provide food for many land animals, including bears, wolves and birds of prey. The migratory fish are also critical for the food security and livelihoods of millions of people around the world, while recreational fishing is worth billions of dollars a year. The causes of the decline are the hundreds of thousands of dams around the world, overfishing, the climate crisis and water pollution. The scientists said the situation may be even bleaker than it seemed, as many declines began before 1970. Populations of sturgeon in the Great Lakes of North America, for example, have dropped by 95% from historic levels. Furthermore, suitable data has not been gathered on species in some of the world’s most biodiverse rivers such as the Mekong, Congo, Amazon and Yangtze, where researchers fear there will be hundreds of fish extinctions in the coming decades. The average fall in populations was 84% in Latin America, while there has been a 59% decrease in Asia-Oceania, although there is limited data there and not enough from Africa to determine any reliable trend. In North America, the fall was less dramatic, at 28%. This is probably because large declines occurred before 1970, but also as a result of a growing number of dams being removed. “For migratory fish, there’s nothing worse than a dam,” said Zeb Hogan, at the University of Nevada and an author of the new report. He said the good news was that fish could return quickly: “Almost without exception, where dams have been removed, you see populations bounce back, often much more quickly than anyone anticipated.” A river restoration completed by the Penobscot River Restoration Trust partners in 2016 on the Penobscot River in Maine, US, led to river herring numbers growing from a few hundred to nearly 2m a year. The Dam Removal Europe coalition is working to free the continent’s rivers from more than 100,000 obsolete barriers. But thousands of hydropower dams are being built in other parts of the world. “Catastrophic losses in migratory fish populations show we cannot continue destroying our rivers,” said Arjan Berkhuysen, at the World Fish Migration Foundation. “This has immense consequences for people and nature across the globe. We can and need to act now before these keystone species are lost for good.” Michelle Jackson, at the University of Oxford, UK, who was not involved in the report, said: “The population declines are certainly very drastic, but I am not surprised. The outlook gets worse each time [there is a new report].” She said migratory fish were often the driving force in food chains because they transport nutrients: “If these fish populations continue to decline, there will be far-reaching consequences for many species which rely on them.” The decline in migratory fish populations is higher than that for land and ocean animals, whose populations have fallen by an average of 60% in the last 50 years. “Freshwaters are disproportionately at risk to human pressures, since they are affected by everything happening in the surrounding catchment,” said Jackson. Previous research by Hogan found many giant river fish are on the verge of extinction, with populations from catfish to stingrays down by 97% since 1970. Other studies have shown only a third of world’s great rivers remain free-flowing, while in Britain, for example, 97% of the river network has been interrupted by human-built structures. The report, led by Stefanie Deinet at the Zoological Society of London, examined data from 1,406 populations of 247 species. There are 1,100 species that must migrate to survive. The researchers said much more data was needed for regions outside Europe and North America to go beyond the general trends presented in the report. The analysis did show management plans for rivers and fishing helped curb the losses, with populations down 54% in such circumstances, compared with 87% for those that were unmanaged. Migratory fish often use water temperature as a cue to start their journeys, but dams can significantly lower the temperature of river water. Global heating is also a factor, and can also change rainfall patterns. “So you get these very unnatural flows that can really have an impact on migratory fish,” said Hogan. “Not all dams are created equal,” he added. “Some dams are more environmentally damaging than others and how you place, design and operate them is important.” The damage to ecosystems and livelihoods must be taken more into account when building new dams, he said. Stephanie Januchowski-Hartley, at Swansea University, UK, said the millions of small obstructions to rivers, such as road culverts, also needed to be considered: “The cumulative effects of those are potentially greater than that of larger infrastructure, because of sheer numbers in the waterscape.” “We know why we’re losing these fish and we know what to do to save or restore them,” Hogan said. “It’s now a matter of public awareness and public will.” Stuart Orr, at WWF, said: “The world needs to implement an emergency recovery plan for the benefit of people and nature.”"
"If I thought food waste was complicated before Covid-19 emerged, now it blows my mind. I started to research a version of this article in January – those carefree days when people worried about supermarkets overstocking, not the disappearance of pasta and flour. Even then, the picture was hazy, but it was much clearer than it is now. Until lockdown, most of us were accustomed to any-time, any-place food shopping. Remember when you could eat in all sorts of places? Food was available everywhere, for those with means – and we ate everywhere, too: leaning against a wall with a box of slow-cooked pork from a street-food market; sharing popcorn at the cinema or chips at the pub. They say you’re never more than 6ft from a rat in Britain’s towns and cities, but we were also never much farther from a snack. Then, in an instant, it was gone.  Nationally, we shopped for far more food than we needed: pre-lockdown data showed that 50-70% of all the food wasted in the UK came from our own kitchens – 6.6m tonnes, worth £500 per household each year. The figures were absurd: 800,000 apples and 4.4m potatoes thrown in the bin every day; a sixth of all the milk we bought went down the sink. Not now. With queues to get in, masks and that slow-motion trolley dance we all do to keep the mandated distance, the supermarket is no longer such a tempting place. Confronted with the obvious – that food is finite – we now regard it as a much more precious commodity. Recent research by Hubbub, a UK sustainability charity, says 57% of us value food more than we did pre-coronavirus. My kids, husband and I fell ill a week before lockdown. In total, we did four weeks in isolation, just as the shelves were emptying. We never went without (thanks to our beloved neighbours) but if you don’t know when you’ll be able to get more yoghurt, you eat all the yoghurt you have. Now, we shop as infrequently as possible, doing big, fortnightly shops as well as ordering from local butchers and greengrocers, mirroring shopping patterns more like my mum’s, nearly 40 years ago. (Much of my current life mimics my childhood: I don’t recall eating a ready-made sandwich until my late teens, meals out were for birthdays and the family ate together.) Most of us shop less often now and use more of what we buy: new data from Wrap, a charity that aims to reduce waste, shows a 34% reduction in wasted potatoes, bread, chicken and milk at home; it also shows that people are actively trying to waste less – making meals with what they have, batching, using leftovers, planning menus before shopping. Many family meals are now driven by what we need to use up: wrinkled peppers roasted or grilled, the potatoes my children reject at night mixed with mayo and chives next day. It’s too soon to know if we’re actually throwing less in the bin, as those numbers are arrived at more slowly, from measuring waste in individual households and via council collections. So I decided to run my own, admittedly small-scale, survey. I recruited 20 or so households from all over the UK and asked them to weigh their total food waste (edible and inedible). Before coronavirus, national statistics showed we ate less at home (16.8 meals a week, on average), but threw out about 1.9kg of food waste per person every week – of which more than 60% is thought to be avoidable. According to the results of my mini survey, although we cook and eat almost all 21 weekly meals at home now, we chuck out an average of 1.57kg a week – a significant reduction. Exactly what goes into the bin remains a mystery – every respondent was at pains to tell me it was almost all bones, shells, peelings and coffee grounds. But if this anecdotal reduction in waste applies more widely, it would represent a more rapid shift in behaviour than anything achieved by more than 10 years of national food waste campaigns. It’s wild extrapolation, but if my findings were replicated countrywide, it would mean the household food wasted annually could be as little as 4.36m tonnes – 2.3m tonnes less than last year. The UK has committed to halving food waste by 2030 – has coronavirus made that a possibility? Globally, food waste accounts for about 8% of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is almost equivalent to road transport; if food waste was a country, its emissions would be beaten only by the US and China. “Household waste is half the problem,” Tessa Clarke, who founded Olio, a neighbour-to-neighbour food-sharing app, tells me. “But if you flip that on its head, we can be half the solution. That’s an empowering message: here’s something really simple you could do, starting right now, in your home.” Clarke co-founded Olio after trying and failing to give away unwanted food before a house move. “Whenever people think about food waste, they think about businesses. That could not be more wrong,” she says. She is frustrated that much of the attention – media and government – in recent years has been on food waste from supermarkets and the grocery sector. “All the focus has gone on 2% of the problem. We have not been looking at the home and at the other end, the 20-30% at the farm gate.” Two per cent is still a lot of food, though: at least 300,000 tonnes in retail and wholesale, perhaps more, as most data collected is given voluntarily. Supermarkets and their suppliers divert some unsold food that is about to go out of date, or food that can’t be sold (damaged cereal boxes, squashed blocks of cheese, chocolate Santas in January). They work with charities such as FareShare, which has been redistributing surplus since 1994, and FoodCloud, launched in 2013, which lets shops alert food banks, hostels or breakfast clubs that collect unsold or surplus food. Even so, only about 6% of supermarket surplus – 17,500 tonnes a year – was, prior to the coronavirus outbreak, redistributed to people. (A further 23,000 tonnes was gleaned from manufacturing by companies such as Rejuce, which makes juice; Rubies in the Rubble, which make sauces and chutneys; and Toast Ale, which turns some of the 24m slices of bread thrown away daily into beer.) When the hospitality industry shut down, many people assumed farmers and producers could simply sell their food through shops. But hyper-efficient, inflexible supermarket systems are not built to absorb excess food from elsewhere. And if you usually produce 30cm square catering packs of sticky toffee pudding, it is very hard to change all the packaging, let alone set that pudding in front of a retail buyer. While some companies have switched to supplying local shops, or delivery or takeaway, other producers have found themselves hemmed in by differing standards. Chefs, for example, often care much less about the cosmetic appearance or specific weight of fruit and vegetables than retailers, who require a degree of uniformity. Other produce just can’t be sold in other ways: most fish and chip shops closed during lockdown; now, social distancing means they are serving fewer people. Combined with restaurant closures, this left the UK with about 95,000 tonnes of chipping potatoes in growers’ stores at the end of June, just as the 2020 crop was ready for harvest. Growers will store them as long as possible, but some will end up as animal feed or being sent to anaerobic digestion, to be turned into energy. We don’t know how much produce is wasted on farms, whether due to wonkiness, gluts or supermarket orders changed at the last minute: Wrap, the waste prevention charity, estimated last year that 3.6m tonnes of edible food is lost on British farms. There is clearly enough – and probably too much – food in the system, but it doesn’t always get to where it’s needed. Meanwhile, food redistribution charities have ramped up their output in response to accelerating demand. Fareshare usually delivers enough food to make 1m meals a week through its network of charities, but is now delivering enough for 2m. In the first week of lockdown, the charity saw a short-lived crash in its normal supermarket fresh food surpluses, but was almost overwhelmed by catering industry donations – a 1,500% increase on last April. Now, Fareshare is helping thousands of charities access long-life, non-surplus products to go in food parcels for newly economically vulnerable people. Iain Linsdell is headteacher at Poplar Street Primary in Audenshaw, in the Greater Manchester area, where, even before coronavirus, an estimated 620,000 people were at risk of going hungry. “Without FareShare, there would be hunger and hardship on a scale that we have probably never experienced,” he says. “Instead of families and kids coming to us, we’re going out to them.” Another waste-food redistribution charity, City Harvest, has doubled its usual output, using kitchens loaned by Crystal Palace football club, the Savoy hotel, the Mayfair private members’ club Annabel’s and Wimbledon’s All England Lawn Tennis Club to create 1.4m meals since lockdown, in greater London alone. Chef Lauren Everet cooks at the Soup Kitchen on Tottenham Court Road, which is supplied by City Harvest. “We’ve seen the young, 18-21-year-olds, and many pension-age guests. We’ve seen people who obviously haven’t been sleeping rough very long, and some who look as if they’re on the cusp of homelessness. We had 161 people in recently, which was a new record for us, but we fed them all. There is a small percentage of people who are what we call ‘food poor’: they may afford accommodation, but cannot afford bills, transport and food. We’ve given them a food parcel to take home that lasts a week to 10 days.” The government’s loud support for what these charities do – including £5m extra for redistribution, from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) – raises an awkward question. The government says it’s fighting food waste, but isn’t it just enabling the existing surplus food to be better dealt with, rather than actively reducing it? Could it even be an advantage for the government to have thousands of tonnes of free food sloshing around, available to feed vulnerable people, rather than providing a more generous social safety net? Almost no legislation exists to either force or enable households, farmers or businesses to waste less food, at present. Ben Elliot is the government’s food waste champion, an unpaid advisory role. The philanthropist and luxury concierge company co-founder was appointed in December 2018, to “drive forward the government’s plans to cut food waste” – which must be tricky, given that UK food policy is managed by an extraordinary 16 different government departments. Will there be more legislation in future, I ask him? He tells me he will “push to legislate for real change that will ensure good food does not go unused”, but it’s hard to imagine when that might happen. The possibility of compulsory food waste reporting in the food industry was raised by Elliot in mid-2019 – but the consultations have not been completed. Following on from Elliot’s response to my questions, a Defra spokesman emailed to emphasise the department’s commitment to “addressing the underlying causes of food waste”. Tristram Stuart has been a food waste campaigner for more than a decade and is currently collecting tonnes of 1kg catering packs of everything from hummus to tofu direct from producers, for the food waste charities Feedback and Food for All, which is cooking 5,000 meals a day. But why should on-the-brink hummus suppliers be filling the gap? “Redistribution should never be regarded as the solution to poverty or hunger, and it certainly isn’t a viable solution to food waste,” Stuart says. “At best, redistribution organisations are sticking plasters with big notices on them saying, ‘We need to restructure the food system.’” Fareshare’s big hope is that it is allowed to extend a pilot scheme with government funding, and fast. At the moment, unknowable quantities of farm waste are repurposed as animal feed, composted or sent to anaerobic digestion (for which tax incentives are available – but not for getting the same food to a school breakfast club). A small amount is collected by gleaning charities such as Waste Knot, which sends volunteers to rescue produce from farmers such as Peter Ascroft, who grows beetroot and cauliflower on 400 acres in Lancashire. “We supply beetroot to the catering industry,” he says. “We had a good crop this year. We’ve probably lost 100 tonnes of beetroot [in sales], which to us is significant.” Some of his unusual candied and yellow beetroot was gleaned, but most was simply ploughed back into the soil, representing a heartbreaking return on his work. Chefs love speciality beetroot, but it is of little interest to most supermarkets.  Fareshare’s pilot saved 3,000 tonnes of farm produce, and more money from Defra would let it pay farmers to harvest, process, package and transport surplus crops. “This year looks set to be a once-in-a-generation growing season,” says Lindsay Boswell, chief executive of Fareshare. “Inevitably there will be more surplus. For some, healthy fruit and veg is an unaffordable luxury – funding would help get it on to the plates of vulnerable people.” The lack of migrant labour this year to pick strawberries and cut broccoli may tangle things still further. Defra has set up a website and campaign, Pick For Britain, to recruit British workers, but more than half the jobs available remain unfilled and farmers worry that potential pickers will slowly return to their usual work and won’t want to commit to the length of time needed. As Ascroft says: “Are you going to come and cut cauliflowers all day, in Lancashire, in the rain?” It’s not just veg. From 6 to 20 April, a million litres of milk had to be poured away, says Peter Alvis, chairman of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers. The closure of restaurants and coffee shops meant milk suddenly had nowhere to go. In the following weeks, dairy farmers and processors managed to reroute most of it into shops, or process it as milk powder or fats. “I don’t believe we are currently throwing milk away,” Alvis says. “But farmers have taken a hit by lowering production.” Food waste apps are trying to prevent specialist dairy losses – Too Good To Go is helping the Cornish Cheese Company sell off 10 tonnes of surplus Cornish blue cheese in consumer-friendly 1kg pieces – and Alvis is pushing Defra to help sheep, goat and buffalo milk producers, the people who make goat curd or burrata for chefs. “They are in a much worse position because their markets have disappeared,” he says. “Some are trying to diversify, some are seeing 100% income losses.” Could this lead to mass livestock culls, of the sort already seen in the US? “The government is working to avoid that,” Alvis says. “It depends on what support we can get to them.” Why not just put all the excess in warehouse-sized freezers? “Cold storage in the UK is full,” says Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation industry body. “No one is taking on new business. The peak was in April when we had things backing up like frozen vegetables and meat, especially the expensive cuts that normally go into restaurants. Fast-food restaurants opening up drive-throughs means frozen meat and potatoes will begin to move, but we don’t know what demand will be like because you can’t serve as many people.” Lack of storage is why Mim Skinner is finding high-end, long-life, in-date salami in the surplus donated to her food redistribution charity REfUSE, in Chester-le-Street. Usually, she runs a cafe and catering business using surplus food donated by businesses, and the charity is the regional food redistributor for a big online supermarket. “Our staples are usually milk and bread. Now we are getting high levels of luxury products – manchego, mozzarella and parmesan – and only a few tins of beans. This morning we got 300 pheasant breasts meant for restaurants,” she says. In the last few weeks, Skinner has taken in 8kg of novello olives, 23 wheels of brie and 30kg of charcuterie, much of which would normally have gone to pizza restaurants. Just after Easter she rehomed 2,000 chocolate eggs, some of which were distributed whole, others melted for cooking. There’s no sign of things slowing, either: “We’ve had an email from a restaurant that has gone under, offering the contents of two cold rooms – all the frozen meat, fish, chips and wrap breads.” REfUSE makes 200 hot meals a day for people who can’t afford fuel to cook with or who are living in hostels with few facilities, as well as delivering around 320 food parcels a week. The need is huge, she says. “It’s been really hard to see. We arrive at a house with a delivery and a little kid will run out shouting, ‘Mummy! Food!’” How has the pandemic changed our relationship with food? Christian Reynolds, a lecturer in food policy at City, University of London, has just carried out a study of university students’ eating habits nationwide, and describes the findings as stark. “More than we were expecting had food security issues and, among those, people were eating more ultra-processed foods because they were comfort eating, or that was the only food they could find in the first weeks of lockdown. There were other groups who were cooking brilliantly and reducing food waste.” Does Reynolds think we are on the cusp of a cultural shift? “That’s such a tough one,” he says. “Covid-19 is a massive social disruption. Previous generations have gone through similar things – rationing, for instance, completely changed the British relationship with food, cooking and diet. We each have our own story taking place in our own households, and the end results will very much depend on our situations before and during lockdown.” But for Reynolds, the bigger picture is – just about – hopeful. “We need to halve household waste food waste by 2030. The UK is on that trajectory and there are lots of tools out there to help.” As for the restaurant industry, the future is uncertain. On the one hand, many a Michelin-starred dining room is already set up for social distancing, with tables placed well apart. On the other, might dropping hundreds of pounds on a single meal feel horribly decadent even to those few for whom it’s possible? Even as social distancing rules are relaxed, how many of us will feel ready to brave a dining room? How joyful will a meal out be if we are served by masked and gloved staff? How hard will stocking and staffing restaurants be, as owners navigate uncertain demand? Ordering via an app, once a novelty, will surely become normal (and may help the industry bounce back: apparently we order more when no one’s looking, and are more likely to order things we can’t pronounce). Will we see short, economical menus, or will everyone dive straight back in? Cornwall-based Michelin-starred chef Paul Ainsworth announced he had taken more 3,000 bookings in the two days after the prime minister announced restaurants were set to reopen. But while many aim to open in the next few days, others have chosen to wait; some have said they won’t reopen at all. Tim Siadatan is a chef who co-owns two Italian restaurants, Trullo and Padella, in north London. “I can’t wait to go and sit outside my favourite restaurant and have a long lunch – the moment I can, I’m going,” he says, smiling. “But there will be loads of people who don’t. People will have limited funds and others will be concerned about losing their jobs.” He, too, is hopeful, though. “Supermarkets did an amazing job in the early days, but as lockdown moved on and wholesalers and farmers started to figure out e-commerce, a lot of people realised we don’t need to rely on supermarkets for everything. In the UK we are blessed to be able to get things delivered to the door and that’s gone up tenfold, if not more. And those suppliers have such tight margins that they just don’t waste anything.”  The 4m tonne question is: will these changes stick now the worst of lockdown is over? Will my husband carry on making bread when he’s back at work full time? Will my fridge still be full of tubs of leftover tuna and cheese rinds to melt into sauces? Will we remember the lessons of these strange days, or fall back on old habits at the first opportunity? For me, this has been a profound and, I suspect, life-changing experience. But ask me in a year – when I hope you’ll find me in a crowd, leaning on a wall, eating slow-cooked pork out of a box."
"Parsaloi Kupai’s home, situated on the edge of Ol Kinyei conservancy near the Maasai Mara game reserve, is no different from any other Maasai homestead – oval-shaped huts with an almost flat roof and walls plastered with a mixture of water, mud and cow dung. At the centre of the homestead is a cattle boma, an enclosure where his livestock spends the night, safe from the many predators that roam the area. Kupai, 47, and his two wives chose to live here after they surrendered 69 hectares (170 acres) of land to the 7,500-hectare conservancy. He is among 240 landowners who gave up their highly valued grazing land for the project. “I cannot graze on that land any more,” he tells me, pointing to a hill far into the horizon, the outer reaches of the conservancy. “It is now owned by elephants, wildebeests and lions.” In 2018, Ol Kinyei achieved IUCN Green List status for its good governance, sound design and planning and effective management. Conservancies around Kenya’s world-renowned Maasai Mara national reserve have become a lifeline for vulnerable wild animals that continue to experience a decline in their habitat. According to Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, Kenya has lost 70% of its wildlife in the last 30 years. Researchers spearheaded by the University of Groningen recently pored over 40 years of data that revealed the negative effects of increased human activity along the Mara-Serengeti boundary. The Mara-Serengeti ecosystem straddling Kenya and Tanzania is one of the largest and most protected ecosystems in the world, spanning 40,000 sq km (15,400 sq miles). The researchers found that areas bordering the Mara-Serengeti have experienced a 400% increase in human population over the past decade, while larger wildlife populations in key areas on the Kenyan side were reduced by more than 75%. Michiel Veldhuis, lead author of the study from the University of Groningen, concluded: “There is an urgent need to rethink how we manage the boundaries of protected areas to be able to conserve biodiversity. The future of the world’s most iconic protected area and their associated human population may depend on it.” Communities around the national reserve were driving their livestock further into protected areas. This encroachment, coupled with a lack of clear strategy by the government, has brought wildlife conservation to a crossroads. Dickson Kaelo, head of KWCA, says: “A growing population has seen more land that formerly served as dispersal corridors give way to farming, human settlement and infrastructure development. However, inadequate investment in national parks and lack of a strategy to manage the more than 60% of the country’s wildlife outside protected areas has resulted in a more calamitous loss of wildlife species.” The conservancy model, Kaelo says, is one way to tilt this imbalance, and in the greater Mara region, more than 14,000 landowners have embraced the idea by forming 15 conservancies that offer close to 142,000 hectares of refuge to wild animals. Apart from Ol Kinyei, other conservancies in greater Mara include Naboisho, Olare Motorogi, Lemek, Mara North, and Siana. Landowners in a conservancy identify a tourism operator willing to set up a safari camp within the new block of land. The operator benefits from tailor-made safaris since a conservancy has a higher concentration of wild animals owing to enlarged rangelands. Funds derived from conservation and accommodation fees and philanthropy are shared between the operator and landowners at an agreed percentage. “Conservation pays,” says Daniel Ole Sopia, chief executive officer at the Maasai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association. “Money paid to landowners who have leased their land for wildlife conservation averages $7.5m [£5.9m] annually.” Kupai receives Ksh20,000 (£193) every month for the land he surrendered to Ol Kinyei conservancy, money that he invests in livestock and his children’s education. Critics, however, ask whether setting up community-based conservancies is the best form of land use, as opposed to farming or raising livestock. Some landowners have protested over what they see as skewed agreements between them and tourism operators, with the latter being accused of making huge profits at the expense of landowners. In their defence, conservancy proponents argue that both agriculture and livestock-keeping heavily depend on adequate rainfall, something that is in short supply around the Mara. In addition, they say the soil in the area is too rocky for any meaningful form of farming to take place, and that mechanised farming is too expensive for the many small landholders. “Ideally, a conservancy is a commercial venture and an alternative form of land use to the local Maasai,” says Simon Nkoitoi, the senior warden and manager at Ol Kinyei Conservancy. “The economic benefits derived from this form of wildlife conservation outweigh other commercial ventures, otherwise the local Maasai would not trade their grazing fields for wildlife conservation.” Ol Kinyei was set up in 2005, partly due to the efforts of Jake Grieves-Cook, a veteran of the local tour industry who has worked in sustainable tourism for more than 40 years. His tour operations outfit, Gamewatchers Safaris, operates camps in a number of conservancies in Kenya, including Ol Kinyei. Operators like Gamewatchers must adhere to strict tourism regulations laid out by the group conservancy management. As an example, there can only be a single tent per 700 acres and no more than 12 tents per camp. Low tourism densities in such conservancies mean the few guests have access to thousands of acres, increasing the chances of a memorable wildlife experience. The carbon footprint is kept to a bare minimum. The economic benefits of a conservancy go beyond the land-leasing fees paid out to landowners. In the largely rural settings where conservancies are located, safari camps have created job opportunities for youths who now work as camp managers, drivers and tour guides, housekeepers and chefs. “Look at this camp. All these workers come from the local community and are direct beneficiaries of the conservancy model. The success of the conservancy translates to job security,” Nkoitoi says,sitting on a lawn outside Porini Mara Camp. Herds of elephants and other grazers are in view across a small stream. “They [animals] seem to feel safe in the conservancies. They are less aggressive as there is little human footprint,” says Nkoitoi. Nkoitoi is part of the conservancy management team. His role includes overseeing a team of 19 rangers charged with securing this vast piece of wild Africa. A smartphone app known as Wild (Wildlife Information Landscape Database) assists Nkoitoi and his team in collating wildlife numbers and their location, information that is then transmitted to the conservancy rangers’ post. The application also helps map out possible human-wildlife conflict hotspots. In the greater Mara ecosystem, such conflicts are not in short supply and continue to test the fragile coexistence between local communities and wildlife. Sitting under a giant yellow-backed acacia, Nkoitoi’s phone rings. On the other end is a ranger who informs him of an elephant incursion into a human settlement. “We will check it out in the morning,” he tells the caller. “If we don’t address such issues in time, those people can take matters in their hands,” he says after hanging up. “They can get trampled by the elephants as they try to chase them away.” The following morning, Nkoitoi visits the village, Ereyiet Oltome, located on the eastern edge of Ol Kinyei. Tempers are high following the invasion of elephants. Several homesteads stand a few metres from a thicket where more than a dozen elephants are holed up. The previous day, an elephant had chased a young man who, in a bid to distract his pursuer, threw his traditional wraparound to the ground. “Look! This is what the elephant did to his shuka,” a young man says, holding the tattered cloth belonging to his friend who was too traumatised to venture outdoors. He was fortunate. Some don’t live to relate a close encounter with an elephant. Nkoitoi is soon joined by Marc Goss, head of the rapid response unit at Mara Elephant Project. The villagers are relieved to hear the roar of his helicopter, a sound they have heard before when elephants have invaded their farms. For hours, Goss tries every trick in the book to drive the elephants back to the conservancy. “It is tricky driving elephants out of the private fields,” he says during a break in the operation. “They are clever animals. Mothers will never leave their young behind. Some even go under the helicopter to avoid detection from the air.” By 2pm, a handful have been driven back to the confines of the conservancy. “At least we tried. We did our best,” says Goss. The operation was set to continue next day. Elephant incursions into human settlements are a new phenomenon around Maasai Mara. While the conservancies have increased the land under wildlife conservation, communities on the borderlines have fenced off blocks of land partly to preserve the grass for livestock. Grazing is allowed in some conservancies and outlawed in others. Elephants are attracted by the lush grass within the fenced-off areas. Despite the periodic conflicts between wild animals and humans, there is general agreement that the conservancy model is the way to go in preserving what most of the world has lost. With funding for the conservation model disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has prevented thousands of foreign tourists who would have trooped to the Mara to watch the annual wildebeest migration, a number of emergency fund appeals have been launched. For example, £44,867 has been raised to support local communities and protect endangered wildlife in Mara Naboisho conservancy, while Gamewatchers is urging donors to adopt an acre of land for a year with a donation to the Wildlife Habitat Trust, a fund set up to help to pay the wages of staff working in the conservancies as well as the land leases. The Kenyan government has also announced it is setting aside 2bn Kenyan shillings (£15m) in the coming financial year (starting July 1) to support wildlife conservancies.  “We have hope that wildlife will flourish,” says Kaelo of the conservancy model. “This will happen if investment in our national parks and reserves is quadrupled and private landowners and local communities are effectively incentivised to ensure wildlife is perceived as a national asset.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"Treasure hunters have reacted with shock, delight and disbelief to the news that a chest containing gems, gold and antiques worth up to $2m has reportedly been found in the Rocky Mountains. “I’ve had every emotion under the sun,” said Sacha Dent of Kansas, who dedicated years to a quest that resulted in the deaths of up to five people. “First it was shock and sadness, then on Monday a mix of happiness, relief and excitement,” said Dent. “I’ve invested six years into this. Now it’s finally over. I am very happy for the person who found it.” An eccentric New Mexico millionaire named Forrest Fenn said he hid the bronze chest in the Rockies in 2010. The only clues to the prize’s whereabouts were located in a cryptic 24-line poem written by Fenn and added to the last pages of his autobiography, The Thrill of the Chase. “Begin it where warm waters halt / And take it in the canyon down, / Not far, but too far to walk. / Put in below the home of Brown,” reads the second stanza of Fenn’s poem that would send treasure hunters to scour five western states.  On 7 June, Fenn, a former air force fighter pilot turned art and antiquities dealer, told the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper that a man from the eastern US had recently located his treasure, which has variously been valued anywhere from $1m to $2m. According to Fenn’s website, it was found “under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago”. Neither the name of the finder nor the location of the treasure has been disclosed. “I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot,” Fenn wrote on his website.  The discovery marks the end of a modern-day treasure hunt unlike any in history. “This has been a horrible ending to something that has been so extremely important in my life for eight years,” said Cynthia Meachum, who is part of a vibrant “chase” community of Fenn treasure seekers. “It has affected me a lot more than I thought it ever would.” According to Fenn, the idea that came to inspire so many was conceived in 1988 after he was diagnosed with cancer. The prospect of death made him think to leave part of his fortune, and even his own bones, in a treasure chest somewhere in the mountains. When Fenn recovered, the idea persisted, and he meticulously curated the contents of the chest for years.  Fenn described a “necklace that’s about 2,000 years old, and it has fetishes made out of quartz crystal and cast gold jaguar claws, and it’s absolutely wonderful”, in a 2018 interview with the Guardian. “There are two ancient Chinese jade carvings of human faces. You just want to cry when you see them.” Fenn hoped the treasure would be an adventure that could get people “off the couch” and into the outdoors.  “He provided us all with great adventure,” said Dent, who searched twice a week for years in northern New Mexico. Yet in the course of looking for Fenn’s chest, as many as five people have died, and Fenn has been criticized for endangering lives, enabling an unhealthy obsession, and even lying about the treasure’s existence. “I would implore him that he stop this nonsense,” the New Mexico state police chief, Pete Kassetas, said after a treasure hunter’s body was retrieved from the Rio Grande River in 2017, days after he had gone missing. He told ABC: “I want people to have fun, and I want people to be adventurous, but the reality is when you have $2m or so, as it’s rumored to be, at stake, people make poor decisions.” There are the stories of people quitting their jobs and emptying their bank accounts to join the chase. Fenn himself has received death threats and been the victim of break-in attempts at his house.  Others have claimed the whole thing is an outright hoax.  “I believe there never was any hidden treasure,” said Linda Bilyeu, the ex-wife of Randy Bilyeu, who died searching for the treasure. “Fenn is a corrupt man who seeks attention any which way he could achieve.” The controversy has continued even after its purported discovery. The absence of photos or information on the location of the chest has led some to question whether it was found at all – though Fenn has promised to elaborate in the coming days. “Give us something, so we know if we were close,” said Meachum, who made 200 trips and invested thousands of hours. “ I have no closure at this point.” “A third think it’s a hoax,” said Dent. “A third think it was never found. And then there are the rest of us that think this is great. Someone found it. Now let’s move on with our lives.” Dent, who estimates she has taken 300 trips in search of the treasure, added that no good can come of knowing its location. “What if you were 100% right and just missed it? Or what if you find out you didn’t have anything part of it right, and had wasted all that time? As long as we don’t know the location, we can each be right in our own minds,” she said. Even so, she felt enriched by the quest, if not the actual treasure. The victor “did something tens of thousands of people have failed to do. If I could say anything to the finder, I would tell him congratulations. We wish you all the happiness in the world.”"
"Three major insurance groups that provided cover for parts of the Adani coal project in Queensland have said they will not provide future policies to the project. AXA XL, Liberty Mutual and HDI have told Guardian Australia they will not have any further involvement in the project after previously providing insurance cover that has now expired. The names of the three companies, together with one other insurer, appear on a file seen by Guardian Australia as having provided insurance cover for the project. Construction has started on the Adani coal site – one of the most controversial fossil fuel projects in Australia’s history. The mine and its railway will export coal through Adani’s Abbot Point terminal to power plants. Insurance broker Marsh has reportedly been working with Adani since 2015 and like other companies has come under pressure from campaigners to walk away due to coal’s contribution to the climate crisis. A spokesperson for AXA XL told Guardian Australia the company “do not currently have a live insurance policy for the Carmichael mine’s assets, neither directly nor through packages, and we do not intend to do so in the future.” The spokesperson said the policy had provided “a period of residue cover for work defaults” and that this expired in 2021. The decision to break ties with the Adani project was related to a new company policy on coal, announced in January 2020. The spokesperson added that “we are all committed to a long-term ‘exit’ strategy reducing exposure to the thermal coal industry to zero by 2030 in the European Union and OECD countries, and by 2040 in the rest of the world”. A spokesperson for Liberty Mutual said the firm and its subsidiary Liberty Specialty Markets “do not have any current policies in place for the Adani Carmichael mine project”. Guardian Australia asked if the company had any ongoing involvement in the mine and its railway project. In a statement, the spokesperson added: “In January 2019, we informed the appropriate parties we would not be participating in the insurance program for the operational phase of the project. We will not have any further involvement in the Adani Carmichael mine project.” A previous policy covering early-works site construction had expired in October 2019 and the company remained “contractually obligated to a 24-month maintenance period for any defects that may arise in that specific construction following the conclusion of the period of insurance”. The spokesperson said the company recognised the risk of climate change and had a new “Office of Sustainability” that would “embed responsible investment and risk management policies into our decision-making.” The company’s 2019 environment review said “the world needs to retain some level of balance between fossil fuels and renewable sources while making the transition to a fully decarbonised system”. The company had a policy, the report said, to make no new investments in debt or equity securities of companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal mining and to “phase out coverage and investments for existing risks that exceed this threshold by 2023”. Two other insurers named on the files seen by Guardian Australia were Aspen RE and HDI. A statement from HDI Global said the company “is not an insurer of the Adani Carmichael coal mine project” and Guardian Australia understands this includes the railway that is part of the Carmichael project. The statement said the company could not rule out that one or more of its Australian customers could be among the mine’s contractors. The statement said the company – part of the German-owned Talanx Group – would no longer underwrite any risks for newly planned coal-fired power stations or coalmines. By 2038, the company aimed to no longer have any coal plants or mines in its portfolio. “It is part of our fundamental business principles not to grant any direct insurance cover to projects like the Adani Carmichael coal mine,” the statement said. A Marsh employee who has been a commercial risk manager for more than two years with the company, but who asked not to be named, said the insurance broker had “lost domestic clients over this already” and that some colleagues were “concerned about where Marsh stands on climate change and what we represent”. There was concern among some employees, the manager claimed, of the impact of the mine on the land and culture of the Wangan and Jagalingou people. In May, the company’s parent group, Marsh & McLennan, released a one-page “client engagement principles” document, saying the firm had a commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on climate change. That goal does not include specific temperature targets, unlike the UN’s Paris climate agreement. The document was branded as “greenwash” by campaigners. A spokesperson for Marsh told Guardian Australia the company had a “long-standing policy not to comment on the identity of clients” and pointed to its client engagement principles. “These principles do not contain a bright-line policy against any industry. Rather, we will evaluate proposed engagements that potentially conflict with these goals and determine whether work can proceed as proposed or with limitations.” The spokesperson said Marsh had adopted recommendations of the international Financial Security Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures – a project chaired by Michael Bloomberg that encourages financial institutions and companies to disclose their exposure to risks from climate change. A spokesperson for Aspen Insurance said the company could not discuss individual policies, adding: “We are currently reviewing our underwriting appetite around fossil fuel but cannot comment further at this time.” Aspen “understands the importance of environmental, social and governance issues,” the spokesperson said, and the company had joined a UN leadership platform “for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices.” In January, the Australian coach company Greyhound cut ties with a contractor building the Adani mine railway after Guardian Australia revealed its association with the coal project. Pablo Brait, a campaigner at Market Forces, a group working to highlight financial links between companies and fossil fuel projects, said: “The fact that there are more than a dozen insurers who have said that they won’t go near the Adani project speaks to the reputational risk that any company that underwrites it faces. “Most insurance policies have expiry dates and we encourage any company underwriting the project either with Adani directly or through a contractor to refuse to renew any policies when they come up for renewal or expire.” An Adani spokesperson said: “Details on insurance providers for the Carmichael Project are commercial in confidence, however we have the requisite insurance requirements in place.”"
"Marco* felt the phlegm gather heavily on his chest for five days before he called his local health centre and told them he worked at the meat plant. He was tested within hours – the result was positive. “One hundred per cent, I know I got it in the factory,” he says. “If the disease was in the animals, they’d have closed the place. But for workers, the factories can do what they want.” Marco is one of a number of workers who have contacted the Guardian about conditions in some meat plants since the pandemic began. Speaking on condition of anonymity, workers in factories across Ireland and Northern Ireland say that not enough was done at the start of the outbreak to minimise their exposure, and that though some protective measures are now in place, they still don’t feel safe at work. For Marco, who has worked at the same factory for more than a decade, it’s too little, too late. “I felt frightened, “ he says. “The damage has been done.” Life as a meat plant worker is a low-wage, bloody business, workers told the Guardian. “It’s horrible killing cows, when you see how they do it,” says Florin*, a Romanian worker who has been employed in a meat plant in the Republic of Ireland for more than five years said. “They kill it – shoot it, cut the neck, cut the legs. I don’t like it. The cow is slow, an emotional thing. And you see the blood, and they go from being alive to being in pieces. That’s the way. When you see the conditions – it’s a dirty and nasty place, nobody is happy.” Temperatures in the factories can hover at 4C, with industrial ceiling fans that circulate cool air to keep the meat free of microbes. The job is repetitive and tough; workers take painkillers to get through their shifts. Now countries across the world with industrialised meat supply chains are grappling with serious coronavirus outbreaks in meat and processed food plants. Official figures show that there have been outbreaks at 12 plants in the Republic of Ireland and 571 workers have tested positive. In Northern Ireland, union officials have raised serious concerns, and last week one worker died.  Workers point to bottlenecks in toilets and washrooms; the locker-rooms, where workers pile in before and after work; and the canteens, where they gather to eat. The greatest risks are during eight-hour shifts on the factory floor where they work half a metre or less apart from colleagues on the production line. They say factories have not been making sure that workers had personal protective equipment, or abiding by social distancing guidelines. “There was no social distancing,” says Marco. “You had to go through areas where everyone was on top of themselves, sneezing and coughing.” “They didn’t give us masks or gloves. We had to buy our own,” said Florin. “People are scared, they say it’s not safe.” On top of the lack of safety equipment, the fact that migrants make up the vast majority of the workforce in the meat industry is also a problem, with many travelling from Timor-Leste, Lithuania, China, Poland, South Africa, Romania, Bulgaria and Brazil to work. Marco says that in his factory not enough information was given to non-English speakers about how they could keep themselves – and those around them – safe from infection. In general, migrant workers have settled well into Irish life. Pablo*, who was recruited from his home town in Africa, says he has always felt welcomed by local people. But in the factory, where he earns about €11.80 (£10.40) an hour, life is hard. Workers feel intimidated and vulnerable, and are unable to stand up for their legal rights, he says. “People are not being treated with dignity and respect.” Pablo says that until a few weeks ago, apart from posting government notices about Covid-19 on the walls, his factory didn’t put anything in place to protect its workers. “There was no checking of temperature, no masks, no 2-metre social distancing. When we asked for masks, they said no.” He says he he doesn’t feel safe at work, and is sure that he will get infected with the virus. “New workers are brought in to replace people who are out sick, but we don’t know if they’ve been screened.” Because of their low pay, many migrant workers live in communal houses and some have to share bedrooms. “They don’t feel safe, but they have to work,” says Adriana*, a Polish worker at a meat factory in Northern Ireland. There are perspex screens in parts of the factory and workers’ temperatures are now checked, but there is still no distancing inside the factory, and workers are afraid. Santos*, a Brazilian worker in a meat plant south of the border, says that many of his fellow workers have poor levels of English and aren’t aware of their rights, such as welfare support if they are sick. “If these people have the virus, who will help them? How will they get food?” Following his positive diagnosis for the virus, Marco is now recovering at home. He gets a weekly payment from the government, and he says his health is OK. But he wants an investigation into what has gone on in the meat factories. “I’m so angry – how can a government allow this? They forgot about us, they did not care. It’s shocking.” * Names have been changed We want to hear from you about your experiences and stories from inside the farming industry. Please get in touch.

"The dew point is the temperature at which a certain area of air must be cooled to for dew to form. It is also commonly interpreted as a measure of the air’s moisture content. As air cools, the amount of the gaseous form of water it is capable of holding decreases, and as such, cooling will eventually result in it reaching saturation point, beyond which condensation into liquid water droplets occurs. This is the main process behind cloud formation in the atmosphere. Of course, dew can also form on surfaces on earth. When the surface (for example grass or cars) cools below the dew point temperature of the air adjacent, condensation droplets from the air deposit onto that surface. If surface temperatures fall below 0C and below the dew point temperature, instead of water vapour gas condensing to water droplets, it transitions directly to crystals of ice, in the form of frost. While frost formation in winter months is rather common, surface temperatures in autumn or in spring are less likely to fall down to the air’s dew point, aided by the shorter overnight cooling periods. Hence, dew and frost do not form as readily, especially on objects which can have larger stores of heat in them, such as roads."
"While most cruise ship passengers have now made it back to land, another crisis has been growing – with no safe haven in sight. Around the world, more than 100,000 crew workers are still trapped on cruise ships, at least 50 of which have Covid-19 infections, a Guardian investigation has found. They are shut out of ports and banned from air travel that would allow them to return to their homes. Many of these crew are quarantined in tiny cabins, and some have had their pay cut off. They have in effect become a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to Dubai port. Many of the crew have only minimal communication with the outside world, making their situations hard to scrutinise. But at least 17 cruise ship workers are confirmed to have died from suspected Covid-19, and dozens more have had to be evacuated from ships and taken to hospital, the Guardian found. “We all have family, we all want to go home,” said one crew member who has been isolating in his cabin onboard the MSC Seaview off South America for nearly a month, but is no longer being paid. The worker, who spoke via the internet and asked not to be named for fear of losing his job, said crew were initially allowed to move about the ship freely, but have been told to remain in their cabins since a worker who had already left the ship tested positive for Covid-19. “We have not received any information about when we’re going home or what they are doing to get crew members home,” said the worker. “We are just in the cabin like prisoners.” A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: “MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating, we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships’ operations. “We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge, assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use. We’ve upgraded our menus, and are providing complimentary internet.” Most industry workers hail from developing countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and India and generally earn between $1,000–$2,000 (£800- £1,600) a month for working seven days a week, according to Ross Klein, a professor at St John’s College in Newfoundland who has written four books on the cruise industry. Documents seen by the Guardian show that at least one cruise line has stopped paying some workers who are trapped onboard. Those who died in April include two housekeeping staff, a bartender and a security guard who were evacuated from ships in Florida. An Italian ship’s doctor died in Brazil after being taken by ambulance from the Costa Fascinosa cruise ship, and an engine worker on the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer died in Uruguay after 128 of the 217 people onboard tested positive for coronavirus. Yet many nations, including the US, have baulked at providing even basic emergency services for these stranded crew members. “Some of these crews are in a no man’s land,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer. He said crew members did not have access to the rights afforded by their nations of citizenship, yet they were often outside the jurisdiction of the countries where their ships were sailing. Most of the cruise companies are registered in low-tax, low-regulation nations such as Panama or Liberia, with their ships flying the flags of territories such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which are not prepared to care for thousands of sick crew. “It’s a big problem,” he said. “We are getting calls left and right. Crews are onboard, they’re not happy and they’re frightened.” As of 4 April, the US Coast Guard estimated that 93,000 crew members remained onboard ships  in and around US waters alone. Tens of thousands more are on ships in other parts of the world, according to the Guardian’s analysis, which used the ship tracking site CruiseMapper and media reports to identify more than 50 ships that have had Covid-19 infections or confirmed exposures onboard. Cruises around the world were suspended on 14 March, yet many ports refused to let the ships dock long before that, meaning some crews have been stuck at sea for months. Cruise industry officials say they have been scrambling to repatriate crews that are not needed onboard during the shutdown, but port closures, travel bans and flight restrictions have made it extremely difficult. Some countries, including India, have almost completely sealed their borders, even to citizens. “The industry is committed to bringing passengers and crew home at its expense – without burdening governments,” the Cruise Line Industry Association said in a statement to the Guardian. “Flight restrictions and port closures have created some logistical challenges; however we are working through those as we speak. We are asking ports and governments around the world to allow these ships to come into port so that those onboard can make their way home safely and as quickly as possible.” Thousands of crew are sick or have been exposed to coronavirus. Outbreaks are raging in US waters, from the Miami coastline, where at least nine workers have been evacuated from the Royal Caribbean Oasis of the Seas, to the docks of San Diego, where workers onboard the Disney Wonder have contracted coronavirus. In France, workers preparing to launch the new Celebrity Apex contracted Covid-19 even before the ship carried its first passengers. Some ships have medical supplies but few are equipped to handle full-blown outbreaks. All crew on the MSC Seaview are obliged to wear a mask and gloves onboard the cruise ship, which has basic medical equipment, a small emergency room and a laboratory. At least two doctors are caring for people on the vessel. “All crew members currently onboard are healthy and none have displayed any symptoms,” a spokesperson for MSC cruises said. “MSC Seaview has a full onboard medical centre equipped and staffed in line with the highest and most stringent international guidelines. We continue to conduct regular health and temperature checks to ensure their health.” The hundreds of crew members onboard the Ruby Princess ship, which departed from Australia on Thursday, marked their 30th day in quarantine on the ship on last week with a video thanking the medical workers who have cared for them. But the ships generally lack ventilators and other complicated medical equipment needed to treat Covid-19. In serious medical emergencies, passengers and crew on cruise ships are normally evacuated to a hospital on land for further care. Since the pandemic began, however, many countries are refusing to take them."
"I found the remains of the blackbird on the strip of rough grass between the hedge and a group of small holly trees. The drift of pale feathers drew my eye first, left in a generous arc where they had fallen after being plucked from the body. Apart from the tail, legs and sternum, little remained of the bird itself, a small adult female, possibly one of those raised in the same hedge last summer. It seemed to have been eaten from the top down, perhaps the same direction from which it had been attacked, and I ran over in my mind the list of possible assailants. In this quiet wooded corner my suspicions soon fell on our local sparrowhawk. Only an occasional, solitary visitor to the garden, this hawk has shown an especially messy interest in the growing number of collared doves that frequent the beech trees along the lane. They are almost the perfect prey – large, slow-moving and seemingly not very observant – and I have seen them fall victim to the hawk on at least two occasions. The first time was an early July morning a few years ago. As I opened the curtains to look across the valley, the sparrowhawk was directly below me in the rough grass, just a few yards from where I would find today’s blackbird, standing on top of a dove and starting to eat. The window was open and the wooden clunk of the curtain rail made it look up. I stayed perfectly still as we regarded each other – then it took flight and jinked away through the trees, leaving me to literally pick up the pieces. More recently, at dusk in early October, I was alerted by a heavy impact against the glazed back door. It sounded as though a football had hit it, but the perfectly defined bird-shaped grease mark left on the glass told another story. The sparrowhawk perched briefly on a nearby bench, shaking its head as though stunned, before lurching away, leaving its kill behind. This second collared dove was eventually scavenged by a red kite, as perhaps were the remains of the blackbird. Very little goes to waste in the rural food chain."
"Hopes that Kangaroo Island’s unique mouse-like dunnart can be saved from extinction have been boosted after the tiny marsupial was captured on camera at a new location. More than 90% of the threatened Kangaroo Island dunnart’s habitat was burned in bushfires in early January. Now conservationists are focusing efforts on an unburnt patch and are working around the clock to set sensor cameras, build protective tunnels and trap feral cats that have moved into the area in the island’s west. New sensor cameras have detected dunnarts at three locations on a 222-hectare private property in the north-west of the island – one of 10 properties that are part of the unburnt area that’s only a few thousand hectares. Ecologist Heidi Groffen, of Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife, said the unburnt patch was “incredibly important” for the future of the species and she was “jumping for joy” when the cameras spotted the dunnarts. “These images prove that this property is supporting a dunnart population,” she said. “It’s exciting and a credit to farm fire units and firefighters that this critical habitat escaped the flames, as surrounding properties to the south, east and west were badly burned.” Darren Grover, of WWF-Australia, which funded the new camera traps, said: “This is a species that won’t survive without a helping hand. “That’s why it’s so important to monitor and manage threats in these few sites that are providing a refuge for the remaining dunnarts.” The Kangaroo Island Dunnart – weighing only about 25 grams – was already critically endangered before the fires, with estimates there were fewer than 500 remaining. But after the fire, Griffin says this number may be as low as 50. After the fires, Groffen says that feral cats moved into the unburnt areas and were now a key threat to the dunnart’s survival. “We now have cat traps open that surround this bushland and a full-time staff member just working to trap them. I don’t think the cats were hit at all by the fires. We’ve caught more than 30 around one fence line at Western River. “Considering that property had been managed for cats, it shows how the cats survived and are on the move looking for unburnt areas. This cat control is our number one priority. One cat could wipe out a whole population.” Cats that are caught are euthanised, Groffen said, and their stomachs examined for clues about what species they have been preying on. At the same time, small protective tunnels with entrances too small for cats and other predators like raptors and goannas have been installed to give a refuge to dunnarts and other threatened species. The camera traps have also caught the dunnarts using the tunnels. Dunnarts are elusive creatures that live in burrows. Groffen admitted that even though she had been working to protect them for three years, she has still only ever seen one on a camera image. But she said they were hoping to secure more funds to be able to trap and tag dunnarts to give ecologists more information about their numbers and where they might be."
"Thousands of blue tits have been found sick or dead in Germany, prompting an investigation by conservation groups and scientists.More than 11,000 cases of dead and sick birds, mostly blue tits, have been reported to the German conservation group NABU in the past fortnight. Most of these are reported from the west of Germany. The blue tit is found across Europe and is one of the most common visitors to UK gardens. They eat insects, caterpillars, seeds and nuts and can be spotted all year round in the UK, with the exception of some Scottish islands.According to NABU, symptoms of the diseased birds include breathing problems, no longer taking food and making no attempt to escape when approached by people. The group is advising people to stop feeding or providing drinking troughs for birds to reduce the risk of transmission between them. The first laboratory test results on the dead birds have found a bacterial infection (Suttonella ornithocola) that has been known in the UK since the 1990s and which affects birds similarly. The infection was reported in Germany in 2018. Further test results on birds are expected over the next few days.The infection discovered causes pneumonia in tits – predominantly blue tits – and they become lethargic with fluffed-up plumage and breathing difficulties. There are no reports of this affecting any other animals apart from birds. Dr Becki Lawson, a disease specialist at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), said she had not yet seen any recent increase in mortality in blue tits or any other garden bird species in the UK. “We are aware of the recent reports of blue tit mortality from Germany and understand investigations are under way to determine the cause,” Lawson said. “Once a diagnosis is reached, we will be able to comment on whether the condition affecting blue tit populations in Germany is one that we also see in Great Britain.” A spokesperson for the RSPB said the risk to UK bird populations was currently extremely low. “This disease predominantly affects blue tits which are largely sedentary birds and do not move far from where they fledged. If this disease is not already present in the UK, transmission across countries from Germany to the UK will be slow,” they said.Members of the public have been urged to report any sick or dead blue tits through Garden Wildlife Health, a monitoring project run between the ZSL, the British Trust for Ornithology, Froglife and the RSPB."
"While the world may feel rather grey at times right now, lockdown has at least enabled some people to go green and inject colour into their gardens. Britain is blooming – in one sense at least – with a record demand for seeds, and delphiniums, hollyhocks and hydrangeas are having their moment in the sun. The Seed Co-operative, which is owned and run by its members, has reported that orders are up to six times higher than a year ago. Meanwhile, the Royal Horticultural Society has seen a fivefold rise in queries for advice on its website during the lockdown. David Price, the cooperative’s managing director, said: “We’ve had good levels of stock, but lots of others are now running out.” Due to “exceptional demand” at a time when staffing numbers are low due to lockdown, the company is limiting customers’ time on its website with online sales only able to take place in a two-hour window every Sunday evening. Price welcomed the boom but warned that current demand could mean that supplies are limited in coming years. “We’re running on multi-annual production schedules, so it could become a real issue in a few years, when seed supply hasn’t had time to replenish,” he added. In Scotland, the wildflower seed specialists Kabloom, popular for their “seedboms”, says it has seen its sales soar tenfold since the end of March. Its starch-based, compostable, hand-grenade shaped plantable containers, which are designed to burst on impact with the ground, are full of compost and seeds. Meanwhile in the Dyfi Valley, in mid-Wales, sisters Tala Sutton, eight, and Sirena, five, have become part of a community-wide scheme to grow more flowers. “I quite like watching the plants grow,” Tala told the BBC. “I can’t wait to see how big my sunflower gets.” Sirena added: “It feels good planting seeds and waiting for the flowers and food.” People around the world are turning to gardening as a soothing, family-friendly hobby that also eases concerns over food security as lockdowns slow the harvesting and distribution of some crops. Fruit and vegetable seed sales are not only jumping in the UK but have gone up worldwide. In the US, Jaime Calder, a magazine editor, explained how she all but gave up on gardening after moving from the fertile soils of Illinois to dusty Texas, but the coronavirus changed her mind. Calder and her family of five planted collard greens, chard, onions, blackberries, watermelons and peppers this year, expanding their garden while buckling down at home during the pandemic. “It’s supplementary gardening,” said Calder. “There’s no way this would sustain a family of five. But we’re amping it up, so we can try and avoid the store a little more in the coming months.” Meanwhile Russians are isolating in out-of-town cottages with plots of land, a traditional source of vegetables during tough times since the Soviet era, and rooftop farms are planned in Singapore, which relies heavily on food imports. “Planting a few potatoes can be quite a revelation to a child,” said Guy Barter, the chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society, which has been inundated with queries for advice on its website. Gardeners without yards are planting potatoes in rubbish bags, he said."
"In the first months of 2020 Britain relied on renewable energy like never before. The power generated by clean energy projects eclipsed fossil fuels for the first time ever, making up almost half the electricity used to keep the lights on. As the UK emerges from the financial maelstrom of the coronavirus pandemic, analysts, economists and environmentalists argue that the renewable energy industry could – and should – play a greater role, powering a green economic recovery too. The companies harnessing energy from the sun, wind and sea hold the potential to spur the UK’s economy by attracting billions in investment and creating thousands of green jobs across the UK’s regions while accelerating Britain’s climate ambitions. Britain’s clean energy sector proved this point in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis and the Confederation of British Industry calculated that the green economy contributed a third of the UK’s economic growth in 2010-11. Britain’s traditional economic engines – the banks and financial services firms – had continued to flounder, leaving GDP growth struggling below 1% while the economic value of offshore wind climbed by almost 17% and the solar industry’s growth was almost 7%. The CBI report concluded that the so-called “choice” between going green or going for growth was a false one because green business was already on track to become a major pillar of Britain’s future growth. “After the last financial crisis, the UK’s green economy contributed substantially to new fiscal growth, supporting tens of thousands of jobs and finding new export markets around the world,” says Nathan Bennett of RenewableUK. “Once again, our industry will play a proactive role in getting the economy back on track, as we move out of lockdown. Renewables are a UK-wide opportunity to have a sustainable, forward-looking recovery and to boost productivity across the economy.” Today, much of the risk shouldered by renewable energy investors a decade ago has fallen away alongside plummeting technology costs. The UK’s commitment to pursuing a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 alongside its established financial support frameworks offer far more certainty to willing investors than in the past. The investment case for renewables is flattered further by the relative gloom shrouding investment opportunities elsewhere: fossil fuels have fallen from favour among a growing number of investors due to climate concerns and the collapse of global market prices for oil, gas and coal in recent weeks. Oil investors may have been able to count on returns on equity of about 25% when prices hovered at $100 a barrel, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, but today that figure is below 10% and falling. The returns on equity invested in offshore wind is 11%, and for solar it is 8% despite falling electricity bills. Economists believe the renewable energy industry’s hard-fought financial clout combined with public policy support could create an economic and employment juggernaut capable of spurring the UK’s post-pandemic recovery while tackling the climate crisis too. “The climate emergency has not gone away,” says Bennett. “If anything, the Covid-19 pandemic has underlined the need to make sure our economy is sustainable and resilient in the long term.” Globally renewable energy could power an economic recovery from Covid-19 by spurring global GDP gains of almost $100tn (£80tn) between now and 2050, compared with a business-as-usual scenario, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). Irena said the coronavirus outbreak had exposed “the deep vulnerabilities of the current system” and urged governments to invest in renewable energy to kickstart economic growth and help meet climate targets. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, one of the UK’s biggest renewable energy investors, says it is no overstatement to say that “the economic and environmental advantages of investment in a green recovery are aligned as never before”. Scottish Power is poised to invest billions in the UK’s renewable energy industry in the coming years, including an onshore wind renaissance after the government’s U-turn on blocking financial support for onshore turbines. The investment plans mapped out by Scottish Power and other renewable energy giants have remained intact through the pandemic while oil majors have slashed billions from their spending plans and warned that job losses are likely later in the year. “The best thing about it is that you’re investing for the next 40 years in clean energy,” says Anderson. “There’s a whole load of other infrastructure work you could do in the UK, but the thing about investing in renewables is that it is just as good at creating jobs and kickstarting the economy – but the added benefit is that you’d be tackling climate change at the same time.” The Social Market Foundation believes there could be long-term benefits for workers too. The thinktank called last week for the government to help train those left jobless by the looming financial recession to work in the low-carbon economy. The government could spur the economy, accelerate its climate ambitions and help kickstart social mobility, it said. The “net zero” industries, which include clean energy, electricity networks, car-charging infrastructure and energy efficiency, could help provide new jobs for many of the 1.4 million people expected to be left unemployed following the pandemic. The SMF has estimated that in some parts of the country, the number of green jobs that need to be filled to meet the climate goal is equal to half the number of people who were unemployed before the coronavirus crisis. “There is a pressing need to provide better support for those who lose work in this crisis,” says Kathryn Petrie, the SMF’s chief economist. “But also an opportunity. A well-designed guarantee of work and training could protect people from lasting damage, support UK skills and support the greening of the economy.” But the potential upsides could still slip away without decisive action to grasp the opportunity to reset the UK economy on a sustainable green foundation. The International Energy Agency’s executive director, Fatih Birol, has called on governments to devise stimulus plans that put the green energy agenda at the heart of the economic recovery. Anderson says there is not a moment to lose. “This is our message to the government: now is the time to do it. Investors are very keen to push money this way, and into these projects. The UK has a fantastic opportunity to grab a huge slice of the world’s renewable energy investment today. Now is the time.”"
"The government has allocated £15m in additional funding to Natural England for this financial year after a decade of cuts that have left England’s wildlife agency “in crisis”. Natural England’s chairman, Tony Juniper, said the funding marked a “significant change of trend” in the financing of the government body, which has seen its budget slashed by £180m since 2008. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – which sponsors Natural England – allocated the additional funds after positive discussions about the importance of reversing wildlife decline in the UK, Juniper told the Guardian. “I am hoping later this year we can look to secure the resources we need for ambitious nature recovery across the country for a multi-year period,” he said. Natural England has a range of responsibilities including monitoring the country’s most important wildlife sites, advising on planning applications and paying farmers to protect wildlife. Defra’s funding for the agency plummeted from £265m in 2008-09 to a low point of £85.6m in 2019-20. The inadequate funding of the UK’s natural environment departments had a “profound, negative impact on England’s biodiversity”, the House of Lords Select Committee concluded in 2018. This year’s additional funding will take Natural England’s grant-in-aid budget up to around £100m; £4m of the additional money comes from Defra’s £30m biodiversity fund, announced last year. But critics argue that the extra funding does not go far enough. The conservationist Mark Avery of Wild Justice described the announcement as “a smidgen of good news”.  “Well done, Tony, for getting back a small fraction of the money Defra has hacked out of Natural England over the past decade,” he said. The Green party peer Natalie Bennett said: “The government must not be allowed to get away with celebrating a measly announcement of an extra £15m grant as any kind of restoration. That’s just 10% of what has been cut since 2009.” Juniper, who became chair of Natural England in April 2019, said the increase was the first step to getting funding back to 2008 levels. “We felt it would be necessary for us to get back to that kind of funding level in order for us to do what was needed to fully implement the government’s 25-year environment plan,” he said. Of the £15m, £4m will be allocated to monitoring and improving sensitive sites, known as sites of special scientific interest, which cover 8% of the UK – the equivalent of 1m hectares – and contain “special” habitats, geology, plants or animals. Less than 40% of SSSI sites are in “favourable” condition and more than half have not been monitored in six years or more due to severe budget cuts and staff shortages. The government missed its 2010 target to restore half of SSSIs to favourable condition by 2020. The rest of the funding has been ring-fenced for other core statutory duties such as advising on the environmental impact of planning applications, licensing work and improving national nature reserves, Juniper said. He would also like to invest in more large-scale landscape recovery projects, such as Dorset’s Purbeck Heaths super national nature reserve, which started in March. A report by the Prospect union in January last year concluded that staff at Natural England were in “in crisis”. Internal reports show there were 2,661 permanent staff at the organisation in 2007 compared with 1,786 in March last year, resulting in roles being amalgamated and high levels of stress for workers. One anonymous employee, who left last summer, after two years working for the organisation said it was the “most humiliating professional experience I’ve ever had”.  “I’ve got two first-class degrees from Oxbridge, I’ve got years of experience and I earned £20,000 for four days a week,” she said. “They couldn’t increase my hours. I ended up working five days anyway. I had to leave because I had to work two other jobs to make ends meet.” Juniper said he was working with the union to review pay and conditions at Natural England and hoped to do more to support staff. “It’s not only issues of pay that have concerned me since I arrived, but issues of workload, with some people having multiple roles. This is a reflection of the dedication of the staff who have been working extremely hard to maintain the service that we provide for the country.” Juniper acknowledged there was “still quite a long way” to go to secure nature’s recovery. He said: “I came into an organisation that had a number of challenges and I do think that after my first year we are beginning to meet some of them in terms of rebuilding the confidence of the organisation … I’m delighted to see that the budget increase this year is just putting some more fuel in the tank.” A Defra spokesperson said Natural England does vital work protecting the environment, water, invaluable natural spaces, and wildlife. “That is why we have provided Natural England with over £11m in additional funding to ensure they are able to not only protect our natural environment but also improve it for future generations.” The conservationist and author Peter Marren, who has recently written about the decline of Natural England for British Wildlife magazine, said Defra’s comment about improving the natural environment “betrays a depth of ignorance”. “It presumably equates improvement with planting trees or leaving corners in public parks for the nettles. The real wild environment – our remaining old woods, downs, heaths, semi-natural meadows, moors, bogs, rivers, ponds and lakes, are in a terrible state and getting worse,” he said. “I don’t think there’s a great deal anyone can do to offset the loss significantly, but a properly funded Natural England would at least be able to address some of the issues on protected sites.” Kate Jennings, the head of site conservation policy at the RSPB, said there was a huge amount of ground to recover if the government was serious about tackling the nature crisis. “The RSPB has repeatedly called for Natural England to be given the resources and the independence that it needs to do its job properly, and so the announcement of an increase in funding is really a welcome first step in the right direction,” she said. Craig Bennett, the CEO of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “While it is welcome to hear about a modest increase in funding for Natural England, they will still be left with an overall budget that is much lower than it was decades previously, at a time when ministers have said we’re facing an ecological emergency. “There is still a long way to go before funding is back to historical levels, or indeed to what is needed to reverse the declines in the abundance of nature we’re experiencing in this country.”"
"Beer and soft drinks could soon be sipped from “all-plant” bottles under new plans to turn sustainably grown crops into plastic in partnership with major beverage makers. A biochemicals company in the Netherlands hopes to kickstart investment in a pioneering project that hopes to make plastics from plant sugars rather than fossil fuels. The plans, devised by renewable chemicals company Avantium, have already won the support of beer-maker Carlsberg, which hopes to sell its pilsner in a cardboard bottle lined with an inner layer of plant plastic. Avantium’s chief executive, Tom van Aken, says he hopes to greenlight a major investment in the world-leading bioplastics plant in the Netherlands by the end of the year. The project, which remains on track despite the coronavirus lockdown, is set to reveal partnerships with other food and drink companies later in the summer. The project has the backing of Coca-Cola and Danone, which hope to secure the future of their bottled products by tackling the environmental damage caused by plastic pollution and a reliance on fossil fuels. Globally around 300 million tonnes of plastic is made from fossil fuels every year, which is a major contributor to the climate crisis. Most of this is not recycled and contributes to the scourge of microplastics in the world’s oceans. Microplastics can take hundreds of years to decompose completely. “This plastic has very attractive sustainability credentials because it uses no fossil fuels, and can be recycled – but would also degrade in nature much faster than normal plastics do,” says Van Aken. Avantium’s plant plastic is designed to be resilient enough to contain carbonate drinks. Trials have shown that the plant plastic would decompose in one year using a composter, and a few years longer if left in normal outdoor conditions. But ideally, it should be recycled, said Van Aken. The bio-refinery plans to break down sustainable plant sugars into simple chemical structures that can then be rearranged to form a new plant-based plastic – which could appear on supermarket shelves by 2023. The path-finder project will initially make a modest 5,000 tonnes of plastic every year using sugars from corn, wheat or beets. However, Avantium expects its production to grow as demand for renewable plastics climbs. In time, Avantium plans to use plant sugars from sustainable sourced biowaste so that the rise of plant plastic does not affect the global food supply chain."
"A group of senior Australian scientists have warned in an international journal that logging native forests makes fire more severe and is likely to have exacerbated the country’s catastrophic summer bushfires. In a comment piece published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, the scientists call for a clearer discussion about how land management and forestry practices contribute to fire risk. The article by the scientists David Lindenmayer, Robert Kooyman, Chris Taylor, Michelle Ward and James Watson comes amid intense debate about the resumption of logging in Victoria and New South Wales in bushfire hit regions. In Victoria, the chief executive of state-owned timber agency VicForests, Monique Dawson, has previously defended plans to log fire-affected areas, saying it was focused on areas “where most of the free-standing trees have been killed”. In a letter of 15 April to the Goongerah Environment Centre, a community group based in East Gippsland, Dawson said VicForests did not accept Lindenmayer’s published opinions “as reflective of evidence and do not consider him to be an authority in these matters”. Lindenmayer, a widely published and cited ecologist and conservation biologist, said he was taking legal advice about the remarks in the letter. In the comment piece, the scientists say much of the conversation in the aftermath of the spring and summer bushfires had rightly focused on climate change, but the impact of land management and forestry on fire risk was often neglected in these discussions. They highlight this as a concern because land management policy was “well within the control of Australians” and the fires had been used by some sectors of the industry to call for increased logging in some areas. The paper says industry data showed that some 161m cubic metres of native forest was logged in the period from 1996 to 2018. “Beyond the direct and immediate impacts on biodiversity of disturbance and proximity to disturbed forest, there is compelling evidence that Australia’s historical and contemporary logging regimes have made many Australian forests more fire prone and contributed to increased fire severity and flammability,” the scientists write. This occurs because logging leaves debris at ground level that increases the fuel load in logged forests. It also changes forest composition and leaves these areas of forest both hotter and drier, they say. The article says during the bushfire season fire had spread from logged areas adjacent to old growth eucalypts and rainforests in the Gondwana world heritage reserves. In Victoria’s East Gippsland region, “extensive areas of logged and regenerated forest have burned repeatedly in the past 25 years”. They suggest a number of responses to reduce the risk of further catastrophic fire seasons, including the “removal of logging from areas where it adds considerably to fuel loads and creates forest structures that increase fire severity and risks to human safety”. They also call for restoration of previously logged forests to build resilience to future fire events. “In the event of wildfires, land managers must avoid practices such as ‘salvage’ logging – or logging of burnt forests – which severely reduces recovery of a forest,” Lindenmayer said. Instead, he said governments needed to confine timber supply to plantations and look at ways to accelerate the industry transition in states such as Victoria, which plans to phase out native forest logging by 2030. Watson said governments needed to have a “clearer conversation” about the impact logging had on fire risks and on the safety of communities in bushfire-prone areas. “Logging causes a rise in fuel loads, increases potential drying of wet forests and causes a decrease in forest height,” he said. “It can leave up to 450 tonnes of combustible fuel a hectare close to the ground – by any measure, that’s an incredibly dangerous level of combustible material in seasonally dry landscapes.” Australia’s natural disaster preparedness is currently being examined by the bushfires royal commission. Guardian Australia approached both the NSW and Victorian governments for comment."
"With a 3,600-mile non-stop solo sail across the Atlantic ahead of him, Garry Crothers is a little anxious. But he has to get moving before the hurricane season. “I’m in a bad place here, I don’t have any choice,” he says. Like many living aboard their sailing boats, he has been stranded at sea by Covid-19. The 64-year-old Irishman has been on Kind of Blue, his 43ft aluminium boat, for two months, hardly touching land. He’s anchored off Sint Maarten, in the Caribbean – a less pleasing prospect than it sounds. Hurricane season officially starts on 1 June and the island, as Crothers is acutely aware, is “bang in the middle of the hurricane belt” – hit hard by Dorian last year, and Irma in 2017. Neighbouring countries and islands that might afford protection are shut. Crothers’ only safe option is a solo sail home to Ireland. In one sense he’s not alone. An estimated 500 boats are crossing the Atlantic to Europe in the coming weeks. From the South Pacific to the Indian Ocean, thousands of people are trying to sail home or find shelter. While stranded cruise and navy ships have made headlines, far less attention has been paid to the plight of hundreds of families and individuals on small boats. As countries closed borders, numerous vessels were refused entry to their port of call. Even boats that had been safely anchored before the pandemic were suddenly considered a foreign yacht in territorial waters. Sailors in Portugal and Spain were ordered to return to home ports in the United States or Canada – a dangerous proposition without planning. From around the world, horror stories have emerged. Families with young children have been threatened with arrest, having their boats seized, or being towed out to open water for trying to anchor in sheltered bays, looking for food and water. Thousands have been left with nowhere to go and are undertaking risky passages. People sailing the coasts of Sri Lanka, India, and through the pirate-infested Gulf of Aden to the Horn of Africa, report being forced out to sea by navy gunboats patrolling coastlines. Many have been charged exorbitant prices for life-sustaining supplies as they rapidly run out of cash. Daria Blackwell of the Ocean Cruising Club (OCC) says risky journeys have become common: “One boat arrived in South Africa, was turned away and had to continue on to St Helena [a journey of more than 1,200 nautical miles] running short of food, fuel and water,” she says. It was headed for the US but, with non-citizens onboard, not guaranteed entry. The only place people can expect to be accepted – and therefore safe – is their home country. But that presents a problem of epic proportions. Many sailors are far from wealthy: their home is their boat, they hadn’t planned for a sudden ocean passage, and now have to cross in conditions they wouldn’t otherwise attempt. Lockdown means it has been impossible to source spares or safety gear ahead of the trip, while travel restrictions have meant many can’t get anyone to join as crew. And while most insurance policies stipulate certain crew numbers for the crossing, they also deny storm cover to boats left in hurricane zones. Like many others, Crothers has to choose the least worst option – face hurricane season or cross alone – both without cover. Even food provisioning is tricky. In Sint Maarten food shops have only recently reopened. “My other concern is trying to socially distance while getting supplies for the trip,” he says. “I’m in the age bracket where I can’t afford to get [coronavirus]. Or to get ill in the middle of the Atlantic.”  In these difficult circumstances, sailors are turning to one another for support. They are a resourceful breed – offshore cruising demands it, given the myriad problems that can arise in the middle of the ocean. The OCC has connected more than 150 boats in the west Atlantic heading for Europe: they’re sharing information and offering support on the crossing. This is not an organised flotilla – boats are leaving from as far afield as Antigua, Jamaica and Mexico to destinations ranging from Russia to the UK, Sweden to Greece. Skippers will make their own decisions on routes and speeds. However they’re jointly tracking journeys, so if problems arise there’s some prospect of help from others within range. In the first groups to leave, two boats with emergency medical workers and one with a surgeon onboard have offered assistance with medical support while at sea; one boat has helped another with water supply. Crothers has signed up to the list. He is an experienced sailor, but hasn’t done a transatlantic alone. The longest single-handed trip he’s done so far is five days. “Correction,” he says. “All my trips are single-handed.” After a car crash and years of pain, he had his left arm amputated in 2017. “My biggest worry is fixing things one-handed,” he says. “I’m pretty good, but it’s difficult without dropping things, and trying to hold on to the boat.” His first heading will be north, a route many are taking towards Bermuda. Once he has reached the high pressure area, he should pick up westerly winds to sail slowly towards the Azores. From there, he’ll head for Northern Ireland, taking more than three weeks. He has to sail conservatively. “Because if I go over, that’s it. It’s hard enough for an able man to get back on board – but with one hand?” The Azores have been a beacon of light in the Atlantic during this crisis. The archipelago, about 800 nautical miles off the coast of Portugal, is of huge strategic importance for boats crossing west to east. Countries along the Atlantic’s eastern shores – Morocco, Senegal, Spain, Portugal, France – have been turning away boats looking for shelter. Island nations such as Cape Verde, off the coast of Africa, lack infrastructure and healthcare to deal with Covid-19, so are more understandably off limits. As Blackwell points out, “People are so panicked in countries that don’t have adequate healthcare, they will do anything to protect themselves.” But grateful sailors have been reporting that they could anchor in Horta, the Azores’ port, with access to fuel and water. The islands have a long history of welcoming boats on transatlantic passages, and maritime institution Peter Cafe Sport has been taking food, medical supplies and marine parts to anchored boats. As welcome as this is, lying at anchor doesn’t afford full protection from weather, or the opportunity to rest, make repairs and plan in the middle of exhausting passages. Which is why sailors have been lobbying governments. Sailor and journalist Ole Sal has formally applied to the regional governments of Madeira and the Azores, and to Portugal, France and Spain, to provide safe havens, arguing that the lack of open ports is “increasing the risk of loss of life and damage to vessels”. In Lisbon, yachtmaster Veronique Claus has written to Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, on behalf of 30 international boats. “Certainly for those who are anchored in unsafe and non-sheltered waters, the situation is life-threatening,” she says, noting that two yachts have already been lost after breaking anchors. Crothers will pass near the Azores, but may not stop if restrictions mean he has to stay on anchor; dozens of others, however, including Britons Elena and John Nye, are counting on the stopover for fuel and water (their small boat won’t carry enough). The 33-year-olds, “relative newcomers” to sailing, set off from the British Virgin Islands for Norway on their 34ft sailboat, and hope to rest in the Azores before the onward journey. The Caledonian canal – a shortcut through the north of Scotland – is now closed, so they face a difficult passage via the Shetland Islands, where gale-force winds and perilous seas are common. They should get some shelter in the Western Isles, as the UK is operating some key ports and marinas for transit. For those heading east towards Spanish and Portuguese coasts, and into the Mediterranean for France, Italy, Greece and elsewhere, it’s a mixed picture. Select ports are allowing entry with authorisation, but authorities are policing territorial waters vigorously and it could be costly to get it wrong. In Athens, several Greek crews sailed into a port during lockdown, were fined €5,000 (£4,380) each by the coastguard and branded pirates in the national press. The Nyes are taking comfort from other boats making similar journeys. “It’s reassuring that there are others in the same daft situation,” John says. “It feels really good that in case of problems we can find out where the nearest boat is.” Crothers, whose final destination is Derry, Northern Ireland, is more circumspect. He is looking forward to a pint of Guinness, but the journey is long, and the illusion of strength in numbers falls away when you’re crossing the ocean in very different boats, with different speeds and routes. “Ultimately,” he says, “you’re alone out there.”"
"Some cruise companies have refused to agree to rules that would allow tens of thousands of stranded crew back to land, citing concerns about cost and potential legal consequences, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The largest trade association for the cruise industry has called the CDC’s requirements for disembarkation “impractical”. The standoff comes amid a deteriorating situation on many ships around the world and a rising death toll of crew members. More than 100,000 crew workers are still trapped on cruise ships globally, at least 50 of which have Covid-19 infections. This number includes around 80,000 crew members on 120 ships that are in international waters near the US waiting to disembark. Some major cruise operators have blamed the CDC for not allowing trapped crew to leave ships. But the health agency said it “stand[s] ready to approve these requests with same-day turnaround in most cases”, and has urged staff to contact cruise liners about disembarkation. The CDC confirmed it had detected hundreds of Covid-19 and Covid-like illness cases in crew since March in US waters, resulting in the deaths of at least six crew. A doctor on the Norwegian Gem, operated by Norwegian Cruise Line, died aboard the ship from a “respiratory illness” on Thursday.  The Miami Herald obtained internal Norwegian Cruise Line documents confirming the doctor’s death and assuring crew on the ship that he had died in his sleep from “cardio-respiratory arrest”, but had “no symptoms of Covid-19”. The Herald reported that the cruise company did not respond to their inquiries. Norwegian Cruise Line also did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. A third crew member on the Oasis of the Seas, currently off the coast of Florida, died in hospital on Sunday. The death of Carlos Baluran, who worked the night shift in the vessel’s incinerator, comes after the death of waiter Dexter Joyosa and Indonesian waiter Iputu Sugiartha in the last two weeks on the same ship. In a statement, the CDC told the Guardian that it is “allowing crew members to disembark from cruise ships in US waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed attestation stating that they have complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members”. It said: “These requirements include ensuring safe transportation by non-commercial means, providing cloth face coverings to crew members or ensuring they have their own, and providing instructions to crew members to stay home for 14 days after they reach their destination. “CDC shared this information with all cruise lines in US waters on 23 April 2020 to help crew members return home safely. Since then, CDC has received and approved signed attestations to disembark crew from 15 ships. “Some cruise lines have been unwilling to comply with the requirements to safely disembark their crew. Reasons include unwillingness to sign the attestation because of the legal consequences, and not wanting to pay for noncommercial transportation.” But Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest trade association for the cruise industry, said some of the CDC’s requirements were “impractical”. “To require employers to guarantee that every employee outside the workplace will fulfil all of the CDC’s stated requirements, including not having any interaction with the public whatsoever, with criminal sanctions at stake, is both unprecedented and impractical,” it said in a statement. On Monday, the first wrongful death lawsuit for a crew member was filed on behalf of the family of an Indonesian housekeeper on the Symphony of the Seas, operated by Royal Caribbean. The suit alleges that the company failed to protect staff by not implementing social distancing measures on board by allowing crew to hold parties and eat together. The company replied in a statement that it was working with authorities around the world to repatriate thousands of staff. It confirmed it had agreed to CDC restrictions to repatriate staff, and said it declined to comment on pending litigation. Asked what support it was providing crew in the wake of the three deaths on the Oasis of the Seas, it said: “We have our Employee Assistance Program that crew can call 24 hours a day and is confidential.” Carnival Cruise Line, which announced plans to restart operations at the beginning of August, said it would use 18 ships to repatriate more than 10,000 healthy crew members to Asia, Africa, Europe, India and Latin America. “The safety and wellbeing of our team members continues to be a top priority. Given the pause in our operations, we are committed to getting our crew members safely home to their families. We sincerely thank them for their hard work, patience and understanding during this process,” said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line. Alongside more than 100,000 crew, CLIA confirmed that 50 passengers remain at sea on five cruise ships – Celebrity Eclipse, Costa Deliziosa, Queen Mary 2, Caribbean Princess and Coral Princess – as of 29 April. So far, CLIA has recorded 2,789 confirmed cases of Covid-19 onboard 33 CLIA oceangoing cruise ships, but could not provide data relating to crew. “It’s a shame that it comes down to dollars and cents,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer in Miami, who has represented both the cruise companies and, most recently, cruise crew members. He said the situation facing crews now is rooted in the cruise industry’s avoidance of US governance. Even though the largest cruise lines are headquartered in the US and serve largely American clientele, they avoid US labour law and other regulation by registering outside the US and sailing their ships under foreign flags. “These crew members are like refugees now. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place,” he said. “The cruise lines think they can do anything they want with these folks and not treat them like human beings and not get them back to their homes.”"
"Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry’s possible role in spreading the disease around the planet. In a statement on Monday, the operator said eight cruise ships would resume operations from 1 August, sailing from Galveston, Texas, and Miami and Port Canaveral in Florida, once a no-sail order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had expired. The CDC has issued repeated warnings that cruise travel has spread the coronavirus outbreak around the world and on Friday, the US Congress announced an investigation of Carnival Cruise Line’s parent company – Carnival Corporation – over why it did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff. In response to the announcement, the CDC said it had not discussed timelines for resuming cruise travel with any operators, adding “we do not have enough information to say when it will be safe for cruise ships to resume sailing”.  Dozens of people have died and more than 1,500 confirmed Covid-19 infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival’s ships, which saw major outbreaks on the Diamond Princess, the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess. Carnival Cruise Line said it was “committed to supporting all public health efforts to manage the Covid-19 situation” in the statement to customers and travel agents announcing a limited resumption of its North America operations. “We are taking a measured approach, focusing our return to service on a select number of homeports where we have more significant operations that are easily accessible by car for the majority of our guests,” it continued. The CDC no-sail order was first issued on 14 March amid rising concerns about how “cruise ship travel may continue to introduce, transmit, or spread Covid-19”. The order was extended for 100 days on 15 April until 24 July, prohibiting travel until Covid-19 is no longer a public health emergency or the CDC modifies the order based on specific public health advice. Alongside the announcement to resume operations, Carnival Cruise Line said it had cancelled all of its trips in July and extended the “pause” operations in all other North American and Australian markets until the end of August. “We will use this additional time to continue to engage experts, government officials and stakeholders on additional protocols and procedures to protect the health and safety of our guests, crew and the communities we serve,” the statement continued. In a statement, the CDC said it “is closely monitoring the situation on cruise ships while we review the cruise lines’ plans to prevent, detect, contain and respond to Covid-19 during the no-sail period. “CDC will continue to work with cruise lines to ensure all necessary public health procedures are in place when cruise lines do begin regular sailing. CDC has not consulted with any of the cruise lines on timelines for resuming cruise travel for passengers.”"
"My friend Mohamed Hyder, who has died aged 88, was a professor of zoology in Kenya who was also a leading figure in the management of the country’s national parks. Mo was the first African to chair the board of trustees of Kenya National Parks – serving from 1964 to 1967 and again from 1970 to 1974 – and he established Mpunguti marine park and reserve, an important habitat for marine wildlife, in 1978. In addition to his academic work as a professor at the University of Nairobi, he took many roles in conservation, and led the Kenya delegation to the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1966. Born in Mombasa, the son of Fatma Sood and her husband, Hyder Kindy, who was a leading figure in local politics, Mohamed went to school in Mombasa, and then studied at Makerere University College in Uganda between 1950 and 1953. In 1954 he spent a year at Chelsea College of Science and Technology in London, before enrolling at St Andrews University. He graduated with first-class honours in biology in 1959, and in 1962 obtained a PhD from the University of Leeds, after which he returned to east Africa.  In Kenya he held a Nuffield research fellowship at Makerere University (1962-63), before joining what was to become the University of Nairobi as a lecturer in zoology in 1963. He served the university until his retirement in 1990 and was given a personal professorship in zoology – the first in east Africa – in 1970, and was professor of zoology from 1971.  Mo also played a large role in the Muslim community of Kenya, and served as chairman of the country’s Muslim Civic Education Trust from 1999, in which role he was respected for his wisdom and kindness. I first met Mo in 1971 through my work for the Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas, and he and his wife, Samira, whom he married in 1955, became close friends. They were always generous in their hospitality. Whenever I visited Kenya, Mo would meet me at the airport and tell me to which park he was taking me. In this way I was privileged to see most of Kenya’s national parks. He is survived by Samira, six children and 26 grandchildren."
"Green economy recovery packages for the coronavirus crisis will repair the global economy and put the world on track to tackle climate breakdown, but time is running out to implement the changes needed, new analysis has shown. Projects which cut greenhouse gas emissions as well as stimulating economic growth deliver higher returns on government spending, in the short term and in the longer term, than conventional stimulus spending, the study from Oxford University found. Many of the projects that could create new jobs in the UK are “shovel-ready”, compliant with social distancing requirements and could be started quickly, said Cameron Hepburn, director of the Smith School of enterprise and the environment at Oxford University and lead author of the study. He cited energy efficiency programmes to insulate the UK’s draughty housing stock, the building of electric vehicle charging networks, redesigning roads for more cycling, flood protection and planting trees. “These all need large-scale deployment, offer low to moderate skilled work and will have benefits in terms of climate change as well as boosting the economy,” he said. The Oxford study compared green stimulus projects with traditional stimulus, such as measures taken after the 2008 global financial crisis, and found green projects create more jobs, deliver higher short-term returns per pound spent by the government, and lead to increased long-term cost savings. Clean energy infrastructure construction is one example, generating twice as many jobs per pound of government expenditure as fossil fuel projects around the world. Others include expanding broadband so more people can work from home. “Tackling climate change has the answer to our economic problems,” Prof Hepburn told the Guardian. In their stimulus packages after the 2008 financial crisis, governments largely failed to capitalise on the carbon-cutting potential of their spending, partly because there was a lack of “shovel-ready” initiatives. This time, countries already have commitments to cut emissions under the Paris agreement, so there is a framework to require them to take account of carbon, as well as better awareness of the economic benefits of renewable energy, electric vehicles and other clean technology. “I think there is a better chance this time of a green recovery,” he said. The findings of the study, published in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, provide academic backing to the calls for a “green recovery” that have been made by leading experts amid the Covid-19 crisis. The study also supports calls for any bailouts for fossil fuel companies or heavy emitting sectors, such as airlines and car manufacturing, to have conditions attached that would require the companies to reduce their climate impact. Brian O’Callaghan, also of the Smith School and co-author of the paper, said governments should act quickly. “Following large-scale government spending, there is often a hesitancy on the part of the public to spend more,” he said. “The natural inclination might be to take an easy pathway. But this is the single biggest opportunity for the government to shape the future decade, and it could give a significant economic boost.” The paper, co-authored by the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, and Lord Nicholas Stern, the climate economist, catalogues more than 700 stimulus policies and makes comparisons with the global financial crisis of 2008. More than 230 experts, including senior officials from finance ministries and central banks in 53 countries, responded to a survey on the potential for climate benefits and fiscal recovery measures. Stern warned last week at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue where the UK, the US, China and other governments discussed the climate crisis, that stimulating new jobs in heavily emitting sectors was short-sighted. “The jobs of the past are insecure jobs,” he said. “[To create future jobs] we need the right kind of finance in the right place at the right scale at the right price.” Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and now a finance adviser to Boris Johnson for Cop26, called for all companies to disclose their plans to reach net zero emissions. “Every company in every sector, every bank and every insurer, every pension fund, should be expecting to develop and disclose a transition plan to net zero,” he said. The UK can seize the opportunity as president and host of the crunch UN climate talks to lead the way on an international green recovery, leading economists said, in a briefing to ministers to accompany the Oxford study results. The Cop26 summit has been postponed to early next year, giving time for the government to come up with a recovery package that would set the UK on a path to net zero emissions. The economists called for a new climate emergency committee, led by ministers, and for the UK to set up a sustainable recovery alliance with other governments. “The UK should link Cop26 with the Covid-19 recovery,” said O’Callaghan. “They have a real leadership opportunity.” Emily Shuckburgh, of the University of Cambridge, a co-author of the government briefing, said: “Shaping the national and global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in a way that supports the response to climate change and other environmental threats simply makes sense. Not only does analysis suggest green recovery packages deliver greater economic benefit, but investing appropriately in research, innovation, infrastructure and skills training, and matching that with robust institutional structures, will help create a fairer, more resilient, sustainable world with benefits for all.”"
"After an ill-fated Antarctic expedition in which 60% of passengers and crew contracted coronavirus and spent a month stranded off the coast of South America, the successful repatriation of 132 tourists from a Australian cruise ship seemed like a rare happy ending. But what should have been a peaceful epilogue in which the crew of the Greg Mortimer sailed safely home has become a gruesome sequel of sickness and panic – with the added possibility of a legal battle in Miami courts. In recent days, tensions onboard the stranded ship reached a breaking point over allegations that the ship’s operators and captain pressured the chief medical officer to mislead authorities in Uruguay about the health situation onboard. Emails seen by the Guardian appear to show that two companies associated with the Greg Mortimer – Miami-based crewing company CMI/Sunstone and the Australian cruise operator Aurora Expeditions – urged Dr Mauricio Usme to downplay the severity of the outbreak. A doctor from a third company linked to the vessel – the Fort Lauderdale medical company Vikand – also allegedly suggested Usme should play down the health situation onboard. The ship remains anchored 20km off the coast of Uruguay. Thirty-three members of its 85-strong crew – including Dr Usme – have tested positive for coronavirus, and one has died of Covid-19. “More will continue getting sick,” Usme told the Guardian over a tenuous WhatsApp connection. “We’re all exposed to the risk of potential death as long as we remain onboard, because having coronavirus is like having a timebomb ticking inside you that could go off at any moment.” Usme and eight other crew members have retained the services of Miami maritime lawyer Louis Vucci. “At some point there could be legal action for them getting Covid unnecessarily,” Vucci told the Guardian. The Greg Mortimer set out from the Argentinian port of Ushuaia on 15 March – four days after the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared an international pandemic. After a week at sea, coronavirus symptoms were detected, but by then, Argentina had closed its ports to cruise ships, so the Greg Mortimer changed course to Uruguay. As they neared Montevideo, Usme completed a maritime declaration of health – a standard form reporting the possible existence of infectious disease onboard. Usme had already divided the ship into red, grey and yellow zones, for passengers in isolation, quarantine or observation. “We didn’t have test kits onboard, so I had to assume that anybody with symptoms was positive.” In his health declaration for Montevideo, Usme stated: “We have patients with fever we need to rule out with specific test Covid-19/Sars2.” But before submitting the declaration, Usme received emails from CMI/Sunstone and Aurora Expeditions, apparently urging him to change his answers.“The risk we carry is public outcry and wharf side workers refusing to allow the ship to berth and allow passengers to disembark,” wrote Aurora director Glenn Haifer in an email dated 26 March. “Please bear in mind that how you write the health declaration will influence the way that this is viewed. We don’t know we have Covid-19.” Haifer added: “Give limited information truthfully.”Usme replied: “For ethics, for morality, for responsibility with ourselves and with the health of those who are not affected, the health declaration must reflect the reality that we currently have.” A spokesman for Aurora said: “We strongly disagree with the characterisation of the situation, but understanding that legal action has commenced between various other parties, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.’’ The email from CMI argued that Usme should change his answer to a question about quarantine as the ship had not officially been put under quarantine. A spokesman for CMI denied that any pressure was put on Usme, saying: “The doctor was asked to accurately and truthfully complete the health declaration form.” The spokesman added that CMI and the vessel worked closely with the Uruguayan authorities on every aspect of the vessel’s arrival. “This was done with full and complete transparency at every step,” he said. But at least two other crew members claimed pressure was brought to bear on the medical officer. An audio recording heard by the Guardian suggests that, as the ship approached Montevideo, the ship’s Swedish captain, Joachim Säterskog, offered to change the doctor’s declaration, as the ship had not been placed under quarantine by authorities. “The company wanted to disembark the passengers, which was very irresponsible because they would have represented a great risk for Uruguay,” ship storekeeper Marvin Paz Medina told the Guardian in a WhatsApp message. Usme refused to reconsider and the unaltered declaration was sent to port authorities on 28 March – with the result that Uruguay did not allow the Greg Mortimer to disembark. It was not until 11 April that a “sanitary corridor” was established for the first group of passengers to fly home to Australia, with a second flight leaving for the US a few days later.Crew members maintain that the ship’s managers endangered passengers and crew by persisting with the cruise despite the WHO declaration of a pandemic. “We were convinced that, in light of the international pandemic alert already in place by then, this trip would be cancelled,” the ship’s security officer, Lukasz Zuterek, told the Guardian. Zuterek says he has been dismissed from duties and confined to his cabin, despite testing negative, after he recently spoke up against a plan by management to sail the ship to the Canary Islands. The crew remains in limbo. Uruguay will not let them disembark until they all test negative for more than 14 days.“We are very afraid, one of us already died, five others have been extremely ill,” said Paz Medina.Säterskog on Thursday sent a message to all crew members assuring them that none of them would be forced to sail across the Atlantic against their will. “We are staying in Montevideo to make sure the entire ship is tested negative or until we receive permission from local authorities to disembark crew when commercial flights are available again,” he wrote. Crew members, meanwhile, are demanding to be evacuated via special charter flights as the passengers were. Both CMI and Aurora said that the decision to set sail on 15 March was made “on the basis of the best information available to us at the time”, adding that no passengers or crew were suspected of having contracted coronavirus at the time of boarding. CMI also said that on the day the ship set sail, only two coronavirus cases had been confirmed in the entire province of Tierra del Fuego, which includes Ushuaia. “We were very aware of the globally evolving coronavirus situation and after deep consideration and having sought and received guidance from trusted and globally respected advisers, the decision was made to proceed. The safety and wellbeing of our passengers has always been paramount,” said a spokesperson for Aurora. “We understand the frustrations of crew in this unprecedented emergency and believe … that the real issue is the repatriation of our seafarers, truly essential workers around the globe, throughout the pandemic,” said a spokesperson for CMI. Vikand and Säterskog did not respond to a request for comment."
"A perfect storm appears to loom over any attempt to restore wildlife and environmental health to one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. British conservationists were already facing the loss of EU funding and environmental regulations after Brexit. Now, as a deep recession bites, conservation funding is likely to be further hit as donors and philanthropic funders channel money towards human health. During the austerity of the 2010s, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) suffered bigger cuts than any other department. Is there any reason to expect anything different this time around? Many environmentalists hope there is. The eight-week experience of lockdown has transformed public attitudes towards local green spaces, neighbourhood nature and wild species. Conservation charities are determined to mobilise this new interest. “We’re definitely in an unfrozen moment with being connected to nature,” said Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB. “There’s this shift from consumer to citizen and all that goes with that in terms of community, place and sense of where you fit in the natural world and the global world. There’s a real opportunity to open that door which is tremendously exciting.” In the short term, the RSPB (with 50% of its staff furloughed) must meet the challenge of opening up its nature reserves – an area the size of Suffolk. Car parks will open within the next two weeks but bird hides – where physical distancing is impossible – and many income-generating visitor centres will remain closed. NGOs such as the Wildlife Trusts, with its popular #30dayswild campaign in June, whereby people pledge to undertake “random acts of wildness” each day, are encouraging public engagement in nature by showing its physical and mental health benefits. This will be key to ensuring that nature is seen as relevant by policymakers as society adapts to the coronavirus world. “Nature conservation charities need to be part of the green recovery,” said Julie Williams, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation. “It’s vital charities are welcomed into a post-Covid-19 recovery programme fully funded by a government that grasps that interest in nature which people are discovering. Could we work in greater partnership with Public Health England and the NHS to help with that health and wellbeing agenda which will be so important as we start to recover?” Butterfly Conservation and the RSPB are also developing more projects to boost urban wildlife, while the very white conservation sector is acutely aware it needs to become more diverse to encourage a more widespread range of supporters. Transformed public appreciation for nature and green space may push government policy, but conservationists know their ability to reverse decades of biodiversity losses ultimately depends on funding. The impact of austerity, according to Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, is evident in cash-strapped government agencies such as Natural England and the Environment Agency. “Statutory agencies are no longer delivering even a minimally acceptable service,” said Shardlow. Although the government announced on Monday a £15m boost for Natural England this year, it will only make up a small amount of the cuts to the body over the past decade, during which funding dropped from £265m in 2008-2009 to a low of £86.5m in 2019-20.  Natural England is responsible for managing sites of special scientific interest. In 2010 the government pledged to ensure half of the SSSIs were in a “favourable” state for wildlife by 2020; that commitment has been quietly dropped, with just 39% in that state. The key, says Shardlow, is to ensure the countryside is restored so it can perform ecological functions again – prevent flooding, for instance, and become rich once more in pollinators and other insects that provide natural pest control. The most cost-effective method is wildlife corridors so species can move through the landscape when challenged by climate change. Even in a deep recession, there is money. Under the EU, British farming received £3.4bn each year. The post-Brexit farm subsidy, the Environmental Land Management scheme, is still being developed. If reality matches its vision – public money not for unsustainable farming practices but for public goods, such as preventing flooding, improving soils or boosting biodiversity – nature conservation could be transformed. “A lot of the £3.4bn does need to go to biodiversity and the environment,” said Shardlow, who hopes that the new public mood will be matched by increased determination within Defra to resist further cuts. “Defra were very compliant last time,” said Shardlow. “I hope they’ve learned their lesson.”"
"The improvement in air quality over the past month of the coronavirus lockdown has led to 11,000 fewer deaths from pollution in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, a study has revealed. Sharp falls in road traffic and industrial emissions have also resulted in 1.3m fewer days of work absence, 6,000 fewer children developing asthma, 1,900 avoided emergency room visits and 600 fewer preterm births, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. While the pandemic continues to take a terrible toll – more than 220,000 deaths worldwide since the start of the year – the authors of the report say the response has offered a glimpse of the cleaner, healthier environment that is possible if the world shifts away from polluting fossil fuel industries. Compared with the same period last year, levels of nitrogen dioxide have fallen by 40% while tiny particulate matter – known as PM2.5 – is down 10%, which means that people without Covid-19 can breathe easier. These two forms of pollution, which weaken the heart and respiratory system, are together normally responsible for about 470,000 deaths in Europe each year. The new research estimates how this is likely to have fallen using statistical models that combine data for air quality, weather conditions, emissions, population and disease prevalence. They found the highest number of avoided pollution deaths in Germany (2,083), followed by the UK (1,752), Italy (1,490), France (1,230) and Spain (1,083). By disease, almost 40% of the fatality reductions were related to heart failure, 17% from lung ailments such as bronchitis and emphysema, and 13% each from strokes and cancer. The others were infections and diabetes. The overall calculation of 11,000 avoided deaths is the most likely estimate from a series of computer analyses with results ranging as high as 20,000 and as low as 7,000. Worldwide, the number of avoided pollution deaths will be much higher because this study focuses on one continent and one month, rather than going back to the start of the global pandemic in Wuhan six months ago. The world’s two most populous and polluted nations – China and India – have experienced some of the sharpest falls in air pollution. The study does not include deaths from coronavirus itself. Scientists believe air pollution increases the malignancy of the disease and some studies suggest the virus can attach to particulate matter, but the researchers behind the latest model said they did not have sufficient data to include this in their models. The lead author of the analysis, Lauri Myllyvirta, said the fall in air pollution had reduced pressure on health services at an important time and shown how much of a difference air quality improvements can make. But he was wary of framing this as a benefit. “I am very conflicted about all of this. People are dying. The measures we have been forced to take are causing a lot of economic and other distress, but this is an unprecedented experiment in reducing fossil fuel consumption so of course people working on air pollution are paying attention,” he said. “We have a lot of global crises to face. I hope this will make people think: ‘What if we had this sort of air quality not because everyone is forced to sit at home but because we managed the shift to clean transport and energy?’ We have to hope this virus helps us to move forward in fighting climate change and other bigger challenges, rather than taking us back.” Health experts said the findings echoed their experience during the pandemic. “We have seen many fewer patients admitted with exacerbations of asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] over the last month and there is no doubt that a fall in air pollution is part of the reason,” said Dr LJ Smith, a consultant in respiratory medicine at King’s College hospital in London. “It’s allowed us to question what we have previously accepted as normal. If air pollution returns to its previous levels my waiting room will once again start filling up with children and adults struggling to breathe.”"
"Claims that environmental regulations have risen “by 445%” are based on a flawed word-counting methodology developed at a US conservative thinktank and should not be relied upon, legal experts have told Guardian Australia. Last week the Melbourne-based libertarian thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs claimed its analysis showed that since 2000 regulations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act had increased by 10% a year. The methodology used for the IPA’s analysis was developed at the US-based thinktank the Mercatus Center, linked to the powerful billionaire industrialist and Republican donor Charles Koch. But experts who spoke to Guardian Australia have dismissed the methodology – known as RegData – as fundamentally flawed and ideologically motivated. Prof Jodi Short, of the University of California’s Hastings law school, is a critic of “regulation counting” efforts. She told Guardian Australia: “RegData is a political project that seeks to reduce regulation, period. “It is not an effort to improve the quality of regulation or maximise the net benefits of regulation, it is an effort to stop regulators in their tracks, regardless of the costs to the economy, the environment, and to human health and safety.” RegData counts key words and phrases in legislation – “shall”, “must”, “may not”, “prohibited” and “required” – as a supposed measure of the levels of regulation. The IPA released its analysis last week amid reports that the environment minister, Sussan Ley, was planning to cut “green tape” and could make changes to Australia’s centrepiece environmental law before a review, due to be completed in October. The IPA analysis, which has received uncritical coverage in some media outlets, has been submitted to the review of the EPBC Act. Brendan Sydes, an environmental lawyer and the chief executive of Environmental Justice Australia, told Guardian Australia: “I think it is clear that this is an attempt to import to Australia a spurious methodology developed by rightwing thinktanks in the United States. “They are ideologically opposed to consumer protection and environmental protections laws, and that is their starting point for this analysis.” Sydes said Prof Graeme Samuel, the former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chair who is chairing the review of the EPBC Act, should reject the IPA’s analysis. “We should be focused on environmental outcomes that the act is meant to achieve. Just counting types of words tells us little about the legislation and if it’s efficient.” He said Australia’s environmental laws were “failing to protect Australia’s unique places and wildlife”. “The EPBC Act needs to focus on this, rather on those that seek to strip away environmental laws.” In a 2018 critique of RegData, Short wrote: “Regulation counts do not account for the weight of the things counted. This is a fundamental flaw if regulation counts are meant to measure regulatory costs, burdens, or constraints on regulated entities. “The burden of carrying 1,000 feathers is very different from the burden of carrying 1,000 anvils, yet regulation counts make no attempt to differentiate between regulatory feathers and anvils.” Short told Guardian Australia that RegData “creates a powerful political narrative about the volume of regulation crushing the populace, undermining political support for regulation”. She said RegData forced regulators into examining “the mundane but extraordinarily time consuming task of regulation accounting” instead of “developing quality regulations that protect public health, safety, economic wellbeing, and the environment”. “For people who purport to shun red tape, Mercatus has been highly adept at tying regulators’ hands with it,” she said. Mercatus and the IPA say cutting regulations will be good for the economy, but Short said: “There is no credible empirical evidence that they are causally related (or even correlated with) the economic outcomes that Mercatus claims.” She added: “I am, frankly, shocked that Mercatus and its political allies continue to forge ahead with their agenda to hobble effective regulation.” Chris McGrath, a barrister and environmental law expert, told Guardian Australia: “The whole idea of just counting key words to track a rise in environmental regulation, as RegData does, then saying, ‘That’s bad and it should go back to the starting level,’ is a fallacy. “In reviewing any law, you need to look at the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of the law in the context of the nature of the complex problems they are trying to address. That’s a hard task and one that the RegData approach avoids doing. The RegData analysis is fundamentally lazy.” Prof Jason Potts, of Melbourne’s RMIT University, worked to develop the Australian version of RegData that was used by the IPA. “Disputes between academics are normal,” he said. “There is a vibrant academic debate related to the measurement of regulation, and we have contributed to that in top peer-reviewed journals developing an innovative empirical methodology.” He said the RegData methodology had been published in “top US academic journals”, adding: “We are certainly proud to be working with top US university researchers.” He said one way economists studied the effects of law was to have a “quantitative measure of regulation at a point in time and for a jurisdiction”. Patrick McLaughlin, a senior fellow at Mercatus Center who devised RegData, said it “was a way to measure, like a scale” and that it provided a “useful number”. He said “hundreds of third-party academics” had used it. It was “utter nonsense” to claim it was a “political project”, he said: “RegData is a significant improvement in the science of regulation. You would only make this argument if you don’t think science can lead to improvement.” An IPA spokesman also rejected the claim that RegData was ideologically driven. The thinktank’s director of research, Daniel Wild, said RegData was a “revolutionary approach to measuring and cutting red tape” and could be “used to measure the red tape burden, track government progress in reducing red tape, compare the regulatory burden across industries and across states and identify areas of prioritisation for governments”. The Mercatus Center is based at George Mason University’s Arlington campus. It says it “advances knowledge about how markets work to improve people’s lives”. According to its website, it is a not-for-profit organisation “supported by foundations (58%), individuals (40%), and businesses (2%) from around the country”. Charles Koch, with his late brother David, donated many millions to a network of libertarian and conservative thinkthanks, including those that have challenged the science and risks of human-caused climate change. One counting of financial disclosures shows that the Charles Koch Foundation donated more than $9m to the Mercatus Center between 2002 and 2012. Koch is an emeritus board member at Mercatus, and was listed as a director in financial disclosures for 2018, the most recent year available. The Mercatus Center was founded by Richard Fink, a former executive at Koch Industries. Koch’s contributions to Mercatus, and to George Mason University, as well as many other universities, have sparked protests and campaigns around the US. Samantha Parsons, director of campaigns at UnKoch My Campus, told Guardian Australia: “The only difference between the Mercatus Center and another industry-funded think-tank is the fact that GMU allows the Center to use its name and office space to brand itself as an academic program, and that’s exactly what UnKoch is fighting.” Another environmental law expert, adjunct Prof Rob Fowler, of the University of South Australia, said RegData Australia’s “use of simplistic counting measures based on certain key words to measure the volume or extent of regulation does not provide any useful evidence as to the effectiveness or, alternatively, the dis-benefits of particular regulatory measures”. He added: “I believe it is simply catering to a neoliberal, anti-regulatory ideology and audience by providing numerical data to present an attempted quantitative assessment of an inherently qualitative subject.” The methodology’s ties to the Kochs “speaks powerfully to the real, political motives behind its development”, he said."
"The RSPB has been “overrun” with reports of birds of prey being illegally killed since lockdown began. Police have been called out to investigate multiple cases of raptors being shot, trapped or suspected of having been poisoned, with the charity saying most incidents were on or close to sporting estates managed for game bird shooting. The RSPB has logged at least 56 potential offences – more than one a day on average – since lockdown began on 23 March, including 15 confirmed shot birds of prey and 24 birds submitted for further postmortem analysis after suspected illegal killing. Birds targeted in the last six weeks include hen harriers, peregrine falcons, red kites, goshawks, buzzards and a barn owl. On 29 March, a buzzard was found with its wing fractured by gunshot at Shipton, near York. The buzzard was rehabilitated by a local wildlife expert and recovered. Over the Easter weekend, a red kite was found shot dead near Leeds with 12 shotgun pellets in its body. The following weekend, the naturalist and broadcaster Iolo Williams recovered a red kite in Powys which had been shot dead. Two further red kites were also reported shot in the area. In Scotland, the police are investigating several raptor persecution cases and reports of the use of illegal traps on grouse moors. Mark Thomas, head of UK investigations for the RSPB, said: “Since lockdown began, the RSPB has been overrun with reports of birds of prey being targeted. It is clear that criminals on some sporting estates, both in the uplands and lowlands, have used the wider closure of the countryside as an opportunity to ramp up their efforts to kill birds of prey. “Spring is the time when birds of prey are most visible and therefore vulnerable, as they put on courtship displays, build nests and find food ready to breed. The criminal actions are targeted and malicious in nature, taking out birds before they have the opportunity to breed, often in areas where they have previously faced persecution.” Supt Nick Lyall, the head of a national police and policy group tasked with tackling raptor persecution, said he was “sickened” by the number of cases in recent weeks. “Lockdown has been seen as a green light by those involved in raptor persecution offences to continue committing crimes, presumably in the belief that there are fewer people around to catch them doing so,” he said. “I remain grateful to everyone involved in investigating these crimes, and thankfully in the vast majority of the cases I am aware of, it looks like some really good lines of inquiry are taking place which should lead to arrests and interviews.” Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, said: “Any confirmed reports of raptor persecution are cause for concern. The incidents specified near Leeds and York ... [by the RSPB] are clearly not on grouse moors, while reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public. Estates across the country have reported a number of raptors including peregrine, merlin and hen harriers nesting and living on those landscapes. “We condemn any illegal activity and Moorland Association members have signed up to a cross-sector zero tolerance approach to wildlife crime.” Dr Ruth Tingay of Raptor Persecution UK and co-founder of Wild Justice, said: “The reported surge really shouldn’t come as any surprise. Birds of prey have been ruthlessly targeted on many game-shooting estates for decades; lockdown simply provides the criminals with more opportunity to pursue their targets with little fear of detection or consequence. “The big question remains the same – lockdown or not: when will this government acknowledge the scale and extent of the problem and hold these shooting estates to account? Wilful blindness can no longer be tolerated.”"
"Most days, from our vantage point of 500 feet, we can gaze east across an expanse of dissected pastoral land, towards cloud shadows passing over the pale slopes of western Dartmoor. The remarkably clear atmosphere of recent weeks has even allowed glimpses of china clay country on the southern flanks of the moor, where whiteness skims the horizon of Crownhill Downs. Beyond foreshortened views of suburbs at Roborough, and the Plym Valley, peeps a hazy knoll of trees (probably on Hemerdon Ball); it reminds of freer times, of travelling away on the train from Plymouth, initially up the incline of Hemerdon Bank. Much closer, just four miles away, steep shadowy woods of Morwell and Maddacleave mark the Devon bank of the Tamar, but the meandering river is out of sight, below the prominent mine-stack of Gawton and pinnacles on Calstock’s church tower. Further downriver, around Bere Alston, diverse shades of green indicate cereal crops, pastureland and grass already cut for hay or silage; a few fields near Helston Farm stand out with pinkish-brown earth, still unsown. Less than two miles from our lookout, maize emerges through shiny plastic covering an enclave near Metherell. Adjoining bosky ground, of small fields enclosed by hedges topped with hedgerow trees, conceals mine relics on the fringes of Hingston Down, and new houses, under construction along the main road through St Ann’s Chapel.  Where we stand, near the landmark clump of beech, blue speedwell creeps across the crunchy remnants of mast. Further out in the field, flowering sweet vernal, plantain, creeping buttercup and dandelion clocks remain stunted after the dry spring, but some red clover scatters across the scant pasture. Old hedge-banks that were regularly shorn and topped until 10 years ago regenerate as linear bushy woodland. Bluebell, campion, stitchwort, ferns, pennywort and foxglove colonise the rabbit-burrowed footings, but are less prolific than on the outer sides, along lanes shielded from chemical sprays and fertilisers used on arable crops once grown within the field. Today, jackdaws peck about in scuffed earth. South from here, the farmer who is turning an early crop of hay reports sight of two kites circling high above him, unfazed by the harassing crows."
"Outbreaks of Covid-19 at slaughterhouses are occurring in a number of countries around the world, in a development that may have long-term implications for food supply systems, say experts. The US has been hardest hit, with outbreaks at more than 180 meat and processed food plants. But other countries with highly consolidated meat supply chains – Ireland, Spain, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Canada and the UK – are also struggling. “Workers are having to go back to work, and farmers are having to euthanise their animals,” said Ben Lilliston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. “It’s a very chaotic, crazy situation.”  The reasons for the outbreaks are said to be a combination of  crowded working conditions, workforces that are often made up predominantly of migrant workers living in communal housing, and the fact that plants have remained open during the crisis. The problem is particularly acute where large companies dominate the industry, as has increasingly been the case. Many small slaughterhouses have been shut down over recent years in favour of fewer but larger plants that may have thousands of workers, leading to what one observer called “the most narrow bottleneck in US agribusiness”. In the short term, the issue is causing instability in the supply chain, with panic buying of meat in the US and the euthanisation of millions of farm animals. Questions are being asked about the risks to workers of infection and even death. In the long term, the problems will raise questions about stability and lack of resilience in the current system, which is dominated by a handful of vast international companies including Cargill, JBS, Smithfield and Tyson. In the US there have been almost 5,000 cases and at least 20 deaths among meat plant workers as of the end of April. The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting says there have now been more than 10,000 cases linked to meat plants. Difficulties with physical distancing and hygiene, and crowded living and transportation conditions, are listed as potential risk factors by US health officials.  More than 20 meat plants have been closed  in recent weeks, and one outbreak alone – at the Smithfield pork plant in South Dakota – saw more than 850 confirmed cases. Workers may have continued to work while feeling ill due to economic insecurity, health officials said. Tyson poultry workers were being offered a $500 bonus to continue working. In Germany there have been more than 300 confirmed cases at the Müller Fleisch plant in Birkenfeld. The owners called it the “most serious crisis” in the plant’s history. The communal living spaces for the largely migrant workforce have been partially blamed. In Canada, 949 cases have been confirmed at an Alberta meat packing house owned by Cargill, in the largest outbreak linked to a single facility in the country. In Australia, approximately 70 cases have so far been confirmed at Cedar Meats in Melbourne, which has been shut down for deep cleaning. Prosecutors in Brazil are currently trying to close down plants – including some run by JBS and BRF – where cases have been detected. Cases have been confirmed at nine plants, according to a government report seen by Reuters, which stated that more than 16,000 people may have been exposed. In Spain, there has been a row at Litera Meat in Binéfar, Aragon, about the number of workers who have the virus. Initial serological tests were positive for about 200 workers. The management have carried out subsequent tests on 284 workers to see if they are currently carrying the virus and had 11 positive results.   Plants in Ireland have also been hit hard. Official figures show outbreaks at ten plants with more than 560 workers affected. Outbreaks were reported at Liffey Meats in Cavan and Kepak plants in Roscommon and Longford. More than a third of the workforce – 120 workers in all – at the Rosderra pigmeat plant in Co Tipperary reportedly tested positive for the virus, while last Friday Dawn Meats closed its plant in Westmeath following positive cases. “We are seeing the results of years of meat industry consolidation and vertical integration aimed at increasing profits through efficiency and low wages,” Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies and global health at New York University told the Guardian, “regardless of effects on animals, workers, and the environment. Covid-19 reveals the costs to workers crowded together under already dangerous working conditions in jobs that often lacked sick leave and healthcare benefits. These are all problems dating from the early 1980s when the shareholder value movement forced corporations to have profit as their sole goal.” “I think it’s woken up a lot of people about how consolidated this system is, and how it is not very resilient, it’s really vulnerable,” said Lilliston. “People asking about food security in the US is kind of new. There is also a greater awareness of worker rights - the lack of power, working tightly packed together, the lack of government enforcement and inspection. I think there is going to be some fallout but whether action will be taken remains to be seen.” “It is clear that centralisation of processes into fewer and fewer centres, coupled with just-in-time supply chains, leads to a lack of resilience,” said Prof Tim Benton, research director for emerging risks at Chatham House, a London thinktank. “It’s not so easy to draft in a slaughterman off the street than to pull in casual labour into supermarkets or even farming.” The Guardian contacted all the companies named above. Cargill, JBS, Tyson and BRF detailed the significant work they are doing to deal with these issues including, in the case of JBS, working with physicians specialising in infectious diseases to develop a protocol, and, in the case of BRF, working with a global consultancy that specialises in risk management. Tyson has put aside $120m to give its workers “thank you bonuses”. All four said that they are carrying out special measures in their plants to protect workers, including distancing, staggered breaks, keeping vulnerable workers home and distributing face masks. Cargill pointed out: “We are also sensitive that farmers and ranchers need a place to move their cattle. This is a difficult balancing act facing our entire industry … We recognise farmers and ranchers rely on the global food system to earn their livelihoods, so it is critical we keep the market moving – for the farm economy and for the people and animals who rely on us for their food and nourishment.” Litera Meats told the Guardian it is focused on keeping workers safe, and that “good sense, caution, collaboration and understanding” are the principles guiding the response. Liffey Meats said that the health and safety of workers was its priority. "
"The federal agency providing oversight of the commercial nuclear sector is attempting to push through a rule change critics say could allow dangerous amounts of radioactive material to be disposed of in places like municipal landfills, with potentially serious consequences to human health and the environment. “This would be the most massive deregulation of radioactive waste in American history,” said Dan Hirsch, president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a nuclear industry watchdog non-profit, about a proposal that would permit “very low-level” radioactive waste to be disposed of by “land burial”. Currently, low-level radioactive waste is primarily disposed of in highly regulated sites in Texas, Washington, South Carolina and Utah. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) also provides exemptions allowing “low-level waste” to be dumped in unlicensed disposal sites, but these exemptions are given only rarely, and are conducted with strict case-by-case protocols in place. The proposed “interpretive” rule change relaxes the rules surrounding how radioactive materials would be disposed of in unlicensed disposal sites “significantly”, said Hirsch. “If you dump radioactive waste in places that aren’t designed to deal with it, it comes back to haunt you. It’s in the air you breathe, the food that you eat, the water you drink,” he added. In an email, David McIntyre, an NRC spokesperson, explained that the rule would apply only to a “small subset” of very low-level waste, and that the agency would not allow such disposals “if we felt public health and safety and the environment would not be protected”. But major sticking point, say experts, concerns how the term “very low-level waste” is not defined by statute or in the NRC’s own regulations. The NRC describes low-level wastes as contaminated materials like clothing, tools, and medical equipment. According to McIntyre, the radioactivity of “very low-level waste” is just above background. “The radioactivity level of very low-level waste is so low that it may be safely disposed of in hazardous or municipal solid waste landfills,” he wrote. Nevertheless, “background doesn’t mean it’s safe,” said Diane D’Arrigo, radioactive waste project director for the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, who added that the interpretive rule’s loose language “opens the floodgates” for nuclear waste to be disposed of “as if not radioactive”. The proposal caps the maximum annual “cumulative dose” to a person from the radioactive wastes dumped into unlicensed sites to 25 millirems – the same limit the NRC uses for highly regulated waste disposal sites. That measurement, said D’Arrigo, is a “projected” amount that can be manipulated through modeling. Experts point out that the nuclear industry has long sought cheaper ways to dispose of its wastes. As the nation’s fleet of nuclear power plants continues to age, and as more of them approach retirement, some of the decommissioning funds set up to safely dismantle the reactors are proving inadequate. “The NRC regulations are in effect a cost-benefit analysis,” explained Rodney Ewing, a professor of nuclear security at Stanford University. “It’s been a common trend to look for waste streams that, if separated out, they could be disposed of in less expensive ways.” Some environmentalists fear the rule change will also disproportionately impact low-income, marginalized communities who are more likely than their wealthier neighbors to be situated near solid waste landfills. According to Caroline Reiser, nuclear energy legal fellow with the Natural Resources Defense Council, if the proposal is successfully passed, then the issue could end up in court. “Once it starts getting implemented, that’s when the real fights end up happening,” she said."
"Captain Wynn Gale – a fifth-generation Georgia shrimper – is on the side of the road on an April morning, selling shrimp at the same street corner where his dad sold shrimp. “How’s the pandemic treating you?” I ask. “Sales have dropped off by about two-thirds. No out-of-towners coming through on the I-95. No local traffic.” He sighs. “I’m going to tough it out. I can survive with what I’m selling. But that’s all I’m doing. Most shrimpers don’t have 401k retirement plans, you know?” Gale would rather be out on his boat, a 1953 trawler he had for nine years but recently sold to a man in North Carolina. “It made me good money, but I couldn’t find a crew! You just can’t find anyone who wants to work shrimp boats any more. Most of ’em are on drugs. Give ’em a check and they’re gone.” He has a small boat he can run himself now. In the past, shrimping was an admirable vocation. Gale first got out on a shrimp boat when he was 12. “Mama wouldn’t let me go any earlier, but from 12 years on out – every weekend I wasn’t in school or summer vacation I was on a shrimp boat.” He spent the next 20 years learning from his dad, who shrimped for 45 years. “What was an average day like?” I ask. “I’d leave about 4.30 in the morning and get to the dragging grounds about 6.30, maybe 7am. I’d put out in daylight, make three or four drags that day. The latest I’d be out would be 4pm,” he says. “Look,” he tells me. “What I’m doing right here, right now, selling shrimp on this corner – it sucks. It’s way better out there on the water. It’s where I’ve lived all my life. If I wasn’t in the ocean, I was in the river running trout lines and catching catfish, or fishing for shad in winter.” Americans eat more shrimp than ever – an average of 4.4lb per person – but not all of America’s shrimpers are thriving. Nearly 90% of America’s shrimp comes from overseas, farmed in Asia and Central America, where working conditions and meat quality can be repugnant. It is increasingly rare for fresh, wild-caught, chemical-free shrimp to reach an American consumer’s plate. Off the coast of Georgia, fishermen harvested about 2.61m lb of shrimp in 2019, a haul valued more than $11m. Shrimping is deeply ingrained in culture there, but Georgia’s fishermen are facing significant challenges: an ageing workforce, low prices per pound, climate change and black gill disease, leading many to wonder if the industry will survive. These days, depending on the season, Gale can get $3 to $5.50 per lb of shrimp. “Back in the 1980s and 1990s,” he says, “we were selling the same size shrimp for $8 a pound. We have good years – but most of the time we have bad years now.” Bryan Fluech, the associate marine extension director at Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant, uses the term “graying of the fleet” when talking about the future of shrimping in Georgia. “Shrimp are the Cheetos of the sea,” Fluech tells me. “Everything eats them. But people need to remember: that shrimp didn’t just show up in a Publix. “The decline of the shrimping industry has been death by a thousand cuts,” Fluech says. “The cost for maintaining a boat is up, and the boats are getting older. Sustainable fishing practices are expensive to implement. The younger generation doesn’t want to work on a shrimping vessel, and captains tell me they can’t find a reliable workforce. The cost of ice and fuel might rise, but the profit on shrimp doesn’t. Plus, our guys are competing with foreign markets.” “A lot has changed,” Gale tells me. “We’re losing our infrastructure. Lost our big block ice plant that had given ice since the 1940s. Can’t hardly find anybody to build nets any more.” Fluech professes enormous respect for the shrimpers still operating in Georgia’s waters. “Let me tell you – MacGyver [the TV adventurer hero] has nothing on Georgia shrimpers. They are so resourceful. You can’t just be a good shrimper any more. You’ve got to be a welder, a businessman and a direct marketer too.” “People love to say that they’re all about local food,” Fluech adds. “And you’ll see a shrimping boat on every tourism brochure, but commercial waterfronts have changed. People don’t like the look of a working dock. There’s only one left in Brunswick, which means the fishermen have to take those prices or go out on their own. We say we like authentic experiences, but we’re losing them.” You can see the old reverence for Georgia’s shrimpers in the Blessing of the Fleet ceremonies, which still happen along the coast in towns like Brunswick and Darien at the end of March, as the fleet readies itself for the season. Ships with beautiful names like the Lady Raven, Flying Cloud, Bernice II, Liberty Bell and Sundown arrive at the ceremony decorated with lights and streamers. A crowd gathers, and a minister – often waving a toilet brush spray-painted gold, and flanked by the Knights of Columbus – offers a blessing into the microphone. Shrimping is a dangerous vocation, after all, and every year there are injuries, drownings and boats that don’t return. This year’s ceremony was postponed due to the pandemic. The cancellation feels like the latest knock in a long and difficult fight. Once celebrated, many shrimpers feel vilified as they face mounting regulations aimed at preserving other species, like sea turtles. In the 1980s, before turtle excluder devices (TEDs) were prevalent, shrimp nets were responsible for more than 10,000 sea turtle deaths annually in the south-east. In 1989, when regulations tightened, shrimpers created a 500-boat blockade in the Gulf coast, raising skull and crossbones flags and even ramming Coast Guard ships. In Georgia, tension between scientists and fishermen is amplified by black gill disease, which affects a shrimp’s respiratory system. The shrimp’s immune response causes the visible blackening of the gills, and results in lethargy, potential death and sometimes the collapse of an entire fishery. Black gill is an expensive problem. In 2019, the commerce department distributed over $1m to commercial shrimpers and researchers because of the 2013 white shrimp fishery failure. Black gill is, however, more pervasive than ever. Gale reports that it’s starting earlier in the year, beginning in May instead of August, and continuing throughout fall. Though it has been around since the 1990s, researchers believe the disease is worsening with climate change. Climate change will continue to wreak further havoc on the industry – changing the salinity of the water, shifting the distribution of shrimp – female shrimp need colder water to spawn. Warmer winters appear to predict a smaller annual shrimp harvest, and may not kill the bacteria responsible for black gill. Keeping shrimp fisheries healthy, and livelihoods possible, requires intense collaboration between fishermen and scientists. Otherwise, foreign markets with cheap labor and unsustainable practices will take over the market share entirely. “We have to look for the cooperative path,” Fluech says, emphasizing how helpful it can be when shrimpers help with data collection and reporting. He currently works with five to eight shrimpers each season; the fishermen help report black gill using an online tracking app. One of the best historical examples of this cooperative path is fisherman Sinkey Boone, who hailed from a long line of shrimpers in Darien. Boone created the first turtle excluder device in the late 1960s, called the Georgia Jumper, which allowed turtles – an oxygen-breathing species – to escape trawler nets so they wouldn’t drown. Scientists and fishermen may seem at odds, but collaboration is possible, and perhaps imperative. “Me and the shrimpers may not agree on everything, but I respect the hell out of them,” says Fluech. Gale agrees with the saying that shrimpers never retire. “We fish till we fall out and die,” he says. “I’ve seen men fish right on until their 80s and 90s. I know an old man right now who’s got to be 85 and he outworks anybody I know – still climbs up in the rigging. Diabetic and still goes.” I hear stories about poisonous snakes tangled in anchor lines, boats on fire, near-sinkings, and a man in his 70s impaled by his own equipment who hardly survived, but broke out of the hospital to get back on his boat a few days later. “Once fishing’s in your blood, and you get used to it, you just don’t want to do anything else,” Gale says. “I’d still work for my daddy,” Gale tells me. “He just knew where the shrimp would be – it was absolutely amazing. He knew the tide cycles, what the weather meant. You could set your watch to it. Another fisherman could make that same pass and miss them.” In 1979, the government issued 1,471 commercial trawling licenses in Georgia – but only 253 in 2014. If the decline in Georgia’s shrimping continues, the ripple effect will be felt in the local economy, on dinner plates, during seasonal festivals, and on the horizon line, where many are used to seeing early morning trawlers. Frozen foreign shrimp and farmed shrimp – known as aquaculture – are the likely future. “Do I think there will always be shrimpers in Georgia?” Fluech asks me. “I hope so. You have to be an eternal optimist in this business.”"
"The removal of feral horses from the Australian Alps can resume after Parks Victoria won a legal challenge to its plans to manage the invasive species. The Australian Brumby Alliance had challenged plans to remove feral horses that have overrun the Bogong high plains and eastern Victorian Alps within the Australian Alps national parks. The federal court had been asked to consider whether removal of horses should have been referred to the federal environment minister because they were part of the cultural heritage of that region. On Friday the court ruled against the alliance and ordered it to pay Parks Victoria’s costs. The court’s judgment found removal of feral horses from the Bogong high plains and Eastern alps was unlikely “to have a significant impact on the National Heritage values of the Australian Alps”. Feral horses are a pest species that threaten native plants and animals by grazing, trampling vegetation and habitat, and damaging waterways. But there have been attempts to protect the “heritage value” of the horses, most notably from the New South Wales government, which last year introduced laws to protect Snowy Mountains brumbies for cultural reasons. A survey for the NSW and Victorian governments found the feral horse population in Australia’s alpine parks had more than doubled over five years, with conservationists blaming a lack of management of feral horses in NSW for the soaring numbers. In the aftermath of the bushfire crisis it has become more urgent to control feral pest populations, which pose an even greater threat to species after fire. The Victorian government had originally planned to trap and rehome horses where possible and to humanely euthanise those it could not rehome. It now plans to introduce ground shooting as one of its control measures. The parks have been burnt, and culling was already being used to manage feral pigs, deer and goats after the fires. In a statement on Friday afternoon, Parks Victoria said the legal action had meant the agency had been forced to suspend the majority of its work to control feral horse populations over the past 18 months. It said trapping and rehoming programs had been put on hold, making it difficult for the agency to reduce the damage horses were causing to “fragile wildlife, plants and habitats in the Victorian Alps”. Mark Norman, the chief conservation scientist of Parks Victoria, said the court’s decision was positive. “The Victorian alps is home to species that occur nowhere else in the world,” he said. “They’ve evolved over millions of years and they’re not adapted to the pressures of half-tonne hard-hooved animals such as horses and deer, which cause so much damage to vegetation, waterways and other habitats. Our native wildlife and plants need help - they have nowhere else to go.” Daniel McLaughlin, Parks Victoria’s regional director for northern Victoria, said the scale and impact of the fires had been unprecedented and governments and the community needed to “mobilise efforts” to protect what was left of important ecosystems. He said the agency was authorised to remove feral horses from areas where conservation was a high priority and this would include “targeted ground shooting of free-ranging feral horses to control ongoing environmental damage”. Jill Pickering, the president of the Australian Brumby Alliance, said the organisation would “continue fighting for the brumbies, their small populations Victoria’s Eastern Alps are an irreplaceable part of Australia’s cultural heritage”. “But today’s court decision puts the future of Victoria’s brumbies in the hands of Parks Victoria,” she said. “We may become the last generation that allowed the brumbies to be relegated into the history books.” Andrew Cox, the chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, said the court’s decision affirmed Parks Victoria’s responsibility to manage feral horse populations. “When implemented by professionally trained shooters, ground shooting offers a more humane approach to feral horse management for targeted groups of horses,” said Andrew Cox, the chief executive of the Invasive Species Council.  “Ground shooting can reduce the time to death and avoid undue stress on horses that may otherwise be trapped, handled and transported long distances.” Cox said NSW was still without a long-term plan to address “the growing numbers of feral horses in Kosciuszko national park”. “Bushfire emergency measures will begin in Kosciuszko at the end of May, but will only operate for a year, cover one part of the park and use a more limited range of control options,” he said. The Victorian National Parks Association said feral horses had caused great damage to the alps and rejected “the notion that alpine ‘brumbies’ should be protected as a special horse breed”. The association’s protection advocate, Phil Ingamells, said the moss beds and fens, which are high-altitude wetlands and peatlands listed as threatened under both Victorian and national environmental laws, were “especially vulnerable to trampling by horses, and any other hard hooved animals”. “Since the abolition of cattle grazing in the Alpine national park, these wetlands have been slowly recovering, only to be impacted now by a growing number of feral horses,” he said."
"Humanity’s “promiscuous treatment of nature” needs to change or there will be more deadly pandemics such as Covid-19, warn scientists who have analysed the link between viruses, wildlife and habitat destruction. Deforestation and other forms of land conversion are driving exotic species out of their evolutionary niches and into manmade environments, where they interact and breed new strains of disease, the experts say. Three-quarters of new or emerging diseases that infect humans originate in animals, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it is human activity that multiplies the risks of contagion. A growing body of research confirms that bats – the origin of Covid 19 – naturally host many viruses which they are more likely transfer to humans or animals if they live in or near human-disturbed ecosystems, such as recently cleared forests or swamps drained for farmland, mining projects or residential projects. In the wild, bats are less likely to transfer the viruses they host to other animals or come into contact with new pathogens because species tend to specialise within distinct and well-established habitats. But once land is converted to human use, the probability increases of contact and viruses jumping zoonotically from one species to another. As natural habitats shrink, wild animals concentrate in ever smaller territories or migrate to anthropogenic areas, such as homes, sheds and barns. This is particularly true of bats, which feed on the large number of insects drawn to lamplight or fruit in orchards. Two years ago, scientists predicted a new coronavirus would emerge from bats in Asia, partly because this was the area most affected by deforestation and other environmental pressures. One of the authors, Roger Frutos, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Montpellier, said multiple studies have confirmed the density and variety of bat-borne viruses is higher near human habitation. “Humans destroy the bats’ natural environment and then we offer them alternatives. Some adapt to an anthropomorphised environment, in which different species cross that would not cross in the wild,” he said. Habitat destruction is an essential condition for the proliferation of a new virus, he added, but it is only one of several factors. Bats also need to pass the disease on to humans. There is no evidence of this being done directly for coronaviruses. Until now there has been an intermediary – either a domesticated animal or a wild animal which humans came into contact with for food, trade, pets or medicine. In the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, it was a civet cat. In the Mers outbreak in the Middle East in 2012, it was a camel. Scientists are not yet certain of the animal for Covid-19, though Frutos said initial theories that a pangolin was the intermediary now seem less likely. In a soon-to-be-published paper in Frontiers in Medicine, Frutos and his co-authors argue the key to containing future epidemics is not to fear the wild, but to recognise that human activities are responsible for the emergence and propagation of the zoonosis. “The focus must be on these human activities because they can be properly organised,” notes the paper titled, the Conjunction of Events Leading to the Pandemic and Lessons to Learn for Future Threats. Scientists have detected about 3,200 different strains of coronavirus in bats. Most are harmless to humans, but two very closely related sarbecoviruses found in east Asia were responsible for Sars and Covid-19. The paper says future sarbecovirus emergence will certainly take place in east Asia, but epidemics of other new diseases could be triggered elsewhere. South America is a key area of concern due to the rapid clearance of the Amazon and other forests. Scientists in Brazil have found viral prevalence was 9.3% among bats near deforested sites, compared to 3.7% in pristine woodland. “With deforestation and land-use change, you open a door,” said Alessandra Nava, of the Manaus-based Biobank research centre. She said diseases were naturally diluted in the wild, but this broke down when humans rapidly disrupted the ecological balance. As a local example, she pointed to Lyme disease, which has spread to humans through capybaras. Some municipalities are culling the giant rodents to prevent contagion, but Nava said this was not necessary in pristine forests that still had jaguars. “You don’t find Lyme disease in areas with jaguars because they keep the capybara numbers in check,” she said. “The problem is when you put different species that aren’t naturally close to one another in the same environment. That allows virus mutations to jump to other species,” she said. “We have to think about how we treat wild animals and nature. Right now we deal with them far too promiscuously.” Her conclusions were echoed by Tierra Smiley Evans, an epidemiologist at the University of California who studies virus distributions in the rapidly degrading forests of Myanmar. She has found that endangered or threatened species are more likely to have viruses than animals at lower risk of habitat loss and hunting. She said the connection between environmental stress and human health had been made more apparent by Covid-19 pandemic. “I’m hopeful that one of the most positive things to come out of horrible tragedy will be the realisation that there is a link between how we treat the forest and our wellbeing,” she said. “It really impacts our health. It is not just a wildlife issue or an environmental issue.” To prevent future pandemics, the academics said international cooperation was needed to encourage monitoring and education at a local level so that virus outbreaks could be detected and contained at an early stage. Although this would be expensive, they said it would more economically efficient than waiting for an outbreak to become a pandemic, which forces the world into lockdown. They also emphasised that bat culls and bans on wet markets were likely to be ineffective and could prove counterproductive because bats play an important role in insect control and plant pollination. “Living safely with bats is what we should be focusing on, not eliminating them,” Evans said. Conservation groups have also urged greater protection of existing habitats. A recent Greenpeace report warned the Amazon could see the next spillover of zoonotic viruses because the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, is putting a higher priority on opening up the forest than protecting people’s health. “It’s unforgivable. His appetite for destruction is fuelling the current health crisis and will make future crises we face even worse,” Daniela Montalto, Greenpeace forests campaigner, said. “He must be stopped and forest protection prioritised. Without it, we will all pay the price.”"
" Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of mismanaged waste could be blowing ashore on the ocean breeze every year, according to scientists who have discovered microplastics in sea spray. The study, by researchers at the University of Strathclyde and the Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées at the University of Toulouse, found tiny plastic fragments in sea spray, suggesting they are being ejected by the sea in bubbles. The findings, published in the journal Plos One, cast doubt on the assumption that once in the ocean, plastic stays put, as well as on the widespread belief in the restorative power of sea breeze. Around 359m tons of plastic was manufactured globally in 2018, and some studies suggest as much as 10% of it ends up in the sea each year. Steve Allen, a PhD candidate at Strathclyde who co-led the study, said: “Sea breeze has traditionally been considered ‘clean air’ but this study shows surprising amounts of microplastic particles being carried by it. It appears that some plastic particles could be leaving the sea and entering the atmosphere along with sea salt, bacteria, viruses and algae.” The “bubble burst ejection” of particles in sea fog or spray, described by Allen as “like soda in a glass when it hits your nose”, is a well-known phenomenon. But the new study is the first time microplastics have been shown to be ejected from the ocean. “We keep putting millions of tonnes of plastic into the ocean every year,” said Allen. “This research shows that it is not going to stay there forever. The ocean is giving it back to us.” Plastic debris, such as plastic bags and bottles, breaks down into smaller microplastic in the sea, often invisible to the eye. The microplastics in the sea spray were between five micrometres and up to 140 micrometres long. The researchers estimated that up to 136,000 tons of microplastic could be blown on shore by sea spray every year. Dr Deonie Allen, the study’s co-research lead, said this was the result of “our mismanaged waste that comes from the terrestrial environment”. She said the findings could help solve the mystery of where “missing” oceanic plastic goes after it leaks into the sea, a puzzle scientists have been trying to solve for years. “The transport mechanism is quite complicated” said Allen. “We know plastic comes out of rivers into the sea. Some goes into gyres, some sinks and goes into the sediment, but the quantity on the sea floor doesn’t match the amount of plastic that would make up this equation. There’s a quantity of missing plastic.” At least an estimated 8m tonnes of plastic enters the sea from land and coasts every year. One study estimates just 240,000 tonnes floats on the surface, leaving a puzzle as to where the rest goes. Various plastic ocean transport models have suggested “leaky basins” to explain areas that do not contain the quantities of plastic predicted. “We know plastic moves in the atmosphere, we know it moves in water,” Allen said. “Now we know it can come back. It is the first opening line of a new discussion.” The researchers captured water droplets from sea spray at Mimizan beach in Aquitaine, on the south-west Atlantic coast of France in the Bay of Biscay, using a “cloud catcher” and filters, set up on top of a sand dune. They analysed the water droplets for microplastics, sampling various wind directions and speeds, including a storm and sea fog. The sea fog generated by the surf produced the highest counts, of 19 plastic particles per cubic metre of air. Previous studies, including one by the same authors that found microplastic pollution in a remote region of the Pyrenees mountains, have already shown that wind can transport microplastics in the atmosphere for long distances."
"Under a small, sun-baked mat, a curled metallic-gold slow worm lies basking in the heat, the dark stripe running down its body revealing its youth. Sensing attention, it begins to wriggle away, revealing a companion, which speeds rapidly into the grasses in the opposite direction. After a winter of social distancing, slow worms – a type of legless lizard that grows up to half a metre long and is often mistaken for a snake – have been venturing out of hibernation to enjoy warming their cold-blooded bodies in the spring sun. Picnics may be out for now, but an assortment of rugs and mats placed around Sutton Ecology Centre, a secluded two-hectare nature reserve tucked away behind a main road in Carshalton, south London, are playing host to a more subterranean kind of socialising. The amorous slow worms, which come in an array of polished silvers, golds and browns depending on age and gender, mate for up to 10 hours at a time in May; there’s a good chance that peeling back the corner of one of the mats in the centre during peak season will reveal two entwined. “It is always a treat to find one,” says Barbara O’Keeffe, a retired local resident who has volunteered at the site for eight years. “When you gently pull back one of the mats to look, for a second you think there’s nothing there, then there’s a glint of gold.” Though they are rarely seen out in the open, slow worms are common throughout the UK. But the ecology centre – which packs in woodlands, wildflower meadows, and a pond currently teeming with tadpoles and wildfowl chicks – is a hotspot. “It is positioned at the point where the chalky North Downs meets London clay, in an area fed by one of only about 200 chalk streams in the world,” says David Warburton, senior biodiversity officer for the London Borough of Sutton, which owns the centre. “The site is ideal for reptiles such as slow worms. We have a really healthy population of them, but they are isolated by surrounding roads and housing.” The reptiles – which live for up to 30 years (the oldest on record was a captive 54-year-old male in Copenhagen zoo) – feast on slugs, snails and insects. In turn they provide food for various birds, as well as badgers and hedgehogs – numbers of which have declined dramatically in the past two decades. Like all six of the UK’s reptile species, slow worms are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, making it illegal to intentionally kill, injure or sell them. But this doesn’t stop them regularly falling victim to carelessly wielded shovels, a risk that could increase as lockdown increases the amount of time people spend in their gardens during the slow worm mating season. “Just be mindful that they’re around,” says Warburton. “They are not at all dangerous. If you find one, be careful not to spook it, or it could shed its tail – which is their main defence mechanism. But by all means get close and marvel at how great they are, look at their eyelids, ear holes, forked tongue, and then leave them where you found them.” Leaving out covers such as old rugs or corrugated iron in a sunny spot can encourage them into the garden, he says. O’Keeffe recommends a bit of messiness in the garden to create a more holistic ecosystem: not mowing areas of lawn, leaving piles of logs and leaves, and ensuring gaps under fences to allow hedgehogs and other animals in and out. “We often have a stall at local events and I remember one lady being delighted, saying ‘Oh, I’ve been feeling guilty about the wild patch at the bottom of my garden … now I’m going to call it my wildlife area.’” In normal times the ecology centre welcomes 7,000 schoolchildren a year. The species that call the wildlife centre home, not least the population of slow worms, are a big draw. “Lots of kids haven’t got any frame of reference for things … snails, worms, everything’s ‘icky’,” says Warburton. The loss of half of the world’s wildlife is at the forefront of the centre’s work. “I don’t think that most people have cottoned onto the fact that there is a biodiversity crisis,” says Warburton. “We teach the kiddies so that they care and will do something about it. Activities like building a stick den, picking up a snail – it helps them to not be scared to get their hands dirty. We try to turn their fear into fascination.” An understanding of natural processes isn’t always better among local adults, according to Warburton, especially in urban areas. He describes the reaction of the public when his team introduced native cattle to the Roundshaw Downs in 2012, a rare chalk grassland three miles south-east, on the site of London’s first international airport in Croydon. They used castrated male Sussex cattle, which are naturally hornless and very placid. “Well, you’d think we’d released lions. Some people were apoplectic. I had to say: ‘This is not Jurassic Park we are creating!’” He wonders if the current crisis might bring about a shift in people’s interest in their local wildlife, including the mysterious slow worm. “Hopefully they might realise you don’t have to go to a national park to see cool and interesting species. Once you’ve seen them in your garden, the whole world opens up.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"There has been little good to say about the recent history of the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. Numbers of the small migratory bird, which makes a return trip from Tasmania’s south-west wilderness to the mainland’s coastal scrubland each year, have fallen so sharply scientists consider it at risk of extinction within five years. Just 23 birds arrived at the species’ breeding site at Melaleuca, deep in the Tasmanian World Heritage Wilderness Area, last spring. But six months on there are tentative positive signs, with the number of birds heading north for the winter reaching 118, the first time the flock has topped 100 in more than a decade. Dr Shannon Troy, a wildlife biologist with the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment, says the population has swelled in three ways, some of them the result of work undertaken by a national recovery team. The group of migrating birds arriving in Melaleuca for the breeding season were met by a further 34 adult birds released from captivity, including some from a new breeding facility at Five Mile Beach, near Hobart airport. The adults from different backgrounds together produced 37 fledglings, and were joined by another 49 captive-bred juveniles. Not every bird survived the warmer months until the parrots headed north between February and April, and the rigours of long-haul travel means less than half those that leave are likely to return. Troy says a good scenario would be 40-to-50 parrots turning up in Melaleuca from September for the next round of breeding. While still a perilously low number, it would be more than double the wild population of a couple of years ago, when it fell to 17. “There’s years when things are not good and it really is disheartening so you decide to celebrate the wins,” Troy says. “It is an amazing feeling to have had over 100 birds migrate together, but at the same time it’s one step. The real change we need to see is the number of birds in spring. That’s census time.” One of the challenges in attempting to build a population from such a low base is its limited genetic diversity. In the spring of 2017, there were just three mature females remaining in the wild. That grew to 13 before last breeding season, but the reduced gene pool increases the risk of disease having a species-wide impact as the remaining birds have similar patterns of immunity. Troy says there is precedent for rebuilding a species from numbers this small. She gives the example of the black robin in New Zealand, which was reduced to one mature female in the wild before numbers rebounded into the hundreds. “There are plenty of populations of bird around the world where genetic diversity is low, but a species has still been able to recover,” she says. “It is definitely a concern, but not necessarily a showstopper.” Dejan Stojanovic, leader of Australian National University’s difficult birds research group, says the good breeding season is great news – obviously enough, there need to be more parrots in the wild for it to recover – but also stresses the greatest threat to the species is survival during the winter migration months. “Hopefully more birds leaving Tasmania corresponds to more survivors returning next spring to breed,” he says. “The big test for all these parrots is still to come.”"
" In July 2017, William Perry Pendley, a crusading conservative attorney, delivered a speech to a group of rightwing activists in North Carolina in which he was completely candid about his ideological commitments. He accused “the media” of selling “their soul to the greens”.  And after criticizing the Endangered Species Act, he made light of killing endangered species. “This is why out west we say ‘shoot, shovel and shut up’ when it comes to the discovery of endangered species on your property,” he said, according to an audio recording of the event obtained by the Guardian. “And I have to say, as a lawyer, that’s not legal advice,” he added, as some in his audience quietly snickered at the reference to the illegal extermination, and the burial, of endangered animals. It has been almost three years since he gave those remarks, and Pendley is now the acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, a powerful agency that oversees more than 240m acres of federal land belonging to the American people, manages mineral resources and is required to comply with environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act. Pendley has helped turn BLM into what one high-level employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, called “a ghost ship” in which “suspicion”, “fear” and “low morale” abound, despite the best efforts of career civil servants to support each other. As Pendley and his superiors at the interior department press ahead with an effort to move BLM’s headquarters from Washington DC to Grand Junction, Colorado, the agency has hemorrhaged staff members and lost critical institutional memory, which many critics believe was the true purpose of the relocation effort all along. “A skeleton crew is left” at BLM headquarters, said the employee. “So few people were able to move west that a lot of people retired early and a lot of people took other jobs, so my ballpark estimate is there is only about 20% of permanent employees left” at headquarters. As a result, the agency is failing to fulfill its most basic duties, like responding to public records requests and conducting oversight of state and regional operations, the staffer added. Environmental and government watchdog groups are now responding with a lawsuit that calls into question the legitimacy of Pendley’s position. Last week a pair of environmental nonprofits sued the interior department, alleging that by repeatedly tapping Pendley as the BLM’s acting director, rather than officially nominating him for the position, the interior secretary has skirted the Senate confirmation process usually required for high-level executive branch appointments, and has violated federal law.  “The illegitimate Pendley appointment is particularly troublesome because he has forcibly moved the BLM Headquarters from Washington DC, to remote western Colorado,” said Peter Jenkins, a senior counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, one of the groups that sued. “In doing so he uprooted the lives of scores of seasoned BLM staff and disrupted this already strained agency.” An interior department spokesperson defended Pendley’s record. “Mr Pendley brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the department and is committed to carrying out the administration’s priorities and achieving the BLM’s … mission for the betterment of the American people,” said Conner Swanson, the spokesperson. “Mr Pendley has provided a steady hand in facilitating important matters, from the BLM headquarters move west to its response to Covid-19.” Swanson has said that the lawsuit against Pendley is “baseless”. Pendley, a tall man with a handlebar mustache and a penchant for cowboy boots, has remarked in the past that his “personal opinions are irrelevant” to his job at BLM. “I have a new job now. I’m a zealous advocate for my client. My client is the American people and my bosses are the president of the United States and [interior] secretary [David] Bernhardt,” Pendley said during an appearance at the conference of the Society of Environmental Journalists in Fort Collins, Colorado, last year. “What I thought, what I wrote, what I did in the past is irrelevant. I have orders, I have laws to obey, and I intend to do that.” Pendley has long opposed public lands and wildlife protections. After serving in the Reagan administration in the 1980s, he became the president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF), a conservative litigation organization funded by conservative and industry groups including the Charles Koch Foundation and Exxon Mobil, according to research from the watchdog groups Documented and Accountable.US. Under Pendley’s leadership, the firm was a persistent foe of federal land agencies, getting involved in dozens of cases on behalf of industry groups and private landowners to challenge environmental protections implemented by the interior department.  Pendley became something of a fixture among the anti-government set, writing numerous books extolling rebellion against public lands and the federal government. He has expressed sympathy in the past for the Bundy family, whose militant agitation against federal land ownership included the armed takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016. He has compared climate change to unicorns because “neither exist”. And in a 2016 National Review article, he laid out a case that argued for the near-total abolition of federal public lands across the nation. Given his long history of legal advocacy on behalf of extractive industries, Pendley brought with him a 17-page recusal list of past clients, employers and investments when he took control of the BLM in 2019. The list included groups such as the American Exploration & Mining Association and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. It has been nearly impossible for the public to know whether Pendley has abided by his recusal list, however, because the BLM has failed to release his detailed official calendar to the public. Though Pendley has long been a committed conservative, he has not always had kind words for Donald Trump. In a 2016 op-ed in the Daily Caller, for instance, he said then-candidate Trump “is not fit to pull off Reagan’s boots”. Apart from Pendley’s role in moving BLM’s headquarters to Colorado, the agency under his leadership has also repeatedly proposed land management plans that heavily promote the energy industry. In March, for instance, conservationists in Montana came out aggressively against a BLM resource management plan that they believe is far too friendly to corporate oil and gas interests, according to the Billings Gazette. In a statement issued earlier this year, Representative Raúl Grijalva, the chairman of the House natural resources committee, expressed his concerns over Pendley. “Anyone who wants our land management agencies to be functional in the future needs to recognize the seriousness of what Secretary Bernhardt, acting director Pendley, and their subordinates are doing.”"
"If there is a more beautiful summer bird in Britain than the common redstart then its name escapes me. The male’s back is the colour of dark limestone. There is a circle of basaltic grey around the face and a flake of quartz at the forecrown, but his breast is the warmest, softest orange in an English spring. In this county Phoenicurus phoenicurus is the genius loci of patchy scrub in limestone dales – those rather widely spread hawthorns that cleave to the top of slopes and whose wind-warped shapes remind me of ancient olives. From the crowns of a nest of these bushes the male was busy inscribing his territory in song. I kept note of the patterns, which were strikingly regular. The phrase is a brief, intense, content-packed two-second burst that is delivered at intervals of six seconds, so in every minute, on average, it issues seven songs. What struck me most was the extent of mimicry entwined in a redstart’s formulaic ditty. The full vocalisation is a performance of two distinct halves. The first second comprises a sequence of rapidly slurred notes that rise in pitch and impact. All redstarts produce it. You hear it, you know instantly who the author is. It is, as it were, the species’ signature sound. Yet the next half, the other second of music, is more individual, more varied, and piled into it are phrases that each bird has copied from other species. This one did incredibly accurate snatches of nuthatch, lesser whitethroat, greenfinch and common whitethroat. Another redstart I attended substituted fragments of linnet, redpoll, siskin and possibly green woodpecker. These parts of the whole song I took to be its individual statement. So the full thing appears to be a complex expression of collective identity, but also of separate vocal prowess. The element that moved me most about sitting here these hours with redstarts was that in half a century I’d never noticed these things before. I was reminded in a personal context of the words of Jean-Henri Fabre, the 19th-century French entomologist: “Human knowledge will be erased from the world’s archives before we possess the last word that a gnat has to say to us.”"
"My lockdown love story began when my glance fell on deep blue eyes. In a sunny glade, the spotlight fell momentarily on the searing blue micro-blooms of germander speedwell, Veronica chamaedrys, each 10mm across, and I was hooked. Speedwells are a group of flowers with three same-sized top petals bullying a much smaller fourth, as if six o’clock was the least important time of day. I’ve known of them for years without paying much attention. V chamaedrys, also known as “bird’s eye”, is relatively tall at 40cm; most of the others are in the floral underclass, crawling and sprawling, without blooms so much as “bloomlets”. I searched my garden and, to my delight, found several other species within metres of each other, with definite and satisfying differences. Slender speedwell, V filiformis, made a “glistening pool”, to borrow a phrase from Richard Mabey, of lilac on the lawn; there were multiflowered stems of the thyme-leaved perennial V serpyllifolia,each a Lilliputian skyscraper, with flowers of clotted-cream off-white; and the ivy-leaved V hederifolia, messily draped across paving stones with apologetic pinkish flowers, so small that you need a hand-lens to see them properly in a book, let alone the real thing. My locked-down world was suddenly that much richer and more varied, and all because of frowned-upon weeds. Look them up and there are many more speedwells – ones adapted to marshes, to chalk, to rivers, to heaths. Some have hitched lifts here, such as the common field speedwell, V persica, from the Caucasus, from Russia but not loved, from stowaway to garden throwaway. There is a variety for every habitat under heaven. Herbalists have found many purposes for them, too. They have been linked to helping respiratory conditions, swellings and inflammations, and, with some supporting evidence from modern science, stomach ulcers. At one time they were seen as a cure-all; indeed, the common name can also mean “thrive well”. But another suggestion is that it means “goodbye”, since the flowers drop their petals when picked, the slightest breeze loosening them. Spikes of them used to be given to travellers for good luck. So, a flower used to wish somebody “bon voyage” grabbed my attention during the very time I couldn’t go anywhere. Perhaps now that we can travel modest distances again, we all need a speedwell to wish us on our way."
"Jam Land, the company part-owned by the energy minister Angus Taylor and his brother Richard, illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands in the New South Wales Monaro region, the federal environment department has concluded. The department has ordered the company to restore 103 hectares of native grassland but Jam Land has avoided a fine and criminal finding. The decision comes three-and-a-half years after Jam Land poisoned the grasslands on a property in Corrowong. Angus Taylor is a shareholder in Jam Land, via his family company Gufee, and his brother Richard is one of Jam Land’s directors. Late on Thursday, Labor called for the prime minister, Scott Morrison to sack Taylor “immediately” after multiple scandals. “Labor is calling for Scott Morrison to finally show leadership on the integrity crises engulfing Mr Taylor and sack him immediately,” Labor’s environment spokeswoman Terri Butler said. The Greens said “it is time the prime minister sacked him” and called for Taylor’s conduct in the Jam Land affair to be the subject of a further investigation. “The conclusion of this investigation does not end concerns about Angus Taylor’s contact with the department during the investigation into Jam Land,” the Greens democracy spokeswoman Larissa Waters said. The Jam Land investigation has taken more than three years and has been controversial because Angus Taylor sought meetings with senior environment officials about the grasslands while it was under way. The office of the then environment minister Josh Frydenberg subsequently sought advice about whether laws protecting the grasslands could be changed. The department’s investigation concludes Jam Land illegally used herbicide on up to 28.5 hectares of the critically endangered natural temperate grassland of the south eastern highlands on a property in Corrowong in NSW on or about 30 October 2016. It orders Jam Land to remediate 103 hectares of the grasslands on the property over a period of six years. Richard Taylor, one of Jam Land’s directors, said the company was considering seeking a review of the remediation order by the minister, as well as other options for appeal. “We think the department has disregarded the outcome of a mediated conference of experts. It also disregarded the photographic evidence that we provided to them, which showed that the grasslands did not meet the condition thresholds [for protection],” he said. Richard Taylor said the company already had 100 hectares fenced off and managed for conservation but this was ignored by the department. He said the remediation order would mean Jam Land was managing a total of 200 hectares for conservation which would make the 800 hectare farm marginal. A spokesman for Angus Taylor said “the department’s decision is a matter for Jam Land. Minister Taylor has no direct or controlling interest in the company.” A Guardian Australia investigation revealed Angus Taylor met with senior environment officials and the office of the former environment minister Josh Frydenberg in March 2017 about the listing of the grasslands while the investigation was underway. Frydenberg’s office sought advice from his department about whether protection for the grasslands could be weakened in secret. Departmental emails also show Frydenberg sought urgent information about the investigation after it was raised in parliament by an unnamed person. Notes from a senior official show Frydenberg later indicated he was “keen to see [if] he can accommodate Angus Taylor’s requests” and asked his department for a “how to guide” on changing laws designed to protect the grasslands. The documents do not make clear what Taylor’s requests were. Angus Taylor has repeatedly stated that he sought the meeting with departmental officials on behalf of constituents in Hume who were concerned about the grasslands listing. Both he and Frydenberg have said the meeting was focused on the “technical aspects” of the grasslands listing. Neither minister has said what Taylor’s “requests” to Frydenberg were but Taylor’s spokesman has said the minister “has never asked Mr Frydenberg to change laws governing the clearing of native grasslands”. The department’s investigation found the use of the poison had a significant impact on the critically endangered grasslands. It found that Jam Land did not refer the activity to the environment minister for consideration and that, at no point, had approval been granted for use of the herbicide. The company has three months to submit a mitigation plan to the department. It has 20 days to apply to the minister for a review of the decision and 28 days to seek an appeal through the federal court. Exactly what will be required to restore the 103 hectares will be the subject of an independent expert report. In a statement, published Wednesday night, the department said: “The department’s investigation found that a critically endangered ecological community, the natural temperate grassland of the South Eastern Highlands, was significantly impacted by the application of herbicide. “It is a breach of a civil penalty provision of part three of the act to take an action that significantly impacts a critically endangered ecological community without an approval under the act. “In responding to the contravention of the act, the delegate to the minister for the environment made a remediation determination on 28 April 2020, requiring Jam Land Pty Ltd as the landholder to mitigate the damage by managing and enhancing the natural ecological values of 103 hectares of native grasslands on the property. “A remediation determination is a penalty that addresses the environmental impact caused by a contravention of part three of the act by requiring a person to take action to repair or mitigate that damage. “This compliance outcome is consistent with the department’s published compliance policy.”"
"Researchers and citizens in Washington state are on a careful hunt for invasive “murder hornets”, after the insect made its first appearance in the US. The Asian giant hornet is the world’s largest and can kill humans. But it is most dangerous for the European honeybee, which is defenseless in the face of the hornet’s spiky mandibles, long stinger and potent venom. Washington state verified four reports of Asian giant hornets in two north-western cities in December. The species becomes more active in April, prompting local officials to invite the public to help beekeepers by creating their own hornet traps. “It’s a shockingly large hornet,” Todd Murray, Washington State University Extension entomologist and invasive species specialist, said in a statement. “It’s a health hazard, and more importantly, a significant predator of honeybees.” Murray said it was important for people to learn to recognize the insect now, while the population is small and still new to the region. “We need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small,” he said, “so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.” The hornets are about the size of an adult thumb, with a yellow and orange head. They are most destructive in the late summer and early fall. One telltale sign they have visited a hive is the remains of decapitated bees. Some researchers refer to the insect as a “murder hornet”, according to a New York Times story published on Saturday. In Japan, up to 50 people a year die after being stung, though the hornet is usually only aggressive to humans if it is disturbed. The Times story prompted a slew of comments on social media, noting the appearance of the hornets in the US in 2020, alongside famine, pestilence and war. “Whomever had murder by hornet on their apocalypse bingo card, please step forward to collect your winnings,” wrote Kaz Weida, a freelance journalist. The comedian Patton Oswalt shared the story and wrote “murder hornets. Sure thing, 2020. Give us everything. Hypno-frogs. Fecal blizzards. Toilet tsunamis. A CATS sequel. We can take it.” The author Rabih Alameddine posted: “I really think that was missing from my life this year was murder hornets.”"
"London has had dramatic improvements in its air quality since the coronavirus lockdown, with dangerous emissions at some of the capital’s busiest roads and junctions falling by almost 50%. Figures released by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, show that anti-pollution measures introduced from 2017 had already led to a 35% drop across the capital of the harmful gas nitrogen dioxide, NO2 – rising to a 44% reduction inside central London’s ultra-low emissions zone (ULEZ). In the last four weeks of lockdown there have been further big reductions, with NO2 falling by a further 27% across London, and by almost half at some of the worst pollution hotspots. Khan welcomed the decline in toxic air, but said that once the lockdown was over it was essential that the efforts to improve London’s toxic air continued. “This cleaner air should not just be temporary. So once the current emergency has passed and we start to recover, our challenge will be to eradicate air pollution permanently and ensure the gains we’ve made through policies such as ULEZ continue.” Although the figures show a big reduction in NO2, particulate pollution, which comes largely from domestic wood burning and agriculture, and which is very harmful to human health, remains a severe threat in London. Elizabeth Fonseca, an air quality expert at the Environmental Defence Fund Europe, said that long-term cleaner air was essential to protect people’s health. “Nitrogen dioxide pollution has gone down, but London recently saw huge spikes in dangerous particulate pollution. A few weeks’ or months’ improvement of just one pollutant doesn’t make lung disease and other ailments disappear.” There is mounting evidence of detrimental health impacts of air pollution, through lung disease, heart attacks, asthma, effects on pregnancies and on intelligence levels. Research published on Monday also found that the five most polluted regions among 66 analysed in Italy, Spain, France and Germany accounted for 78% of all reported Covid-19 deaths in those areas. Another study looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates. In the UK NO2 has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last 10 years. A key policy to reduce levels involves clean air zones – such as the ultra-low emissions zone in London – where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres. But the coronavirus crisis has seen some councils delay the planned introduction of clean air zones. Many cities across Europe, and some in the UK, have begun to unveil ambitious cycling and walking schemes to ensure people can move around safely and maintain the environmental benefits, in terms of cleaner air and safer streets, that have come about amid the lockdown. Gary Fuller, an air pollution expert at King’s College London, welcomed Thursday’s figures and said the policies introduced in London and elsewhere proved air pollution could be tackled. He said: “Breathing bad air has had an intolerable impact of Londoners’ health for far too long … but even before the Covid lockdown, London’s air pollution was undergoing a dramatic change for the better. “Nitrogen dioxide in central London and along main bus routes was improving at some of the fastest rates we’ve ever measured. We need to remember these lessons going forward. These successes show that our city’s air pollution is not an intractable problem and that actions can bring results.” Prof Stephen Holgate, an adviser on air quality at the Royal College of Physicians, said that although Covid-19 had wreaked havoc, the “dreadful virus has brought the importance of outdoor space and the environment into focus”. He added: “We’re all looking forward to the time when the lockdown is lifted, and once it does I sincerely hope we’ll be able to retain some of the new cleaner and greener habits we’ve developed.”"
"The skies are clearing of pollution, wildlife is returning to newly clear waters, a host of flights have been scrapped and crude oil is so worthless that the industry would have to pay you to take it off their hands – a few months ago, environmentalists could only dream of such a scenario as the 50th anniversary of Earth Day hove into view. But this disorientingly green new reality is causing little cheer given the cause is the coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged much of the world. “This isn’t the way we would’ve wanted things to happen, God no,” said Gina McCarthy, former head of the US Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration. “This is just a disaster that pointed out the underlying challenges we face. It’s not something to celebrate.” Wednesday’s annual Earth Day event, this year largely taking place online, comes as public health restrictions to prevent the spread of Covid-19 have resulted in a sharp dip in air pollution across China, Europe and the US, with carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels heading for a record 5% annual drop. The waters of Venice are now clear, lions lounge on roads normally frequented by safari-goers in South Africa and bears and coyotes wander around empty accommodation in Yosemite national park in California. Meanwhile, nearly eight in 10 flights globally have been canceled, with many planes in the US carrying just a handful of people. The oil industry, a key driver of the climate crisis and direct environmental disaster, is in turmoil, with a barrel of crude hitting an unprecedented minus-$40 on Monday. These would perhaps be the sort of outcomes seen had stringent environmental policies been put in place in the wake of the first Earth Day in 1970, which saw 20 million Americans rally in support of anti-pollution measures. Instead, the pain of the Covid-19 shutdown has highlighted how ponderous the world’s response has been – the expected cut in emissions, for example, is still less than what scientists say is needed every year this decade to avoid disastrous climate impacts for much of the world. “It’s the worst possible way to experience environment improvement and it has also shown us the size of the task,” said Michael Gerrard, an environmental law expert at Columbia University. How people react to the return of normalcy after the pandemic will help define the crises racking the environment, according to Gerrard. “A key question will be do we have a green recovery, do we seize the opportunity to create jobs in renewable energy and in making coastlines more resilient to climate change?” he said. “The current US president clearly has no inclination to do this.” McCarthy, now head of the Natural Resources Defense Council, noted that some Indian people were seeing the Himalayas for the first time due to the veil of air pollution lifting. “You wonder if people will want to go back to what it was like before,” she said. “The pandemic has shown people will change their behavior if it’s for the health of their families. This has been the lost message on climate, that it’s a human problem, not a planetary problem. We have to show you can have a stable environment and your job, too.” The problems in the natural world haven’t suddenly vanished – this week various researchers found that the Arctic is very likely to be free of sea ice in summers before 2050, that the bushfires that torched Australia earlier this year released more carbon than the country’s annual CO2 output and that the first quarter of 2020 was the second-warmest on record. Donald Trump has signaled that he will try to provide a bailout to the US oil and gas industry, with $25bn already handed out by the US government to prop up airlines. In China, it’s not certain that the wildlife-packed “wet markets” where Covid-19 is believed to have originated will be shut down. Conservationists warn that returning the world to its pre-pandemic settings will quickly wipe out any environmental benefits of the shutdown. “It’s a serious wake-up call,” said Thomas Lovejoy, an ecologist who coined the term “biological diversity”. “We bulldoze into the last remaining places in nature and then are surprised when something like this happens. We have done this to ourselves by our continual intrusion into nature. We have to re-chart our course.” This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

"Antelope is best, monkey is chewy, bats needs a sauce, forest porcupine is mild, and pangolin – one of the most trafficked animals in the world – tastes great roasted but smells awful. That, at least, was what the Gabonese workers told us. We were in a Belgian-owned logging camp in Gabon. The day had been spent watching giant trees being felled for the Chinese market but by evening everyone’s thoughts had turned to food. Most rural Africans and Asians say “bush” or wild meat is healthier, tastier and often cheaper than the bland meat of most farmed animals like chickens or pigs. The joke among the African loggers in the camp that night was that Asians would eat anything alive in the forest but the squeamish Europeans would eat nothing.  Today, as a result of Covid-19 and its suspected origins in a Chinese “wet” market, governments and the World Health Organization are coming under growing pressure from conservationists, vegans, and animal protection, zoo, and welfare groups to not just stop the hunting of all wild animals for food but to end the commercial trade in live animals with a global ban. Now is the time to link human health with biodiversity loss and animal suffering and to close all markets selling live or dead wild animals, they say. A spokeswoman for WWF UK says: “We have called for the closure of illegal and unregulated wildlife markets, primarily in urban areas. What we are concerned about is the illegal consumption of highly threatened wildlife, often seen as a delicacy.” There is no doubt that wild meat hunting and consumption is heavily impacting the world’s wildlife, giving rise to what is called “the empty forest”, where few large mammals remain. A 2016 Royal Society paper shows that the bushmeat trade is growing fast, with devastating results. “As wildlife populations outside protected areas decline, poaching pressure is increasing in many parks and reserves,” say the authors. “As a consequence many forests, savannahs, grasslands and deserts in the developing world are now becoming ‘empty landscapes’ devoid of harvest-sensitive wild mammals.” What has changed over 50 years, say scientists, is the scale of the commercial wild meat trade. In the past, local subsistence hunters killed animals in small numbers. Today a high-volume industry supplies fast-expanding Asian and African cities. No longer run by local hunters, it is helped by modern firearms and cellphones, and utilises a vast network of new roads driven deep into forest concessions by the international logging industry. Hunters can strip a forest or wetland in a few nights and access home and export markets for their meat. And as the forests are emptied of their animals, the price of wild meat soars and it becomes a luxury commodity for urban elites. Sue Lieberman, vice-president of international policy at the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, says that growing populations in Africa and Asia must switch to eating farmed animals. “People do need other sources of food [than bushmeat]. I am not saying that people should not eat wild animals [but] there is not enough to go round any more. Commercialisation is the problem. The first priority must be to stop the commercial markets. They can’t go on. Practices that originated hundreds of years ago have to stop. The amount it would cost to provide chicken and farmed fish to everyone [in Africa] is negligible compared to what this pandemic is costing.” But critics of a ban say that the legal wildlife meat trade employs hundreds of thousands of people, provides protein for between 30 million and 70 million people in Africa alone and kills few threatened, or rare animals. What about the environmental impacts of farming? According to a major 2011 study led by Robert Nasi, director general of the Center for International Forestry Research (Cifor), a switch to cattle to provide protein in place of wild animals would have huge impact. Hunters, says Nasi, take about 4.5m tonnes of bushmeat a year from forests in the Congo basin and possibly 1.299m tonnes in the Amazon. “We would need to transform large areas of tropical forests or savannas into pasture to replace [this amount of] bushmeat by cattle. For comparison, Brazilian beef production is considered responsible for about 50m hectares [124m acres – twice the size of the UK] of deforestation. If bushmeat consumption in the Congo basin was to be replaced by locally produced beef, an area as large as 25 m hectares might have to be converted to pastures.” Factory farming has devastating effects on wildlife, says Philip Lymbery, director of UK-based Compassion in World Farming. “It is a main driver of wildlife decline and the destruction of the world’s remaining wild lands,” he says. “It’s about keeping animals caged in sheds, which sounds efficient but you have to devote vast areas of land to grow their feed. It drives encroachment into wild lands and the destruction of habitats. “It would cause unimaginable suffering to the animals, and even more environmental devastation. It would also create the perfect breeding ground for the next pandemic. Factory farming and pandemics are strongly linked. The main driver of future pandemics will be factory farming.” Many epidemiologists, ecologists, human rights and indigenous peoples’ groups say a knee-jerk global reaction to ban the wild meat trade could be unscientific, counter-productive and culturally offensive. The western conservation “industry” wants an end to the eating of wild animals because it wants vast new areas of land to be “protected” in the name of increasing biodiversity, says Fiore Longo, advocacy officer of Survival International. “But this model of ‘fortress conservation’ is dangerous,” she says. “Conservationists have seized the crisis as a chance to criminalise the ways of life of a large part of the world’s population. It reinforces the false divide between people and wildlife, and potentially vastly increases the size of protected areas whatever the human cost may be. “What happens if we outlaw the trade and consumption of wildlife where there are no other sources of protein available? Do we let more people starve? Is a dependence on industrial food production with all its enormous environmental, health and financial impacts somehow ‘better’ than the sustainable consumption of wild animals?” “It is important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” says John Fa, coordinator of the Bushmeat Research Initiative at Cifor. “Wild meat plays an important role in the nutrition of large populations of humans, accounting for up to 50% of the protein intake of people in central Africa. You can’t just say to people: ‘You can’t do it any more.’” Wildlife hunting bans mostly fail, says Stephanie Brittain, who spent five years in Cameroon researching bushmeat consumption and now works with Oxford University’s Interdisciplinary Centre for Conservation Science. After the 2013–16 Ebola outbreak in west Africa, she says, bans were brought in by several countries but could not be policed. The result was a marked increase in hunting for wild meat. “There [is] no conclusive evidence that banning the wildlife trade will prevent the emergence of zoonotic diseases in the future,” she says. “The legal trade for species that can be safely harvested can facilitate improved hygiene and animal welfare, while complete bans can drive trade underground, resulting in illegal markets with lower hygiene regulation and increased risk of disease transmission.” As for the idea that disease is more likely to accompany wild meat, experts point out that illnesses like Mers and Sars, BSE, swine and bird flu, E coli, MRSA and salmonella, originated in intensive poultry, pig and livestock farms where the overuse of antibiotics and unhygienic conditions can spread disease quickly. Many are common. According to the OIE, the World Organisation for Animal Health, there are currently more than 25 outbreaks of H5 and H7 avian flu having to be controlled in more than 20 countries, including the US, Germany, India and Saudi Arabia. Any one, if unattended by vets, could develop into an epidemic. “Intensive farming is an area that must also be looked at”, says Eric Fevre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at Liverpool University. “As we select for better milk cows, better beef cows or better egg-laying chickens, we create populations of animals that often live in intensive conditions, but where the genetics are very similar. This creates risks for [the] emergence of diseases, because if these genetically uniform large populations are susceptible, things can spread very quickly.” Delia Grace, programme leader for food safety and zoonoses at the International Livestock Research Institute, said: “Wet markets are basically fresh food markets. In the UK we like farmers’ markets with fresh cornfed chickens, farm-sourced meats and nice looking sausages. That’s basically a wet market, though in a different cultural context. They are essential to bring fresh food to urban populations, and provide for the food security of millions of people. “They do need to be regulated and controlled. They should not be blanket banned, as that is not sensitive to the needs of their clients who depend on them.” Conservationists are struggling to diminish consumption of wild animals through behaviour campaigns, legislation and law enforcement – especially in urban Africa, says Congo analyst Theodore Trefon, a researcher at the Belgian Royal Museum for central Africa. “Many consumers [there] believe that eating bushmeat is quite simply normal, respectful of tradition, healthy, desirable and commonsensical,” he says. “This is a well-known challenge to wildlife conservationists but one that is relatively new to public health experts confronted by known and yet-to-come zoonotic diseases.” This piece was edited on 27 May 2020 to clarify Stephanie Brittain’s experience in Cameroon and correct the name of her institution"
"Councils are burning household recycling after being hit by a massive surge in domestic waste and coronavirus-related staff absences during the pandemic, the Guardian has learned. Councils in Cardiff, St Helens and Inverclyde confirmed they were temporarily incinerating recycling, while those in Oldham, Redbridge and West Dunbartonshire also said they had stepped down their recycling services for the time being. A further six authorities have stopped collecting glass or cardboard. Cardiff city council said it was continuing to collect recycled material as usual and was asking residents to rinse out their recycling and sort items in the correct bags even though the materials would be incinerated for the near future. “Strange as it seems, we still need you to put recyclables into your green recycling bags so that we can return to recycling the waste when we are able,” the council said in a statement. The coronavirus lockdown has generated a massive increase in domestic waste collection UK-wide, with nearly a third of authorities reporting an increase of between 20% and 50% on normal volumes of waste collected through household bins. Nearly one in 10 reported waste increases of up to twice as much as usual. The pressure on local waste disposal services has been underlined by data showing that huge areas of the country have suspended bulky waste collection (55% of councils), garden waste disposal (29%), and food waste (10%) to cope with the crisis. A survey of 250 UK councils carried out by the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (Adept) found that a quarter of local waste teams reported losing up to 40% of staff through illness or self-isolation last week. The charity Keep Britain Tidy has warned that some councils are struggling to keep on top of fly-tipping, suggesting that it might be linked to an increase in DIY and decluttering as people stay at home, as well as the widespread closure of household recycling centres under physical distancing rules. However, all councils have maintained normal or near-normal levels of domestic refuse collection, and just 2% have suspended recycling. Fears that reductions in recycling collection would lead to a shortage of cardboard packaging have receded, with about 10 councils restarting suspended recycling services. Ian Fielding, chair of Adept’s Waste Group, said: “It is encouraging to see that local authorities are maintaining core waste services with minimal disruption and that councils are able to put resources into tackling fly-tipping.” Just 32% of councils are operating normal levels of street sweeping, the Adept survey showed, although the majority were experiencing only moderate or minor disruption. About 7% reported “severe disruption” to street cleaning services. Richard McIlwain, deputy chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy, said: “As organisations providing key frontline services, local authorities are having to prioritise core services, including the regular collection of our household waste. “However, we are aware that some local authorities are reporting an increase in fly-tipping, potentially linked to the temporary closure of recycling centres. Fly-tipping is a serious environmental crime that blights local communities and harms wildlife, and local authorities should not be having to deal with increased illegal dumping. “At a time of national crisis, we all have a personal role to play in keeping our environment safe. If you have rubbish you can’t put in your normal bin, either store it until the recycling centres are open or pay for a waste company to take it away, checking first that they are correctly licensed as a waste carrier with the Environment Agency and always ask for a receipt.” An Inverclyde council spokesperson said: “The reintroduction of recycling collections remains an urgent priority. Like most Scottish councils, we experienced a significant reduction in workforce due to national guidance around self-isolation.”"
"The Apex was nearly finished. A brand new cruise ship for the Celebrity Cruises line, it was a towering, 117,000-ton vessel with luxuries like a “resort deck” featuring martini-glass-shaped jacuzzis and a movable platform cantilevered off the side – known as “the Magic Carpet” – to be used as an outdoor restaurant. As the builders put the finishing touches to it, the company held parties for crew and contractors, even as the rest of the world was shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties, she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship’s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port. “It’s really scary, you don’t know how long it’s going to last,” says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. “When I called medical and said, ‘can you get me some medicine, my head is going to explode’, they said, ‘there are people sicker than you, stay where you are’.” She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April, alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers, despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide. The ship is not an exception. Across the world, a Guardian investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew. Nedeltcheva, who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria, may have been one of the lucky ones. Upwards of 100,000 other crew members – including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex – remain trapped on their ships. Most have no communication with the outside world, and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the Guardian’s investigation, however, a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai. The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated, Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria, which had just pulled into Southampton, were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard, according to a recording of the captain’s announcement obtained by Business Insider. In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas, from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida, that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances, according to an account from an employee given to the Miami Herald. Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, is Julia Melim, a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity’s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship’s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms. The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven’t suffered higher infection rates than those on land. A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: “We have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe, healthy, cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.” The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected, but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships. “This accounts for 0.06% of confirmed cases globally,” said the association in a statement. “It is hard to tell how many of those confirmed cases are crew members, as we are still in the process of collecting that information as well.” Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem, given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases. Another cruise ship, the Ruby Princess, which is blamed for spreading the disease around Australia in March, has now surpassed the Diamond Princess in the scale of its deadly outbreak – 21 people died and 900 were infected aboard the ship. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has specifically identified cruise ships as being global spreaders of coronavirus. “Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of the semi-enclosed environment and contact between travelers from many countries,” said a 4 April CDC order, barring those leaving cruise ships from taking any commercial flights in the US. “Outbreaks of Covid-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage.” Most ships have only one doctor and a few nurses for thousands of passengers and crew, workers say The ships generally rely on hospitals on shore for urgent care. Because of the pandemic, however, the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases. “They are basically getting no healthcare,” says Michael Winkleman, the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. “They are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call, no one comes.” Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies, including Carnival and Royal Caribbean, are headquartered in the US, the companies are registered in low-tax countries. Carnival is technically a Panamanian company and Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia, meaning they pay almost no US taxes. Likewise their ships are typically flagged in countries such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which allows them to avoid strict safety standards, labour laws and environmental restrictions they might otherwise face in the US. US Coast Guard officials said in a memo on 29 March that outbreaks aboard ships are straining the rescue and medical resources in the Florida region. The bulletin, first obtained by the Miami Herald, asked ships carrying more than 50 people to prepare to provide their own medical care to those onboard for extended periods. “Foreign-flagged ships that loiter beyond US territorial seas, particularly those registered in the Bahamas” should seek assistance from the countries where they are flagged, it added. Officials in the Bahamas responded with their own memo, saying the medical system of the tiny Caribbean island nation would be overwhelmed if it had to take on caring for all those sick aboard cruise ships. “The cruise industry is facing an unprecedented crisis, and we in the Bahamas, facing the same global crisis, are doing what we can to provide support,” said the statement by the ministry of transport and local government. “Our system is not designed to deal with a massive influx of new Covid-19 patients from outside our country.” On some ships, crew members say they are being treated well, and some have been moved to passenger cabins with balconies and more space in which to spend their quarantine. Crew on the Celebrity Serenade made a parody video of their time confined to their cabins at sea. Some reported getting bonuses from their cruise lines. The Celebrity Edge, currently floating in the Bahamas, distributed a video of the ship’s captain delivering meals to the rooms of quarantined workers. On other ships, the situation is dire. Workers have complained that food seemed to be running out, and that they were forced to pay for internet time. Many crew have had their pay cut off entirely. Workers on board several ships run by the Geneva-based MSC cruise line, according to letters from MSC seen by the Guardian, are no longer being paid after their contracts ran out or were terminated early by the company because of the global pandemic.  A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: “MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating, we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships’ operations. We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge, assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use.” A former crew member for another major cruise liner, Krista Thomas, who lives in Vancouver, has been running a private Facebook group to update crew members at sea about how to get home. She says many crew are scared to speak out. They depend on the cruise industry for livelihoods, and cruise ship pay – while low compared to average wages in many developed countries – is often many times higher than what they can earn at home. “They’re probably not just taking care of a wife and kids; they’re taking care of parents and in-laws,” says Thomas. “They are living contract to contract to get by … They don’t want to tear the industry down. It has taken a huge hit because of what’s happened and they don’t want to see their industry fall apart.” Ross Klein, who has written books criticising the cruise industry and runs a website that reports incidents involving cruises, says crew members from developing countries “are in as close to indentured servitude as it gets”. He argues that the cruise companies bear a responsibility to care for them. “The workers are powerless,” he says. “The employers have a moral and ethical duty to care for these people they brought from around the world. There have got to be ways to work out a solution to get these people safely home.” Alexandra Nedeltcheva, still experiencing the symptoms of Covid-19, has had to pay for an Airbnb to quarantine near her home in Bulgaria, so she doesn’t expose her family. She still worries about her friends aboard the Celebrity Apex in Saint-Nazaire in France. There, as of 14 April, two workers remained hospitalised with severe Covid-19 and 700 crew were still working or isolating, according to a report by a French TV station. Nedeltcheva says she has enjoyed seeing the world in her 11 years working with Celebrity Cruises, but the treatment she says crew have received during the pandemic has opened her eyes. “I really want something to change,” she says. “They can take much better care of their crew. It’s time the cruising industry does better.”"
"A bacterium that feeds on toxic plastic has been discovered by scientists. The bug not only breaks the plastic down but uses it as food to power the process. The bacterium, which was found at a waste site where plastic had been dumped, is the first that is known to attack polyurethane. Millions of tonnes of the plastic is produced every year to use in items such as sports shoes, nappies, kitchen sponges and as foam insulation, but it is mostly sent to landfill because it it too tough to recycle. When broken down it can release toxic and carcinogenic chemicals which would kill most bacteria, but the newly discovered strain is able to survive. While the research has identified the bug and some of its key characteristics, much work remains to be done before it can be used to treat large amounts of waste plastic. “These findings represent an important step in being able to reuse hard-to-recycle polyurethane products,” said Hermann Heipieper, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ in Leipzig, Germany, who is one of the research team. He said it might be 10 years before the bacterium could be used at a large scale and that in the meantime it was vital to reduce the use of plastic that is hard to recycle and to cut the amount of plastic in the environment. More than 8bn tonnes of plastic has been produced since the 1950s and most has ended up polluting the world’s land and oceans, or in landfill dumps. Scientists say it threatens a “near permanent contamination of the natural environment”. The research, published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology, identified a new strain of Pseudomonas bacteria, a family known for its ability to withstand harsh conditions, such as high temperatures and acidic environments. The researchers fed it key chemical components of polyurethane in the laboratory. “We found the bacteria can use these compounds as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy,” Heipieper said. Fungi has been used before to break down polyurethane, but bacteria are much easier to harness for industrial use. Heipieper said the next step would be to identify the genes that code for the enzymes produced by the bug that break down the polyurethane. Scientists revealed in 2018 that they had accidentally created a mutant enzyme that breaks down plastic drinks bottles, which are made of PET, potentially enabling the complete recycling of bottles for the first time. One of the team behind this advance, Prof John McGeehan, the director of the Centre for Enzyme Innovation at the University of Portsmouth, England, praised the new work. “The breakdown of certain polyurethanes can release toxic additives, which need to be handled carefully. This research group has discovered a strain that can tackle some of these chemicals,” he said. “While there is still much work to be done, this is exciting and necessary research that demonstrates the power of looking to nature to find valuable biocatalysts. Understanding and harnessing such natural processes will open the door for innovative recycling solutions.” Heipieper said: “When you have huge amounts of plastic in the environment, that means there is a lot of carbon and there will be evolution to use this as food. Bacteria are there in huge numbers and their evolution is very fast. “However, this certainly doesn’t mean that the work of microbiologists can lead to a complete solution,” he said. “The main message should be to avoid plastic being released into the environment in the first place.” Previous research has also shown that some fungi can break down PET plastic, while wax moth larvae – usually bred as fish bait – can eat up polythene bags."
"For eight hours a day, from March until May, research biologist Will Hawkes surveys huge swarms of insects landing on the Karpaz Peninsula on the north-east corner of Cyprus. “This place is a migratory hotspot for millions of painted lady butterflies, drone fly hoverflies, seven-spot ladybirds and vagrant emperor dragonflies – it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before,” says Hawkes, a PhD student at the University of Exeter’s Genetics of Migration lab who first studied the phenomenon here a year ago. “This island is a pit stop for millions of insects that fly at high altitudes over the sea then come to land to rest as they migrate, possibly thousands of kilometres from the Middle East to western Europe. It’s just astonishing that these creatures migrate such long distances and in such vast numbers in order to find the right food to eat and to reproduce in environments at particular temperatures,” he says. “One grass fly we found at Cyprus is just 2mm long, so, for their body size, these migrations are quite incredible. Most of the time they’re completely invisible to us,” adds Hawkes, who explains that the distances travelled by insects flying via Cyprus are as yet unknown. The furthest insect migration recorded is the 18,000km journey of the 4cm-long globe skimmer dragonfly between India and Africa. Hawkes’s PhD supervisor, Dr Karl Wotton, describes his research at Karpaz as significant. “Migration hotspots like this are a window into processes that normally go on unseen, high above our heads, as huge amounts of insects make seasonal movements,” says Wotton. “This Cyprus hotspot shows how distant ecosystems can nevertheless be connected. It’s part of an emerging global picture of insects on the move.” Hawkes collects insects flying along a gully using a butterfly net in a “Victorian-style study”, then puts them into an insect cage to identify the species before releasing them. He also sets up tiny cameras to record insects flying past for timed periods at set intervals – back in the UK, he spends weeks manually counting the numbers in every shot, frame by frame. “We can record thousands of insects flying past per minute – it’s a big challenge,” says Hawkes who, by returning annually, is building a long-term data set to let scientists observe trends and patterns over time. “Some butterfly, dragonfly and hoverfly migrations have previously been studied but very few studies look at the bigger picture of insect migration. There are huge gaps in our knowledge; we’re genuinely at the very beginning of understanding these insect migrations.” Radar studies show that 3.5 trillion insects (3,200 tons of biomass) migrate annually above southern Britain alone, as published in the journal Science. “Many of these insects are key pollinators and play a major role in pest control, so they’re absolutely vital to agriculture simply due to their sheer numbers,” says Hawkes. “Flies are the most numerous migrants and they have such an enormous impact on the biodiversity of our ecosystems and pollination of crops and plants.” In July 2019, Wotton, a senior lecturer at Exeter, revealed in the journal Current Biology that 1-4 billion hoverflies migrate into and out of southern Britain each year. As larvae, these hoverflies consume 3-10 trillion aphids, a species that would otherwise be damaging to crops. As adults, hoverflies eat nectar and pollen and are second only to bees in terms of their importance as pollinators. Wotton recorded that migrant hoverflies each carry on average 10 grains of pollen, flying up to 100 miles a day. By transferring pollen between different populations of plants as they travel, migratory insects help maintain a diverse gene pool for wild plants and crops, increasing resilience to changes in environmental conditions and the effects of climate change. Remarkably, insects are multigenerational migrants – one full circuit involves between three and six generations of adults moving north from springtime to late summer, followed by one generation travelling back south during the autumn migration. The adults die once eggs are laid, before larvae hatch, so these long-distance migrations are not learned behaviours. “These migrations are purely genetic. Insects use the sun as their compass and only migrate on days when the winds are favourable,” says Hawkes, who also surveys insects flying along the valleys in the Pyrenees mountains on their autumn migration south. “It’s also likely that when a huge volume of adults dies at the end of each leg of the journey, their biomass provides a seasonal input of nutrients in each location which could be a key food source for other species.” But with plummeting insect populations, conserving biodiversity has never been more crucial. A global review published in the journal Biological Conservation found that more than 40% of insect species are declining and a third are endangered. “Migratory insects are vulnerable to habitat loss beyond the boundaries of one country, and climate breakdown could affect the migration routes and ranges of these insect species so we need to take a more global, holistic view of conservation,” says Hawkes, who believes farmers can make an enormous difference by reducing the use of pesticides and leaving field margins to grow wild. “It’s easy to see the difference in numbers of insect types between a patch of wildflowers at the edge of a field and the middle of a crop – we need to move away from monoculture towards agro-ecology.” Matt Shardlow, chief executive of invertebrate conservation charity Buglife, warns that spray drift and soil transport of pesticides into field margins pose a risk and that wildflower-rich habitats should be prioritised in urban areas, on road verges and railways, away from crops sprayed with pesticides. “We’re restoring wildflower grassland to increase the availability of pollen and nectar for dispersing wild insects along a network of insect pathways called B-Lines throughout the British countryside and towns,” says Shardlow, who is keen to persuade the authorities and EU partners to roll the network out across Europe. “These B-Lines will enable better dispersal of migrants and enable more species to start dispersing north again – something that’s prevented by increasingly fragmented habitats and the polluted nature of intervening land.” On an international scale, further research is required before the science of this Cyprus migration hotspot can influence policy and conservation management. “We need further understanding of the biology of the species involved, natural variation in numbers and the routes taken before any strong recommendations can be made,” Wotton says. “Conservation of entire migratory tracks takes collaboration between farmers, conservationists and politicians,” Hawkes adds. “We need to think beyond borders and consider how habitats link together along these migratory routes. “At an international level, we need politicians to realise that insects are playing a vital role so that governments create consistent policies that protect the diversity of insects and the plants they rely on.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features "
"New York has reported a surge in cycling as people try to avoid public transport during the coronavirus epidemic. In New York City, Mexico City, and Bogotá city authorities are planning “emergency” cycleways.  London has made its bike hire scheme free to health workers, and bicycle shops have been listed as essential businesses to remain open while other shops are closed.  But many people are reluctant to take to their bikes because they think it is more dangerous than other ways of travelling. Setting aside Covid-19, studies done during more normal times show that the health benefits from cycling outweigh the downsides – namely breathing polluted air (cyclists breath faster than those in cars or walking) and accidents, but this varies from place to place.  The tipping point, when the harm from breathing extra pollution outweighs the benefits from exercise, is reached in just 1% of the world’s cites.  None of these are in Europe or the Americas. Future investment in cycle infrastructure could decrease accidents and improve the benefits ratio even further."
"What is it about mating common frogs that is so humorous? Part of it is surely their physical comedy, such as the winking white throats bellowing in and out as the males chorus at the surface. Then there are the old man’s skinny legs on all frogs. My mother-in-law mentions the ear-to-ear grin across every frog face. Another friend talks about an aura of “smugness” about them and, indeed, there is something faintly ridiculous about the way one will climb across the spawn lolling at the surface, and stand on top, full square, head raised proudly as if in ownership of the entire hoard. There is also something gloriously shameless about frogs: how they will clamber over their fellows, briefly smothering them or working with those immense hindlegs against a neighbour’s face, forcing each gold-rimmed black eye to close, then reopen after it finally passes. None seems to mind either the inconvenience or these levels of familiarity. The thing I love most, aside from the song – the throaty granular music that swells up at the surface and is as smooth as frog skin in water – is the animals’ collective willingness to accept me. Make a sudden move and you are left with an empty pond, but for many small overlapping ripples, yet slow your pace to a heron’s stalk and you can get right down among them. In fact, I can vouch that a human thumb and four fingers at the water’s surface can start to seem highly attractive to an amorous frog. At that range you can watch each pinhole nostril on an amphibian’s nose, billowing air in and out, working precisely as it has done for the last 200m years. And to kneel in my waders among the pond’s atmosphere of natural abundance, to be accepted on equal terms by its owners, provided a special kind of reward. For a moment, amid the wider church-bell-ringing song of song thrushes or the chiming of great tits, surrounded by the fellowship of frogs, I was allowed to feel that March 2020 was like any other spring, and that all would soon be well with the world."
"South Australian authorities have been criticised by traditional owners and environmental groups for issuing a permit for the culling of southern hairy-nosed wombats on the Yorke Peninsula. The permit was issued for Aboriginal Lands Trust lands at Point Pearce, which are leased to a farmer, under laws that allow for the culling of “abundant wildlife” that is “causing damage”. It comes a month after the Victorian government revoked a 23-year-old law that declared wombats an “unprotected” species. The SA Department of Environment and Water refused to say what damage was specified in the request for this permit, or how many animals were intended to be culled, but Narungga traditional owners have told Guardian Australia it was a significant number. A department spokeswoman said: “The owner of Point Pearce, Aboriginal Lands Trust (ALT), applied for and received a permit for the humane destruction of wombats.” Under SA regulations, the department said, landholders can apply for a permit to destroy native wildlife “where those animals are damaging, or are likely to damage, the environment, crops, stock, property or environmental amenity, or are posing a safety risk or hazard to people or industry”. The decision takes into account the species abundance, “human safety and economic considerations” and what other management methods have been “undertaken or considered”. SA does not publish annual figures on the number and type of wildlife culled under its permit system, but figures released under freedom of information laws for 2016-2017 show that 44 permits were issued to kill 803 southern hairy-nosed wombats this year. The Victorian government issued 252 permits to allow for the killing of 3,374 common wombats in 2017, and 268 permits for the culling of 3,830 common wombats in 2018, government data shows. Common wombats are more abundant than southern hairy-nosed wombats. “There’s simply no excuse for this over-the-top lethal intervention, particularly considering simple solutions to prevent damage such as wombat gates are now available,” said Evan Quartermain from the Humane Society International. “That these latest allegations of wombats being shot are on the Yorke Peninsula is particularly concerning. It’s a highly fragmented population, and Point Pearce is one of just three colonies thought to have more than 100 individuals. It’s an area of great conservation significance.” Quartermain said legal wildlife culling, authorised by state governments, was “occurring at extremely alarming levels nationwide”. The southern hairy-nosed wombat was nominated for threatened species listing several times under the Environment Protections and Biosecurity Conservation Act, but is not currently listed. Quartermain said the Humane Society was in the process of renominating the species, which is under threat from Sarcoptic mange and habitat loss. The Yorke Peninsula population is the smallest of the four main wild populations, which include the Eyre Peninsula and Murraylands and the largest population of between 50,000 to 100,000 wombats on the Nullarbor plain in SA and Western Australia. Estimates from 2014 put the population on the Yorke Peninsula at just 696 wombats spread over 25 colonies, of which Point Pearce is the largest with 135 individuals. A native title determination confirming Narungga rights over the Yorke Peninsula, including Point Pearce, is scheduled for a federal court hearing in June. The Point Pearce office of the Aboriginal Lands Trust told Guardian Australia on Monday it was not commenting on the issue."
"When Doug Paton burst from his trailer on a warm spring afternoon, he expected to confront yet another stray dog agitating the livestock on his sister’s farm outside Victoria, a city on Canada’s west coast. Instead, standing barefoot in the grass, he found himself face to face with a wolf. “It stopped dead in its tracks and it stared me down,” he says. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the wolf trotted away, pausing once to stare back at Paton before clearing a five-foot metal gate and vanishing. “Just like a person, you might not remember a name, but you never forget a face,” he says. “I’ll never forget that face as long as I live. I just close my eyes and see it.” After leaving a breathless Paton back in 2012, the young wolf traversed nearly 25 miles of urban sprawl, taking shelter in the backyards and parks of British Columbia’s capital, until he reached the south-east tip of Vancouver Island. From there, the wolf swam nearly two miles towards a scattering of tiny islands within sight of the city. In the eight years that followed, the wolf – named Takaya (the Lekwungen word for wolf) by the Songhees, a local First Nation whose territory encompasses the islands – quickly became a legendary figure, drawing fans from around the world captivated by stories of the resilience – and tenderness – of the young predator. But his life ended in tragedy on Tuesday, in a series of events that laid bare both the cold uncertainties of life in the wild and the limits of an often-strained bond between humans and wild animals. Tayaka was a rare species of canine known as the coastal or sea wolf. These predators thrive in marine environments and have become adept at living off a diet of salmon, shellfish and seals instead of deer. Fifty years ago, there were few coastal wolves in the region, victims of overhunting and habitat degradation. Today an estimated 250 of them roam the 12,000 sq miles of Vancouver Island, a remarkable turnaround for the embattled predators. Two years after Paton’s experience, Cheryl Alexander got her first glimpse of Takaya, in May 2014. Like many of the 370,000 residents of greater Victoria, the environmental consultant and photographer was curious about how the wolf could survive among the wind-battered trees of the tiny islands. She saw Takaya emerge from the ocean briefly and slip into the trees. The piercing howls that followed were a chilling and powerful experience. “It had emotions associated with it that were very melodic,” she says. “Everyone was almost moved to tears.” Much of the excitement surrounding Takaya came from the unlikeliness of his journey. Few wolves have ever traversed the heart of Victoria, and the islands Takaya took up residence on were tiny, 10 times smaller than the narrowest known range for a wolf pack in the wild. Most notably, he arrived alone. Wolves almost always live in nuclear families; two parents and their pups. Occasionally, one will break away to form a new group. But the dangers of hunting – the sharp antlers and stomping hoofs of panicking animals – are often fatal for a lone predator. That Takaya travelled solo – and seemed content to remain alone – added to the myth and excitement. In recent years, new housing developments have marched steadily outwards from Victoria, swapping land that was once forested and wild for cul-de-sacs and two-car garages. But the chain of islands close to the city is a rare enclave of untamed nature. Pine and fir, punctuated by the rich amber hues of arbutus trees, create thick inland forests. Seals haul themselves on to the shores and small mammals – mink and otter – scurry among the rocks. Takaya quickly got to work, feasting on the seals and otters and sharpening his ability to catch fast-moving fish. But with no permanent streams on the island, he also had to use his ingenuity to survive. Drizzly winters created temporary wetlands, but summers in the region are dry. In a move that astounded biologists, he began digging wells on the island. “He really pushed the envelope of what’s possible ecologically, both in terms of how he made his living, and the small amount of space that he actually required to do so,” says Chris Darimont, a wolf expert at the University of Victoria and the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Takaya was an “extreme data point” on the spectrum of anything researchers had previously encountered. People began paddling out to the islands, hoping to catch a glimpse of this miraculous wolf thriving in the ever-vanishing wild around them. But as his popularity grew, fed by a steady flow of stories in the local media, government authorities feared a dangerous encounter with humans had become inevitable and in the summer of 2012 and winter of 2013, conservation officers set up a series of traps. But Takaya seemed untrappable, ignoring the bait laid out for him. Plans to capture Takaya put the province at odds with the Songhees First Nations, who vigorously protested the idea of removing the wolf. Long a symbol of the Lekwungen people, there was an excitement among the community that a wolf had finally returned. Resistance to capturing the wolf also unearthed longstanding grievances over control of the islands. Known as Ti’ches in Lekwungen, the archipelago has long been a source of natural medicines found in the woods and fish in the surrounding waters. When the colonial government enacted a ban on traditional indigenous ceremonies in the 1800s, the Songhees would travel to Ti’ches to practise in secret. Archival photographs show large wooden structures along the shore, all of which have long disappeared; dismantled, destroyed or stolen over the years. Today the Songhees own all of Chatham Islands and share a portion of Discovery Island with the province of British Columbia. But even the name of the area – Oak Bay Islands Ecological Reserve – remains a vestige of colonialism. “There’s a huge piece of culture that’s not known or appreciated,” says Mark Salter, the former tourism manager for the Songhees Nation, who has worked to educate the public about the history of the islands. On numerous occasions, he has had to put out fires left by campers and pick up garbage left on the shore. “People invite themselves out here, not knowing this is reserve land. But they’re not welcome.” In 2016, a group ignored a ban on bringing pets to the islands, travelling with their two dogs. As they walked through the forest, they soon realised they had acquired a third canine in their group. The group panicked and scrambled on to the roof of a nearby lighthouse building, where they called coastguard rescue. Armed conservation officers also arrived, prepared to deliver a fatal shot if needed. Takaya was spared, but the encounter chilled Salter, who worried the wolf’s fame, which only increased over time, could be his undoing. Howls still echoing in her mind, Alexander began boating around the islands, eager to repeat her first encounter. This time she came prepared with telephoto lenses. Her early sightings of Takaya were rare and infrequent. He was ghostlike, quickly vanishing from view. “There was something very captivating about him,” she says. “For whatever reason, I felt a really intense connection. I just wanted to learn about his life.” She returned to the islands week after week. With permission from the Songhees Nation, Alexander was able to set foot in the forests where Takaya often hid. Walking gingerly among the pine and fir, she could sense his presence, even as he remained camouflaged among the trees and tall grass. He began appearing – and vanishing – more frequently. In their hundreds of encounters – including one in which he sat just three feet from her – Alexander felt drawn to his tenderness. “Wolves want what we want,” she says. “They play. They touch. They care deeply about other members of their family.” It was these human-like characteristics that moved people the most. His lonely howls could often be heard from the city during calm weather. Wolves, like humans, crave companionship in some form. As Takaya aged, outliving most wild wolves, he did so alone. No wolf had ever been recorded living alone for so long, says Darimont. And lone wolves typically avoid howling, so as not to draw the attention of nearby packs. Nearly everything about Takaya, it seemed, was exceptional. In 2019, a documentary featuring Takaya that Alexander helped produce aired in Canada and on the BBC, further cementing his fame. Then, in February 2019, a lone female was spotted on the rocky shores of the mainland, across from where Takaya made his swim. Experts doubt she swam the channel – but her presence ignited hope that Takaya might soon be reunited with one of his own. “There was something about his aloneness … his alienation from his own kind … that spoke to people’s own feelings of alienation and aloneness in the world,” says Alexander. “Plus, we’re all hopeless romantics.” Others found strength in the wolf’s solitude. Paton, whose spring encounter in 2012 was likely the first recorded sighting of Takaya, was locked in a bitter custody battle and divorce when the two crossed paths. “I didn’t want to fight any more. And then I saw this lone wolf and thought, ‘If he’s healthy – if he’s doing fine by himself, then so can I,’” he says. “From that day forward, I just changed my attitude towards things. I stopped feeling sorry for myself. I felt more invigorated than ever to get things right in my life. And I never looked back.” Soon after, Paton had the words “Lone Wolf” tattooed on his forearms in permanent tribute. With all the success Takaya had enjoyed on the islands, no one is sure why, on 25 January this year, he dipped his 10-year-old body into the swirling emerald waters one last time and swam towards the city. Emerging from the ocean on the opposite shore, he was greeted by a scene of parks and forest, interrupted by condominiums and family homes. Darimont believes the most likely reason, despite the popular conception of Takaya as a lonely figure, was that he was overcome by the annual hormonal urge to mate, which occurs in January. “I suspect he gave up tranquil retirement on the islands to go find a mate,” he says. Conservation officers have their own theories. They believe a string of intense storms in the winter months, which had blown fierce winds across the islands, might have disrupted Takaya’s access to food. The greenery of city parks across the water and the potential of a new source of food might have been enough to lure a hungry wolf. Alexander, however, rejects mating and food loss as likely explanations for Takaya’s journey. In the days leading up to his departure, trail camera images showed a healthy, robust wolf. And if the previous nine years of hormones hadn’t been enough to move him from the island in search of a mate, she wondered why – at nearly 11 years old – he suddenly felt the urge to leave. Instead, she feared he might have misjudged the swift ocean currents and been swept towards the mainland. Or that the sound of poachers on the island – hunting ducks in the winter – might have prompted the skittish wolf to seek refuge in the water. “I doubt that he was intending to leave permanently. I just can’t see it. It was his territory. It was really the only thing he knew. He’d been there all of his life,” she says. For nearly 48 hours, Takaya, briskly trotting through parks and along sidewalks, led police on a wild chase through the city. The city remained transfixed as police posted the wolf’s progress on social media. Alexander remembers a night riddled with anxiety as she received constant updates on the chase. Eventually police tracked Takaya to a house, finding him wedged between a garage and a fence. Alexander pleaded with officials to let her see Takaya, but was held back. “I was nearby and I believe that he could smell me,” she s ays. Takaya was sedated and carried upside down, his tongue hanging from the side of his mouth, and placed into a metal barrel. After snapping photos of his limp body being carried away, Alexander returned home to celebrate her husband’s birthday and then went to bed. “The next morning, I just woke up, and cried,” she says. Two days later Takaya was released back into the wild, emerging from the stupor of drugs on a gravel logging road. Conservation officers decided to relocate him more than 100 miles from the islands. He was moved inland, where the forest is thick and impenetrable, along the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island. Away from the familiarity and comforts of his small islands, Takaya faced a daunting list of new threats. Packs of wolves in the area might kill him if their paths crossed. Leg-hold traps, laden with bait, might prove too tempting to a starving wolf. Even the new prey – elk and deer – were unfamiliar. “There was tons of stuff that he hadn’t had to deal with in his life,” says Alexander. “I was very worried.” “Nature is nature and you can’t predict what’s going to happen,” said conservation officer Mark Kissinger, who tranquillised Takaya and set him free, at the time. “But hopefully things go well for him.” Each time she visited the islands in the weeks that followed, Alexander was struck by an overwhelming sense of emptiness. “There’s an absence now of energy. There’s an absence of possibility,” she said, steering her boat through a narrow channel one sunny February afternoon. “He gave us a portal into the wild and into nature – and into something that we often don’t get to see. And if we do, it’s only just a glimpse.” Then, at the end of February, Alexander received an email from a woman who had spotted a wolf while out walking near the fishing community of Port Renfrew. It had peered at her from the forest and showed no signs of aggression when her dog approached it. Alexander travelled to meet the woman but returned home without any sightings. Then, that night, she was sent a photograph from a man who had a series of trail cameras in the area. Alexander took one look at the picture, and recognised Takaya. A bright yellow tag was pinned in his ear – a souvenir from his experience with conservation officers. Alexander travelled back to Port Renfrew, this time bringing her own trail camera. Checking it a few days later, the video showed Takaya walking past. The sighting, so close to a populated area, immediately concerned Alexander. “He doesn’t have that fear instilled in him that humans are bad. He’s trusting. It worries me he may find himself in a situation where humans are not all good and don’t have his interests at heart. It really scares me; it worries me,” said Alexander following the sightings. Her instincts proved right. On 24 March, Takaya was shot and killed, nearly 30 miles from where he was released. In the weeks before his death he had been spotted with increasing frequency, raising fears an encounter might prove fatal. On his final day he came too close to a hunter’s dogs. In the end, it was his curiosity, built up from years of protection offered by the islands, that was his undoing. British Columbia’s Conservation Officer Service told Canada’s CTV news: “We understand many British Columbians and people around the world shared care and concern for the wellbeing of this wolf and this update will affect many people.” None more so than Alexander, who said simply: “It’s heartbreaking.”"
"Heading down through fields towards oak, ash and hazel copses along the Afon Artro, past impenetrable ramparts of gorse, I heard a familiar, delicate song. “A prolonged trill, low and aërial” is how WH Hudson, the most scrupulously observant of all avian writers, describes it. I scarcely needed to look around before an eccentrically scattering quiver of exquisite small birds hurled past me to settle momentarily and search for insects among bare, dark-budded twigs of the ash trees. A moment later, and as though at a signal, the acrobatic throng swirled high like leaves on an eddying wind and was gone. Long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus). “Bum-barrels” as John Clare knew them. I’m never sure whether that term applied to the birds themselves or more properly to the artistic masterpieces that are their nests. They are utterly endearing little creatures. Along with the goldcrest, they rank by weight as the tiniest of British birds (though that disproportionate tail gives a slightly false impression of their real size, as does the fluffiness of their pastel-tinged plumage). Their relationship to other tits is not close (larks, warblers and swallows also belong to the same large family). But their behaviour – the communal groups, the incessant activity – is distinctly tit-like. Those fist-sized, barrel-shaped nests are marvellous creations. It speaks volumes for Clare’s attentiveness to the natural world that he was well acquainted with them. Occasionally you see them high in the fork of a tree, but more often they’re concealed well within the densest thickets of gorse or blackthorn. They are constructed from moss, wool and feathers, decorated with scales of lichen, and bound together with gossamer. To see one with eight or 10 gaping maws clamouring for food at the entrance is one of the most pleasing and intimate sights in nature, and one of the hardest to locate. You need to study their comings and goings in May or June, then find a good angle to train your glass on the thicket to which they’re bound. Keep well away and watch as the whole family group assists in the feeding. All this as outcome of that sweet music in the cold of early spring."
"As he clambers down the forested ravine, soil slipping beneath his boots, Dr Fred Nizeyimana knows they are close. “I can smell them,” he says, just before the mountain gorillas come into view high in the canopy, plucking leaves and chomping on the vegetation. An adult female slides down a tree, a flash of black fur and elongated limb. More follow, with infants and juveniles in tow. A grunting silverback descends to join its family, the branches buckling beneath approximately 180kg (400lb) of iconic primate. Then Nizeyimana, a specialist vet offering hands-on care in the wild, spots a remarkable scene. Ambling up the steep, wooded slope, another gorilla family has emerged from the valley floor. The first group look on, then head deeper into the primeval jungle of Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable national park – one of Africa’s most ancient habitats and home to almost half of the world’s mountain gorillas. Such a close and well-populated encounter with one of humankind’s nearest relatives (witnessed before the Covid-19 pandemic) would have been inconceivable during the dark days of the early 1980s, when it was estimated that there were only 250 mountain gorillas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) Virunga national park, and around 100 thought to be in Bwindi. That all-time low prompted fears they would vanish by the end of the 20th century. Even in early 2018, the conservation status of these gorillas put them one step away from extinction. Now, thanks to a far-reaching initiative, a recent census has revealed the number of known mountain gorillas has increased to 1,063 – taking them off the red list of critically endangered species. Amid climate chaos and unbridled habitat destruction, this is a momentous achievement, albeit one that could now be reversed by the coronavirus pandemic. Experts who led the revival put their success down to engaging local communities, securing government support and promoting transnational collaboration, a three-pronged strategy that could offer beleaguered areas worldwide a roadmap to recovery. “When done well, this can be a phenomenal success,” says Dr Timothy Tear, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Africa programme, which has been involved in the decades-long campaign to save the mountain gorilla. “We need to be recognising there are many more opportunities to do things like this in other countries.” Environmentalists stress the importance of giving local communities a stake in the survival of the local area, ensuring they profit from ecotourism and other money-making activities that provide alternatives to hunting and resource exploitation. These income streams can fuel a country’s economic vitality, winning state support by helping to assert the animals’ worth to policymakers in capitals far from wilderness areas. “The revenue that mountain gorillas produce is a major reason why governments are valuing this resource,” says Tear. Permits to visit gorillas for one hour start at $600 (£479) per person in Uganda, rising to $1,500 in Rwanda. These sums are eye-watering, but crucial. Worldwide, up to $400bn a year is needed to conserve healthy ecosystems, a Credit Suisse report estimates, a long way from the $52bn actually raised. Mountain gorilla habitats span Rwanda, Uganda and the war-wracked DRC, so partnerships unconstrained by political frontiers are essential. Such “conservation diplomacy” played out in 2015 when the three countries signed a treaty committing to coordinate the conservation of the region. “Not any one country could have, on its own, been responsible for the recovery,” says Anna Behm Masozera, director of the IGCP, a regional coalition of environmental groups. But serious threats remain, from irresponsible development to climate change – and now Covid-19. Our simian ancestors share about 98% of human DNA and can catch respiratory diseases from people, with deadly consequences. Leading scientists warned last month that Covid-19 poses an “existential threat” to primates and that, for mountain gorillas in particular, the introduction of a new, highly-infectious disease could be a “potential extinction-level event”. In response, rangers in Bwindi are now required to wear face masks, use hand sanitiser and keep their distance from the apes. The suspension of ecotourism during the coronavirus pandemic has also meant the main source of revenue for gorilla conservation has been lost and there are fears some of those in surrounding communities who depend on tourists could turn to poaching out of desperation. “We are worried,” says Bashir Hangi, a spokesman for the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the state body that manages Bwindi and nine other national parks. “If this continues, it’s definitely going to reverse the achievements. There’s no doubt about it.” Ever since a young military officer named Oscar von Beringe discovered mountain gorillas (then promptly shot two of them) in 1902, these magnificent mammals have endured persecution. Disease, hunting and habitat destruction have blighted their two populations, split between Bwindi in Uganda and the Virunga range of extinct volcanoes that straddle DRC, Rwanda and Uganda.  It was in 1979 that conservation groups first started collaborating to protect the dwindling population, founding the Mountain Gorilla Project to run tourism and education initiatives to change local attitudes. But gorilla numbers continued to drop, whether they were dying in traps intended for antelope, or being killed in retaliation for raiding crops. Grisly trinkets made from their hands and heads were sold in tourist markets. The legendary primatologist Dian Fossey began using uncompromising methods to pull these critically-endangered creatures back from the brink, from repelling herders by spray-painting cattle to directly confronting poachers, many of whom were impoverished locals with few options. In 1985, a few weeks before her 54th birthday, Fossey was murdered in Rwanda. Her killers were never found. Shortly before her murder, Fossey had said she feared there would be no mountain gorillas left within 15 years. But a census one year after her death revealed the opposite; numbers were increasing. “There was a glimmer of success,” says Behm Masozera, the IGCP’s director. “In order to sustain that success, a more cohesive programme was built around it.” This resulted in the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) – a coalition of nonprofits comprising Conservation International, Fauna & Flora International and WWF that was more formalised than the Mountain Gorilla Project, with a remit across DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. This long-term alliance, argues one member, should be replicated elsewhere. “This is entirely the way we need to be working,” says Cath Lawson, regional conservation manager for Africa at WWF-UK, “to have that transformational change for wildlife like mountain gorillas to thrive.” In 2003, despite DRC’s protracted conflict and the earlier horrors of the Rwandan genocide, sustained efforts had increased Virunga’s population to 380. An additional 320 in the cloud forests of Bwindi brought the total population to 700 individuals. The upward trajectory continued, propelled by 2015’s intergovernmental treaty. Snares, fashioned from ropes or wires that cut deep into gorilla flesh, began to disappear. In November 2018, the subspecies was upgraded from critically endangered to endangered, having surpassed 1,000 individuals. By the end of 2019, the number of known mountain gorillas reached 1,063. But there is no room for complacency. “Yes, this demonstrates what we can achieve,” says Lawson. “But it’s not a done deal.” Ecotourism has played a central role in this conservation triumph, alongside a scheme that splits the revenue with nearby communities, adapting earlier divisive models of “fortress conservation” into something more inclusive and equitable. Undeniably, though, coercive methods to protect wildlife have devastated traditional life for Batwa “pygmies”, a forest-dependent indigenous minority who were evicted in their thousands from Bwindi and other Ugandan parks as protection activities ramped up in the early 1990s and continue to suffer today. Yet other local communities hail the Bwindi project – and its pragmatic fusion of wealth creation with environmentalism – as a genuine gain. The Change A Life Bwindi charity trains former poachers in beekeeping, mothers in basket weaving, and teenage girls unable to afford school in tailoring. These income-generating activities emphasise the advantages of living near a thriving gorilla population to which cash-rich westerners are drawn daily. “We see Bwindi as a good thing,” says Hilda Ariho, a 30-year-old community leader. “It brings tourists here and without it we’d be poorer. It’s helping a lot of women.” Back inside the park, after Nizeyimana spots the two gorilla families, a group of tourists have one hour to absorb the scene, whether by taking a slew of selfies or observing in quiet contemplation. The tourists depart and the silverback reclines, watching over his relatives in a mountainous landscape that for approximately 25,000 years has woven itself into an awe-inspiring tangle of vines, trunks and creepers across the Albertine Rift valley.  Conservationists are hoping that these mountain gorillas continue to thrive and that the latest threat, Covid-19, can be beaten.

"Ten years ago, James Rogers was driving through some of the most productive farmland on the planet, thinking about food. He had recently read an article detailing the challenges of feeding the world’s growing population, and as he gazed out over the fertile fields of the Salinas Valley outside Monterey, California, he thought: how is it possible that people go hungry, that people starve, when growing food seems so simple? “You just take these magic beans and...” Rogers, recalling the thought, casts his hand as if tossing seed on the ground. “I realise it’s a bit more complicated than that, but, still…” Back then, Rogers was a PhD student in material sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He wasn’t working in anything food-related at all. His PhD research involved creating a kind of paint that, when dried, turned into a solar panel. There was a lab up in Berkeley that had the equipment necessary for his studies, but between the lab and his home in Santa Barbara, he passed the farmland, and the food problem gnawed at him. He wondered if it wasn’t merely as simple as he supposed. He began taking classes in environmental economics and natural resources. He learned that, globally, we are indeed producing more than enough food. The problem isn’t production, it’s what happens next. We waste an extraordinary amount of food. In America it’s about 40%; in the UK, nearly the same. Around the world, almost a third of all the food produced – approximately 1.3bn tonnes – is lost one way or another each year. Much of the time it’s not merely lost, but brought into our homes only to be chucked in the bin, and then transported to a landfill, where it slowly releases methane back into the atmosphere, actively warming the Earth. Worldwide, a staggering 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. The question for Rogers was: what exactly was driving so much waste? One day, while researching, he came across another article. He can still recall its first line: “All fresh produce is seasonal as well as perishable.” That insight – so simple, so true – struck him like a lightning bolt. “The problem,” he recalls, “is you’re either in season and have more than you know what to do with, or you have nothing.” Plenty of animals have adapted to these natural cycles of boom and bust, fat times and lean: birds migrate, bears hibernate. Humans trade, converting this surplus into a non-perishable asset we call money. Some of the earliest forms of currency were, in fact, grains stored in clay pots. And clay pottery, Rogers is quick to point out, was one of material science’s very first breakthroughs. Clay pottery allowed us to continue eating long after the harvest. But clay pottery only got us so far. It was what material science might offer food today that interested him. He decided, then, to switch tracks. No longer would he work on paint that dried into solar panels. He would instead begin to work on increasing the shelf life of fruit and vegetables. Eventually, he developed a substance that wasn’t entirely dissimilar from the solar paint. This substance, however, was made entirely out of plant lipids, or fatty acids. Spray it on to an avocado, say, and the substance dries into a sort of second skin, which increases the avocado’s shelf life by two to three times. The company Rogers founded, Apeel Sciences, is currently growing by hundreds of employees a year, backed by tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and is revolutionising entire food systems and economies. But back then, in 2010, driving past those fertile fields, it was still early days. Rogers remembers calling his mother and telling her the news about his insight – the big switch in his interests and research. “Sweetie,” she said to him. “That sounds really nice. But you don’t know anything about fruit and vegetables.” Apeel Sciences is headquartered in Goleta, California, just north of UCSB and south of farmland that quickly gives way to the rural, rolling Central California coast. The company’s 100,000 sq ft building was formerly home to a medical-device maker and the labs and clean rooms easily swapped from their previous purpose – building prototypes for entry into the human body – to their current one: the study of the molecular structures of fruit’s skin. “This room is part of our food-manufacturing practice,” says Molly Greathouse, who is giving me a tour. We peer in, but the lab is dark and empty and appears abandoned. “It’s still being set up,” she says. “We’re still putting wires into things.” Her colleague, Daniel Costanza, is my other guide. Both are recent hires, but recent is relative: Apeel’s employee count rose in the past six months from 130 to more than 200, so Greathouse, who has been here for nearly a year-and-a-half, counts as a seasoned veteran. We pass another lab, a clean room that houses, among other bacteria, E coli and listeria. The lights are on, and along one wall is another big door topped by a glowing red light. Here, Greathouse says, is where Apeel’s scientists put fruit and vegetables through a battery of tests mimicking conditions they might face while in transit. What happens when refrigeration shuts down? What happens when a contaminated batch of food is nearby, hence the reason for the dangerous bacteria. There are cascading effects to prolonging the shelf life of produce. Costanza describes how one of the suppliers they work with no longer uses plastic wrap on cucumbers now that Apeel’s spray is in the mix. It’s a seemingly small change that quickly adds up. In a single year, that one move will save enough plastic wrap to enfold the Empire State Building 11 times over. “Imagine adding that to each food category throughout the globe,” Costanza says. “That’s a huge paradigm shift away from single-use plastics. It’s pretty crazy.” Costanza drops his voice, getting serious. “This is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet. There are so many lives we can affect in a positive way. And we have such tight intellectual property no one’s really able to replicate it – we don’t really have competition.” They do, really. There’s Hazel Technologies, which is based in Chicago and makes little packets that get stashed in produce boxes. The packets alter the atmosphere within the box, slowing the food’s response to ethylene, a chemical that fruit and vegetables emit as they age that causes a breakdown in colour and texture. A similar company in the UK, called It’s Fresh, makes ethylene filters, too, and recently received a $10m investment from AgroFresh, a company that sells a dozen or so products including fungicides and wax coatings, all of which aim to prolong produce shelf life and enhance their look. There’s also Cambridge Crops, from Massachusetts, which makes a similar edible protective coating to Apeel, using silk proteins rather than plant lipids. Cambridge Crops received $4m in seed funding from the MIT venture fund last year, whereas Apeel recently landed $70m from the Silicon Valley fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has famously backed Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb and Soylent, the meal-replacement drink company. All of these companies and investors are making a play for a market worth at least $218bn in the US, and several times that worldwide. That number – $218bn – is about how much grocery stores, restaurants and people at home spend on food that simply gets thrown away per year, according to ReFed, a food waste-reduction nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. ReFed also estimates that, last year, venture capitalists invested about $185m in technologies to combat food waste. People have been trying to preserve fruit and vegetables for at least as long as they’ve been putting grains in clay pots. We dry it in the sun (12,000 BC) or jam it (600 AD) or cure it (1400 AD), or cool it or can it, pasteurise it or vacuum seal it. The practice of coating a fruit in wax to seal its freshness and enhance its appearance is at least several centuries old, and today you’d be hard pressed to find a supermarket apple without it. Today, wax seals also contain antifungal properties, which are perfectly safe, and are applied in so thin a layer as to be pretty much insignificant. What sets Apeel apart is its specific coating technology – the fact that it works more effectively than a wax and is an organic additive made from plant parts. That, and the company’s comparatively huge cash influx from Silicon Valley, and its truly global reach. Apeel is already well on its way to spanning the globe. It has satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey, and it works with five different suppliers of avocados, including Del Monte and Del Rey, which are two of the largest. It also works with Sage Fruit, one of Washington state’s largest organic apple growers. Greathouse and Costanza shepherd me past the analytical sciences lab, where the fruit is run through a series of taste and smell tests to make sure that the Apeel spray essentially disappears as soon as it’s applied. This is a complex task. The spray can be made of the lipids from any plant – much of the source crop for their ingredients changes throughout the year, and is simply the excess or discarded produce from farms and vineyards – but it has to be molecularly reconstituted to act more or less exactly like the specific fruit on which it is sprayed. We arrive at yet another lab, this one home to the material sciences team – the beating heart of the Apeel operation. Here, they use liquid gases to separate specific molecules from the lipid slurry, then reconfigure those molecules into a variety of combinations, essentially highly educated hunches as to what a specific fruit or vegetable’s skin might be like. If this seems like a lot of tedious guesswork, it is. The research and development for Apeel’s first product, a coating for avocados, took eight years. Now we’re in a bright room lined with racks of mouldering strawberries and bananas. Well, some are mouldering, some are not. Each rack has a camera mounted and set to a timer, to scan the fruit and track its breakdown. Some of the fruit has been sprayed with the Apeel spray, some has not. Tim, an engineer and overseer of the rotting fruit, apologises for the fruit fly situation in the room. Finally, our tour ends in a warehouse at the back of the building. The space is dominated by huge produce sorting and cleaning machines, rigged with a custom-made Apeel spray device that treats the fruit or vegetables at the very last step of the process. “It feels like moisturiser,” Greathouse says, describing the spray. It is odourless and tasteless, too. Once, when Greathouse tried some of it on her hand, she thought, “Maybe I can shave with this.” In fact, she adds, “The reason we wrinkle is oxidation and moisture loss – same as fruit. I want to do an experiment with one half of my face on Apeel, one half not, and then see what happens.” James Rogers, the CEO, has an office filled with avocados. Some are pillows, some figurines, some are squishy stress balls shaped like avocados, some are the genuine article. Rogers loves avos. “The joke with the av is: not now, not now, not now. Now? Too late,” he says. But: “When you get an Apeel avocado the joke no longer makes sense,” because the fruit stays ripe for so long. The window to enjoy it, previously so fleeting, has been stretched by weeks. The one fruit he loves even more, though, is the strawberry. “I know it’s not sexy, but it’s just my favourite,” he says. “And they go bad so quickly.” The company is a few years into R&D on that one. “When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that’s when I know we’ll have made it.” These days, Rogers spends less time in material science and more on distribution chains. It turns out, when you create a new technology that extends the shelf life of produce, it creates another problem central to the whole business: who, exactly, does this create value for? The perishability of a fruit or veg dictates everything about its supply chain. Everything from when you pick it, right down to the season and the time of the day, to where it’s packed, in the field or a packing shed. Is it then force air-cooled, or hydro-cooled? Does it travel down a flume or a conveyor belt? Does it go in a bag? Or does it get boxed? Does it go in a box with big holes or small holes? Does it go into a shipping container? Does it go into an aeroplane? Does it go into a display in the grocery store? When it goes home with you, does it go in the fridge? Or does it go on your counter? Within every supply chain for every different fruit or vegetable lies economic opportunity. The goal for each of Apeel’s produce lines, Rogers says, is that the savings accrued by the growers or grocers are so great that you and I are actually paying less for their fruit and vegetables in the market. This is crucial, because – yes – while it’s good for the environment and will cut down on waste, feeling good about what you buy can only rope in so many consumers; the rest, the real revolution, lies in sheer economic price cutting. A cheaper piece of fruit that will last four times as long? No one will pass that bargain up. Where things start to get truly interesting, from a market perspective, is how this opens up whole new avenues of produce to put in front of people. Just as perishability dictates everything about its supply chain, how well a fruit or vegetable travels is the most important characteristic of any mass-produced produce. The best example of this is the banana. Nearly every banana sold in supermarkets is a variety called the Cavendish. The Cavendish isn’t particularly tasty, as banana varieties go. Nor is it especially packed with nutrients. There are far better bananas out there. But none travel – stay firm and unripe quite as long – like the Cavendish. Only, the Cavendish is falling victim to its own success, and a fungus is rampaging through this particular variety. So diversity in our produce isn’t just a nice thing for us as eaters, it’s essential for our future food security. Just up the road from Apeel’s headquarters is a farm growing a strange kind of finger-shaped lime. When cut open, the flesh appears pearled, like caviar, which is why it’s known as a caviar lime. The farm’s caviar limes are a speciality item, trucked to high-end restaurants in LA and flown to New York for the same purpose. The limes last for 7-10 days after they’ve been picked. But Apeel started working with the farm a few years ago, and was able to develop a spray that worked. A fruit with a shorter window of ripeness actually speeds up the development process, because you are able to quickly see what’s working, and what’s not. Now this fruit that was so highly specialised, appearing for just one weekend in a farmer’s market, and in a few dishes in fancy restaurants, can be sold in supermarkets. The caviar limes weren’t Rogers’ idea. Some of his scientists became infatuated with the problem and went to work on it. But now, he sees how this might be the future: new fruit and heirloom vegetables: the weirder, more specialised, small-batch stuff, brought to the masses. The weird limes were actually the very first product Apeel brought to the market. “Thank God no one listened to me on that one,” he says, smiling, thinking back on it. It taught him another important lesson, one he carries forward now. “The shorter the shelf life, the bigger the opportunity.”"
"Eight years ago Tom Ogren, a horticulturist, was in Sacramento, California, when he noticed that the ground around the State Capitol building was covered in thick yellow pollen. Scanning the trees along the street with his binoculars, he saw the trees were all deodar cedars (Cedrus deodara) and all cultivated males. Naturally, the deodar is monoecious, having both male and female cones growing on the same tree. But cultivation has produced wholly male trees – plants favoured by planners since they have no seeds or pods to drop but only pollen. This was the case at this Sacramento site, Ogren said. Growers’ breeding of purely male diodar trees had created, said Ogren, “something that doesn’t even exist in nature”. Ogren said he had seen similar pollen-coated cityscapes in Christchurch, New Zealand, London, UK, and all over Canada. “Everywhere I’ve gone, same situation,” he said. Male trees are often favoured by urban landscape planners as female trees can shed fruit as well as seeds and pods. Pollen producing trees that are dioecious (with male and female flowers on separate plants) are seen to add to the effect of allergies of city dwellers . Today, hay fever affects more than 400 million people worldwide. More than 300 million people have asthma, often an effect of hay fever, and that number is expected to rise by 100 million by 2025. Allergenic tree pollen was found to be one of the biggest contributors to hay fever and asthma, and pollen counts have also been rising over the past 15 years. This health issue is going largely unaddressed despite there being a simple solution: a bigger mix of male and female trees in urban areas. While some cities were beginning to catch on, Ogren said, getting the methodology widely adopted was an uphill battle. He began researching allergenic plants and trees more than 30 years ago, when, with his wife, he moved to San Luis Obispo, California. His wife developed terrible allergies, he said. After studying the flora in their neighbourhood he understood the reason – all the tree species were males. Trees can be one of three sexes – monecious, dioecious male or dioecious female. Naturally, there is a relatively even split between all three, so the amount of pollen wafted into the air is regulated. But when dioecious males are planted independently of dioecious females, as often the case in urban areas, their pollen is unchecked by any capture by female flowers. Landscape plans of cities across the US revealed the planting pattern to Ogren. When he dug deeper he found a note in the 1949 USDA Yearbook of Agriculture reading: “When used for street plantings only male trees should be selected, to avoid the nuisance from the seed.” He said it was “botanical sexism”. Ogren added that when Dutch elm disease wiped out a portion of America’s elm trees in the late 1960s urban landscapers ordered more than 100 varieties of male maple clones as replacements; then other male varieties followed. Since cloning proved quicker than waiting for trees to pollinate and grow naturally, male clones began to dominate the tree nurseries too. It was not just in the US. Ogren saw the same trend wherever he travelled. By 2000 Ogren had collected so much data on tree species he was able to create his Ogren Plant Allergy Scale (Opals). It was the first numerical ranking system in existence for plant allergies. It is now used by the USDA Urban and Community Forestry programme to develop allergy rankings in large US cities. Nigel Clarke, one of the UK’s largest distributors of female trees, met Ogren at a plant workshop in Guernsey and they began to help each other with a mutual mission – mitigation of urban tree pollen. “If plant distributors, by their plant choices, are responsible for the rising numbers of allergy sufferers in urban areas, then we, by making the correct plant choices, can at least reduce the amount of allergenic pollen in the air,” said Clarke. Now, he said, he tagged all his trees using Opals to ensure his buyers were better informed. Ogren’s work has also had an impact in several cities in Canada, where he was commissioned to do a tree allergy audit. The town of Hamilton, for example, has adopted more allergy-friendly urban planting policies, largely due to Peter Prakke, a nurseryman who has been advocating allergy-free schoolyards and public parks for the past 10 years, using Ogren’s work as a guide. “Long story short, the school board accepted the Opals concept,” said Prakke “This was the first school board [to do so] in Canada.” Vancouver, Edmonton and Halifax are also working towards balancing their tree populations so as to reduce allergies. But these are only small pockets of success.  Clifford Bassett, founder of Allergy and Asthma Care, of New York, said: “I see a growing number of patients each year who suffer from seasonally triggered allergies. Warmer temperatures, the longer pollen season, and rising carbon dioxide levels are likely to contribute to increasing sensitisation to pollen.” Studies have shown that air pollution particulates attach to pollen grains, which causes the powdery substance to shatter into still tinier pieces. “When that happens the inside of the pollen grain is exposed and that’s 10 times more allergenic than the outside,” explained Ogren. Higher CO2 levels also cause plants to bloom more, which means even higher pollen counts where predominantly male trees reside. If cities do not take action to slow this snowball effect, “we’re coming up with a recipe for terrible [allergy] disasters in the future”, said Ogren. Ogren suggested that all sufferers should get together and “demand protection” as “a basic human right”, adding: “We could have pollen-free lawns, hedges, trees, all of this, it’s all doable, but only if enough people know about it and if the right people raise enough fuss about it.”"
"The Queensland government has placed a year-long moratorium on new water mines in parts of the Gold Coast hinterland, where drought-hit residents have been campaigning against the impact of the bottled water industry. Late last year, dozens of bores that supply drinking water to Tamborine Mountain schools, businesses and residents ran dry, with many residents having to wait six weeks for deliveries by truck. The area has three commercial water mines with deep bores that send about 100m litres a year for bottling. Residents told Guardian Australia last year the situation at Tamborine Mountain had become “dire”. There is also growing concern about water extraction plans in the Springbrook Plateau, where two large extraction operations have licences and another was recently blocked by the Gold Coast council. The government’s announcement will prohibit any new commercial bores in the Tamborine Mountain and Springbrook areas for at least the next year. Most of the groundwater extracted at Tamborine – about 84% – is used by farmers. Farmers and households will be exempt from the moratorium. “I appreciate that local residents have concerns about the impact of commercial bottling on groundwater resources at Tamborine and Springbrook,” the Queensland natural resources minister, Anthony Lynham, said. “Good decisions are made on the facts, and we need more facts about how much groundwater is being used, and by whom, to get a clearer picture. “This moratorium will prevent any new developments while the state works with the local councils and the community to identify the best way to manage the areas’ water.” Under the plan, local businesses and farmers will be required to report their water usage to assist in research. The concerns of residents have been compounded by a lack of definitive study about groundwater recharge, which would allow authorities to better understand whether underground supplies are replenished through rainfall. While limited previous research has indicated that commercial water supplies are renewable and the industry is sustainable, the severe impact of the recent drought has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the situation. A 2011 Tamborine Mountain study by researchers at the Queensland University of Technology found that less than 5% of annual groundwater recharge was being extracted.  The study assessed just 50 bores, in a town where many bores are decades-old or not registered, and estimates of the total vary between 500 and 3,000. It noted that “philosophical questions around commercial sale of groundwater [are] very valid but beyond the scope of this report”. Last year the Tamborine Mountain state school ran out of water, and the government had to truck bottles to the community. At the same time, water trucks were carrying local water in the opposite direction."
"Glow-worm numbers have plunged by three-quarters since 2001, research in England has revealed, with the climate crisis a clear factor. The larvae feed on damp-loving snails, and increasingly hot and dry summers mean fewer prey and a greater risk of glow-worms becoming desiccated. Some of the 19 sites studied across Essex are on nature reserves. The data there showed that clearing scrub and coppicing woods to open up ground helped offset glow-worm losses, indicating that conservation action is possible. Glow-worms are small beetles and they exist in small patches across the UK. The females glow green to attract mates. They are wingless, making it hard for them to rebuild lost populations. “Glow-worms were thought to be declining, and probably for several decades now, but there was no hard evidence,” said Tim Gardiner, of the Environment Agency, who led the research. “We have shown a big decline, and at many different sites around Essex. The changing climate has undoubtedly played a role.” This is the first study to provide hard data on long-term changes in the glow-worm populationThe research, published in the journal Insect Conservation and Diversity, used data collected by citizen scientists during nighttime walks in June, July and August each year. “A lot of people are just recording one or two glow-worms when they go out,” Gardiner said. The scientists accounted for changes in weather and the earlier emergence of the glow-worms as the climate heats up to calculate the trend over time. “If they decline like they have declined for the last 18 years, then in another 18 years there are going to be a lot more [local] extinctions,” said Gardiner. Scientists warned in February that “fates of humans and insects are intertwined”, with the huge declines reported in some places only the “tip of the iceberg”. They acknowledge that little is known about most of the estimated 5.5 million insect species but said enough was understood to warrant immediate action. Widespread insect declines threaten a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, with dire consequences for humanity, some scientists have said. Gardiner emphasised the intrinsic wonder of glow-worms. “I still remember when I saw my first one. It was just magical, and every summer I still get a pang of excitement on seeing the first one. Wouldn’t it be sad if there weren’t these things any more?” The glow-worm research was one of a dozen studies published in a special issue of Insect Conservation and Diversity. Many report declines in some – but not all – insects. In the US, scientists compiled sightings of the endangered Poweshiek skipperling butterfly from 1872 to now, showing that its geographic range has shrunk dramatically over time. Evidence from 217 sites shows the butterfly was historically common across the prairies of the upper mid-western US. But populations declined rapidly in the past 20 years as habitat was destroyed, and the butterfly is now extinct at all but five locations. A 20-year study of a threatened flightless longhorn beetle at 13 sites in Switzerland, France and Germany recorded a fall in abundance of 90%, with the intensification of farming the main likely cause. Researchers in the UK using light and suction traps recorded a 30% fall in moth abundance between 1969 and 2016, but found aphid populations remained level. In the Netherlands, light and pitfall traps found declines in abundance of 40-60% among moths, beetles and caddisflies between 1997 and 2017 , but true bugs, mayflies and lacewings did not show similar changes. Prof Raphael Didham, of the University of Western Australia, who edited the special issue of the journal, said: “The problem is clearly global in extent, but the solutions needed are going to be many-fold and range from local individual choices to regional policies that reduce the intensity of human impacts on the environment, and global commitments to maintaining insect biodiversity.” But he said the available data did not in itself constitute evidence for a sudden and catastrophic collapse of all insect populations. “In fact, we need to be equally worried about some examples of insect population increases as well, such as new incursions of invasive species, or cyclical pest outbreaks, and geographic range expansions due to climate change that could disrupt sensitive natural ecosystems,” Didham said. On the plight of glow-worms in England, Gardiner said: “People should visit their local sites and become a champion for glow-worms. They’re not legally protected and by the time they become legally protected, it may be too late.”"
"The pond at the foot of my garden appears devoid of life, its unbroken surface reflecting the dull sky above. Weed hangs motionless and nothing stirs the thin sediment coating sunken leaves in the shallows. Every flooded ditch and waterlogged hollow in my area of west Dartmoor is brimming with gelatinous mounds of frogspawn, eyeballing me from the margins as if it has rained full stops. But my pool, dug with nature in mind, has none. I know that creatures dwell in its muddy depths. A pond is a petri dish of potential, an experiment that generates life with the simple addition of water. Yet today, mine is reluctant to give up its secrets. I put it down to the cold. Eventually I spot something darting up from the darkness. It pierces the flat surface membrane in the blink of an eye, a tiny ripple, and is gone. Another follows, quickly taking on air at the tip of its abdomen before battling buoyancy and furiously paddling down out of sight. Shaped like a seed pod, blackish-brown with gold edging and roughly 35mm long, this is one of our most striking water insects: the great diving beetle (Dytiscus marginalis). A fast and formidable predator, this large beetle hunts any pond dwellers it can grab, whether invertebrates, tadpoles or even small fish. Its carnivorous larvae, armed with sickle-shaped jaws that inject deadly enzymes into prey, are just as fearsome. I manage to scoop out one of the adults with an old rockpooling net for a closer look before returning it unharmed. Well adapted for an aquatic life, they carry oxygen supplies like a scuba diver and swim with feathery rear feet. They are also surprisingly strong fliers, enabling them to colonise new stretches of water, and are widespread in Britain. However, they are not always easy to see, only fleetingly surfacing for air, which they store beneath the rear of their wing cases. At night they are bolder. When I revisit the pond after dark it is transformed. My torch picks out dragonfly larvae, water boatmen, grazing snails, palmate newts and, rowing frantically left and right like wind-up bath toys, three great diving beetles searching for their next meal. "
"The trees on the hill are shaking in the wind. From the top of one of them, somewhere, a woodlark persists with its pretty, lilting song. I look for it, but it must be hidden by branches. About a dozen woodlarks have spent the winter finding food in the field below the visitor centre – along with the finches and buntings – but I expected them to have made their way back to their normal breeding territories on the nearby heathland by now. But here it is, on the edge of the mixed grassland and hedgerow part of the reserve. There have been other local reports of woodlarks singing – unusually – on farmland in recent days, so it will be interesting to see if there is any expansion from heathland to new breeding sites this spring. A chiffchaff chirrups merrily from some bushes lining the track. I wander down to a hide that overlooks the flooded brooks. The tops of fences emerge from the water, the wind whipping it into white waves that flow towards the hide. Birds are hard to find – the ducks and geese are sheltering far away, on the narrow shorelines and on top of the tall flood banks that line the river. High up, the dark arrow of a peregrine falcon flies over, possibly also searching the valley for birds. Round by the northern side of the brooks, where the raised ground and trees provide some shelter, there are more ducks and geese, swimming on the open water and resting in the distant fields. Among them is a group of gleaming white gulls, the adults growing their summer plumage – including two Mediterranean gulls, Larus melanocephalus, whose large, jet-black heads and bright red bills make them stand out among the slightly smaller black-headed gulls. Some Mediterranean gulls overwinter, mostly by the sea, but food – or weather – does bring them further inland. L melanocephalus began breeding in Britain in 1968, regularly since 1979, and numbers of nesting pairs have risen steadily in Sussex, as elsewhere along the coastlines of southern and eastern England and north-western Europe, since 2000. From now on, they’ll become more common at their colonies on the coast as they start to return for the breeding season."
"On a late winter’s afternoon I was watching a sparrowhawk as it soared high above the RSPB’s Ham Wall reserve near Glastonbury, when a larger raptor came into view. For one brief and frantic moment, I thought it was a goshawk; but then I caught sight of the mid-brown plumage and narrow white rump, which marked it out as a female or immature hen harrier – known in birding parlance as a “ringtail”. We don’t see many of these beautiful birds on the Somerset Levels; indeed nowadays, you don’t see many of them anywhere. That’s because hen harriers are still being illegally trapped and shot by gamekeepers on Scottish and English moorlands, to stop them killing red grouse. We may disagree about some of the laws on the statute book, but we can’t just choose to ignore them. That’s why I sometimes struggle with the phrase “wildlife crime”; this is, quite simply, a crime. These mindless vandals try to justify their actions, even though the issue really is very straightforward: the clue is in the word “illegal”. Yet society continues to turn a blind eye to the routine killing of this magnificent bird of prey. Because hen harrier numbers are so low, seeing them is always a treat – every encounter is enhanced by their rarity. But I for one would not mind if they became so common that we hardly gave them a second glance."
"Last week, a pine tree near a flooded Czech village was voted European tree of the year. Known to the locals of Chudobín as the Guardian of the Flooded Village, the tree is estimated to be 350 years old – the villagers attribute its supernatural powers to tales of a devil who played the violin beneath it during the night. Once part of a larger forest, it was left isolated after the area was flooded during the construction of a dam. England’s finalist in the tree of the year vote was the Allerton Oak in Calderstones Park, Liverpool. It is thought to be about 1,000 years old, and has a girth of 5.5 metres, producing 100,000 acorns per year. In medieval times, court cases were held beneath its canopy and more recently, it is thought Paul McCartney and John Lennon would cycle past the tree on their way to college. This elm, nicknamed after the sentient trees in JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy, was crowned Scotland’s tree of the year. The Last Ent of Affric is a lonely specimen, but isolation protected it from Dutch elm disease – social distancing for trees, if you will. It grows near Glen Affric in the Highlands. Its remote location meant it was long forgotten until it was rediscovered in 2012. The 2019 French tree of the year was the Bird Tree of Ghisonaccia, in the Haute-Corse area of Corsica. A cork oak about 200-230 years old, it is so named because of its unusual silhouette – similar to a bird of prey with extended wings. The curious shape is thought to have been caused by a fire. In 2019, Russia nominated this oak, which stands in the grounds of the Abramtsevo museum, a former artists’ colony north-east of Moscow. The 249-year-old specimen with an impressively far-reaching crown is claimed to have inspired many Russian writers and artists – from the novelist Ivan Turgenev to landscape painters Isaac Levitan and Viktor Vasnetsov."
"Dolphin numbers in the Indian Ocean may have dropped by more than 80% in recent decades, with an estimated 4m small cetaceans caught as “by-catch” in commercial tuna fishing nets since 1950, according to a study. As many as 100,000 cetaceans – mainly dolphins – were caught in commercial gill nets as by-catch in 2006, with current annual numbers at about 80,000. Published in the journal Endangered Species Research, the study used the changes in the numbers of dolphins caught in commercial gill nets as a way to calculate changes in the numbers of dolphins in the Indian Ocean. The authors say gill-net fishing in the Indian Ocean is “effectively unmanaged” and potentially the biggest unresolved issue facing cetaceans today. The study, led by Dr Charles Anderson of the Manta Marine organisation in the Maldives, estimated dolphin numbers had likely dropped to only 13% of their levels before 1980, when large-scale fishing efforts for tuna in the Indian Ocean began. Dr Puti Liza Mustika, a co-author of the study from James Cook University’s College of Business, Law and Governance, told Guardian Australia that most of the dolphins caught accidentally in gill nets did not get reported and were likely discarded over the side of boats. About a third of the tuna pulled from the Indian Ocean is caught in gill nets that hang in the water column – a method that has long concerned conservationists because as well as catching the valuable tuna, they also entangle other species including dolphins, whales, sharks and turtles. In the study, the authors acknowledge the estimates of the impacts on dolphins are “not definitive” and are “subject to much uncertainty”. There was no attempt to differentiate the different dolphin species impacted. But the authors added: “Nevertheless, they do highlight the potential impact of Indian Ocean gill-net fisheries on regional cetacean populations, and the need for much improved monitoring, mitigation and management.” Mustika said some reliable data was available from observers on boats and from previous studies. While the study looked at all cetaceans – dolphins, porpoises and whales – the vast majority being caught were dolphins. “That by-catch number is alarming, but there are a lot of uncertainties because the datasets are insufficient,” Mustika said. Results taken from 10 programs to reliably count by-catch between 1981 and 2016 – carried out in Australia, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan – were used as the basis to extrapolate how many cetaceans were caught across all Indian Ocean fisheries covering 24 countries. Iran, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan were five countries catching the most tuna using gill nets. Together with Oman, Yemen, UAE and Tanzania, those nine countries accounted for almost all the dolphin by-catch. Iran and Indonesia did not report by-catch, Mustika said, while the limited figures that were available from other countries were likely unreliable. About 4.1 million small cetaceans had been caught between 1950 and 2018 in Indian Ocean gill nets. The study said Iran’s average annual catch of 214,262 tonnes of tuna – the greatest haul across the Indian Ocean gill-net fisheries – was likely catching 30,302 cetaceans a year.  The study found that for every 1,000 tonnes of tuna currently being caught, about 175 cetaceans were also being caught. Mustika said the vast majority of those animals would die. “It’s a painful death. Dolphins are clever, but because the net is very thin in the water, the dolphins’ sonar misses them.” She said the fishers should not be seen as “dolphin killers” and those she had spoken with were unhappy when dolphins became caught in their nets. The study said the by-catch estimates could also be too low. “These estimates do not include cetaceans that were caught by gill net but discarded at sea, used as bait and not landed, escaped from capture but subsequently died, or suffered significant sub-lethal impacts, caught in ghost nets or landed but not recorded.” Mustika said solutions to the problem could include working with fishers to switch from the gill nets to other fishing gear, such as pole and line. There had also been trials using devices attached to the nets that deterred dolphins, including lights or devices that caused a rattling sound. Setting nets at shallower depths reduced the by-ctach but also reduced the amount of tuna being caught. “The solution has to be technology, as well as using fishing gears that are more sustainable,” Mustika said. “But banning these fishers is not a solution for developing countries.” She said it was important to understand there was a “political reality” in the Indian Ocean, where hundreds of thousands of relatively poor fishermen and their families relied on the gill nets. The study authors also suggested that increased monitoring, better checks at ports and remote technologies could help bring by-catch numbers down."
"Shenzhen is set to become the first city in mainland China to ban the eating of dogs and cats, if a draft regulation released by the municipal government in a wider push to restrict the consumption of wild animals is approved. On Monday, China’s National People’s Congress issued an order to ban all consumption of wild animal meat and further restrict the wildlife trade nationwide. The measures are expected to be enshrined in the country’s wildlife protection law later this year. The ban is a swift response to the Covid-19 outbreak, thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan, Hubei province in early December. However, the Shenzhen government’s potential ban on dog and cat meat is framed not as part of an effort to reduce disease transmission, but as an aspect of the special relationship between people and pets, which it has called the “consensus of all human civilisation”.  “Shenzhen might just be able to do it, as it is a progressive city in many ways,” said Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and expert on animal protection in China. “I really hope so.” Consumption of dog and cat meat is most common in Shenzhen’s home province of Guangdong, neighbouring Guangxi, and parts of north-east China, though it is not universally practised across the country and has become less acceptable over time. Taiwan outlawed the consumption of dog and cat meat in 2017.“Dog eating has become increasingly controversial in China, with frequent violent clashes between dog thieves and angry dog owners,” said Wendy Higgins, director of international media at Humane Society International (HSI). “There is a growing and vocal Chinese opposition to the dog and cat meat trade, and young people in China are far more likely to think of dogs as companions than cuisine,” she said. The draft regulation is now in a public comment phase running until 5 March and no timeline has been given for the final determination. If the ban goes through, other animals identified as potentially carrying disease – such as turtles, snakes, some birds and insects – could be included on a list of prohibited animals for consumption in line with national rules that are expected in the coming months. Under the Shenzhen ban, fines for serving banned animals at restaurants would range from 20,000 to 200,000 yuan (£2,200–£22,000). HSI has estimated that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while protection group Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at roughly 4 million a year. “The vast majority of dogs caught up in the trade in China are stolen pets and strays snatched from the streets,” Higgins said. “After being stolen or snatched, the animals are crammed in small cages in their hundreds, unable to move, and piled on the back of trucks, packed so tightly they can break limbs.” Animal protection groups have long been concerned with practices used in the dog meat trade, from rearing and theft to transport and slaughter."
"Almost 90 cities and states across the US have suspended water shutoffs for residents unable to afford their bills, as local leaders scramble to tackle the complex public health threats posed by the coronavirus pandemic. There is no vaccine or treatment for coronavirus, also known as Covid-19. According to the World Health Organization, good hygiene, specifically frequent handwashing with soap, is crucial to prevent the virus spreading. The expanding list of public utilities ordering a moratorium on shutoffs means about 57 million Americans in cities including Cleveland, Memphis and San Diego will be protected from losing their water service during the pandemic. Seven states – Wisconsin, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Louisiana – have mandated a halt to shutoffs, according to data provided exclusively to the Guardian by Food & Water Watch (FWW), a not-for-profit organisation tracking the situation. A handful of private water companies, which supply about 15% of Americans, have suspended shutoffs. But just one in five water departments have explicitly agreed to reconnect households currently without running water. The rest have only committed to halting new shutoffs. As a result, potentially hundreds of thousands of impoverished Americans will remain without running water during one of the worst public health crises in modern history. “Suspending water shutoffs is the right thing to do, but reconnecting every household in the country is essential during this emergency in which handwashing is a primary measure to stop the spread,” said Michigan congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, who last year co-sponsored legislation to tackle America’s water crisis. “Clean, safe, affordable water is a basic human need … it is unacceptable and inhumane to shut off people’s water because they can’t afford the bill,” Lawrence said. According to data collected by the New York Times, at least 2,800 people in 49 states, Puerto Rico and Washington DC had tested positive for Covid-19 by Sunday morning, with 59 confirmed deaths. The actual number of cases is almost certainly far higher given the country’s struggle to provide proper screening – one of multiple potentially catastrophic failures being blamed on the Trump administration’s haphazard handling of the pandemic. There is no national database tracking the number of US households without running water. But in 2016, one in every 20 households were disconnected by public water departments, leaving an estimated 15 million Americans without running water, according to research by FWW. The highest shutoffs rates were concentrated in southern or rural states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida and Oklahoma. The hardest-hit cities, such as New Orleans, Detroit and Jacksonville, have high poverty and unemployment rates and more people of color. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, only 10 US cities, among them New York, Flint and Baltimore, had banned water shutoffs. Mary Grant from FWW said: “We need an immediate outright nationwide ban on shutoffs, and must make sure that every household has running water in order to protect human health and our communities.” It is unclear what proportion of the country’s half a million homeless people currently have access to running water. Last week, Detroit became the first city to announce a moratorium. It included the state covering the $25 reconnection fee for homes without water, and a reduced monthly bill for these households during the coronavirus outbreak. According to figures from the Detroit water and sewerage department (DWSD), 3,600 occupied homes (or houses with water usage in the previous 12 months) have been disconnected since April 2019. Of these, a staggering 2,800 were still without running water when the coronavirus reconnection plan was announced. In its first couple of days of implementation, only 73 families were reconnected – partly because DWSD crews had to spend time installing meters in some homes, according to a city spokesman. Residents are being advised to flush the water pipes before drinking in order to reduce the risk of lead poisoning. “The issue is broad, complex and bureaucratic but these numbers are unacceptable,” said Lawrence. Reconnections should speed up this week as three extra plumbers have been hired and the call centre, where residents must register for help, is beefing up capacity. At least 141,000 Detroit households have been disconnected since 2014 as part of a widely condemned debt-collection programme, according to records obtained by Bridge, a news magazine. One study found a significant increase in skin and waterborne gastrointestinal diseases among hospital patients in Detroit who lived on a block where at least one neighbour had been disconnected. The city claims most shutoffs are done in unoccupied houses to prevent flooding and other damage. “What’s happening now … this has been our greatest fear,” said Monica Lewis-Patrick, director of We the People of Detroit, a grassroots coalition and research collective. “It’s undeniable that access to clean water is for the public good. This is a critical moment for the whole nation.”"
"Griff Rhys Jones, the president of the Victorian Society, has urged councils to protect derelict buildings that are of huge importance to Britain’s industrial heritage. His intervention followed a surge in vandalism at such sites, triggered in part by the new-found popularity of exploring abandoned buildings. Last month it emerged that Shotton steelworks in north Wales – one of the society’s 10 most endangered buildings in 2018 – had been badly damaged. According to reports, vandals had knocked down partition walls, destroyed ornate panelling, and kicked in walls. Several fires had been lit and tiles thrown off the roof. The Grade II-listed Tolly Cobbold brewery in Ipswich, which featured in the society’s 2015 top 10, suffered a major blaze last month. Two men in their 20s and a woman in her 40s were arrested on suspicion of arson and have been released pending further inquiries. And last April, the Fisons factory in Bramford, described as “an irreplaceable part of Suffolk’s heritage” and featured in the society’s 2017 top 10, was burned to the ground by arsonists. The vandalised buildings have often lain empty for years while their owners try to balance their plans for redevelopment against conservation restrictions. The society says councils warn owners to improve security, but action is rarely taken. “Buildings under threat need strong security,” Rhys Jones said. “They need maintenance. They need alarms and lighting. Most of all they need concerted imagination and help to be brought back into the community quickly.” The Victorian Society uses its top 10 endangered buildings campaign to highlight what it deems are the UK’s most “in danger” buildings. The society believes it is up to councils, once warned, to ensure the derelict buildings are properly secured. “Personally, I am frightened by empty buildings,” Rhys Jones said. “They gradually sink. They become a lure to intruders.” The vogue for exploring abandoned buildings – sometimes referred to as Urbex or urban exploration – carries new threats, he believes. Books such as No Voice from the Hall: Early Memories of a Country House, by John Harris, who visited more than 200 empty country houses in the postwar years, popularised the practice more than half a century ago. Now, thanks to the internet, there has been an explosion in what Rhys Jones calls “exploratory break-ins”. There are numerous websites dedicated to the urbex craze. “They can feature stunning photos that make the act of entering a deserted building seem an adventure, but for every visitor who has a respect for the building, there might also be one who destroys what they find or steals what they can sell. Some of them simply torch what is there. The truth is that most culprits are aged 14-16. This is thrill-seeking opportunism, isn’t it?” The actor and comedian acknowledged re-educating teenagers about the dangers their actions posed historic buildings was a long shot. “But,” he added, “proper safeguards are not.” He calls on planners and owners, developers and legislators to start looking at better “temporary-use proposals” for the buildings. “If conversion is needed, it is a long and painful process,” Rhys Jones said. Gaining planning permission to convert for commercial premises can take two years to process, he said. “Even security measures require lengthy planning applications. If a listed building can stay used, surely it will have a better chance of living on.”"
"Mostly, these are the worst of times, but for loo roll purveyors and disruptors it will never be better. Sales are up and supermarket shelves are empty as more and more shoppers stockpile. So we should not be surprised by the rise of reusable toilet roll – squares of washable textiles that are linked together with plastic poppers and sold on sites such as Etsy. If you are, like me, invested in a sustainable lifestyle, the idea is quite thrilling. Reusable represents the gold standard of eco-engineering. Everything that is made and used has an eco footprint, which includes the energy used to create the thing in the first place. Single-use products are the worst, recycled a close second. Historically, squeamishness has put some products out of the reach of reusable design, but this is changing. The product designer Isabel Aagaard of LastObject claims to have sold more than 125,000 units of a reusable cotton bud (since March last year). The same company recently brought out a reusable tissue, which people my age still call a handkerchief. Then there are mooncups instead of tampons and, of course, a long tradition in reusable nappies. But are we ready for washable loo roll? The farcical supply chain of toilet roll is certainly ready for disruption: dead-tree paper (or sawdust) is carted across the world, wrapped in plastic and lined up for sale. Even the most ethical versions such as Who Gives a Crap have to be transported (by ship) and delivered to homes in vans. All paper-making is water-intensive, too. The reusable fabric roll kicks all this into touch. Bidets and flannels have previously been touted as the most eco route, but the lifecycle analysis (the process of adding up all the energy costs) of using and washing them is contentious. One Defra study from 2008 put the dampener on eco nappies, saying they used more energy than disposable ones because parents would typically tumble-dry them. The same may well be true for reusable loo roll – even if many devotees only use them for number ones. They will undoubtedly need to be washed at a high temperature – which takes a great a deal of energy. Questions also need to be asked about whether detergents need to be used and do the textiles shed microplastics when washed? Habit and tradition will ultimately decide whether reusable loo roll catches on. The earliest advert I can find on a perforated roll of paper in the UK is in the Lichfield Mercury from 1885. One Frederic Brown (really) guarantees “satisfaction” through the promise of a neat contrivance to replace the standard packet of paper. He cleverly sold a 100-sheet perforated roll with a handsome holder (cost: 2 shillings). What he understood was that if you want to change a habit, you need to sell a whole system. Today’s disruptors shouldn’t just be selling the squares of textile, but also the hamper that can be closed and easily carried to the washing machine. For mass uptake, they probably need to think bigger than the square."
"Small farmers across the globe are losing out in the aftermath of the African swine fever (ASF) outbreak that killed a quarter of the world’s pig population, argues a new report. Nowhere is this more evident than China, where swine fever has hit the country’s nearly 40 million small-scale pig farmers hardest, says the report by non-profit organisation Grain. China’s long tradition of small-scale pig farming seems to be coming to an end because of a lack of government support to compensate for culled or diseased pigs, to pay for veterinary costs or chemicals for limiting the spread of ASF, and other biosecurity measures in existing facilities, according to Grain. “Unfortunately, small farmers are getting almost no support, from what we can see,” said Devlin Kuyek, lead author of the report. After the first notification of the ASF outbreak in China in August 2018, the illness spread rapidly throughout the industry and led to the slaughter of millions of pigs within months. Just a year later, however, the startling rise in pork prices meant that, despite their losses, many of the biggest industrial pig producers were achieving record profits. Grain has been unable to determine exactly how many of the ASF outbreaks originated in large factory farms or within contract farming production chains that feed the bigger facilities, because of a lack of information or official figures from authorities. In a MARA survey of 1,500 Chinese pig farms in mid-2019, 55% said they had abandoned plans to raise pigs after culling due to future risk of disease, while 22% were waiting to see if the situation cleared up. Only 18% had definite plans to continue pig farming. In the 1990s, small backyard farms supplied around 80% of China’s pork needs. But this has changed rapidly over the past two decades, as the government has steadily industrialised the sector. By 2018, the share of pig farms with more than 500 pigs was around 80%, state-run media reported in November. The government is aiming for at least 65% of pork from industrial farming operations by 2025. As the government’s focus has shifted towards supporting larger-scale production, smaller operations continue to be squeezed into contract farming operations for larger companies. “It is the combination of these two changes that has created the conditions for the rise of new epidemics [like ASF and others] in Asia’s pork sector,” Kuyek told the Guardian. Despite the fact that it is supposed to be safer, the huge scale of the industrial pig farming industry has propelled the crisis to a global scale, argues the Grain report. “In our view, this is what explains the scale of the recent outbreak. It would not have taken on such massive proportions if it had not penetrated into the global, industrial pork system.” China is not the only country where small farmers have been particularly adversely affected. In mountainous northern Vietnam, the virus has had a disastrous impact on indigenous women who use leftover mash from rice-wine processing to feed pigs they raise to pay bills and school fees.  Aaron Kingsbury, an assistant professor of Arts and Sciences at Maine Maritime Academy, who was conducting research in the region at the time of the outbreak in Vietnam, witnessed the devastating effects on these small farmers. “Typically, what you get here is an ethnic minority woman who is raising one or two pigs for family consumption or possibly the wet markets,” Kingsbury said. “Something that provides the family with direct income they otherwise would not have.” “When one [operation] gets swine fever [and culling begins], the industrial producers are much more capable of tapping into government subsidies for losses of pigs than these small [producers], sometimes illiterate women who may not speak Vietnamese and are isolated in small communities,” he said. “When these small producers lose a pig, they really lose quite a bit.” The report argues that global meat producers are “using the pandemic that they helped to propagate as a political weapon to consolidate their dominance”.  But Brett Stuart, co-founder of Global AgriTrends, an agriculture consulting firm based in the US, disagrees. “I’m not sure that ASF can be shown as a tool of the big companies,” he said. “The incredible profits now are fuelling small farmer margins as well as large.” Stuart said: “The problem is that complicated diseases like ASF ultimately benefit those with enough scale to pay on-farm vets and implement feed milling procedures, that help protect herds. So while small farmers face a much more uncertain future, that is not enough evidence in my opinion to indict large farmers.” Andriy Rozstalnyy, an ASF expert and animal health expert at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said the organisation was gathering information to enable a full understanding of ASF transmission. “We cannot speculate on the role of each production sector in ASF spread or endemicity, because the production systems and value chains are very long and complicated in south-east Asia and in particular in China,” Rozstalnyy said. “The fragmented and incomplete data does not fully explain the real epidemiological situation in south-east Asia. FAO is working to collect and analyse data to better understand ASF transmission including the role of feed, fomites, pork products in production systems with different biosecurity practices. This understanding is used to assist countries in development of technically sound and feasible control strategies.” Rozstalnyy said early detection and containment of ASF outbreaks challenges both small and large-scale operators and both sectors need to be vigilant about any risky practices and aware of establishing more bio-secure practices. “It doesn’t matter if it is a small-scale backyard farmer or workers at a large scale commercial farm, feed supplier, butcher, hunter or international traveller. [They all] need to strictly follow rules and regulations defined by governments to address risks related to ASF.”"
"A lonely pine tree believed by superstitious locals to act as sentinel over a flooded Czech village has been chosen as Europe’s tree of the year, beating stiff competition from a Croatian gingko tree, a Portuguese chestnut and an English oak. The Guardian of the Flooded Village has grown for 350 years on a rocky height near the village of Chudobin, said locally to play host to a devil that sat under it at night, playing the violin and warding off intruders – though in reality the eerie sounds are more likely to have come from the strong winds blowing over the valley. Its guardianship was doomed, however, as a dam was constructed on the site and flooded the village, leaving only the lonely pine tree as witness to its former existence. Whether the devil still plays there is unknown. Supernatural powers attributed to trees ranked multiple times in this year’s competition: another guardian tree, from Romania, took fifth place and two witch trees – in the Netherlands and Ireland – also scored highly. The UK’s entry, the Allerton Oak, came in seventh place. Growing in Liverpool’s Calderstones Park, the oak tree was where judges would meet to hold trials in medieval times, instead of a courthouse. A large crack in the tree is said to date from 1864 when a ship carrying gunpowder exploded on the Mersey – the explosion was heard 30 miles away and shattered thousands of windows. Christmas cards containing leaves from the Allerton oak were sent to staff from Liverpool’s parks who were fighting at the front, to remind them of home. It was chosen as England’s tree of the year last autumn. Four oaks made it to the final shortlist, with a “three-legged” specimen from Spain gaining more than 14,000 votes to take eighth place, followed by a venerable oak from Bulgaria and one from Italy. The ceremony for this year’s popular competition, which attracted more than 285,000 votes across Europe, was called off in Brussels because of the widespread coronavirus lockdown, and took place online instead, with a video presentation of the history of the three top trees. The competition, organised by the Environmental Partnership Association and the European Landowners’ Organisation, is intended to highlight the emotional connection many people feel to trees, as well as some of the threats to trees, including the impacts of the climate crisis, pollution and the cutting down of ancient forest across Europe."
"“You can’t work on North Atlantic right whales and be a pessimist,” Clay George tells me. He’s a senior wildlife biologist and right whale specialist at Georgia’s department of natural resources, and one of the only people in the south formally trained to disentangle a whale from fishing gear. Right whales are known to spend most of their time near the surface of the water, feeding and socializing. This behavior leaves them vulnerable to boat strikes and entanglement in fishing lines, almost exclusively the cause of their deaths. There are so few North Atlantic right whales left in the world’s oceans – estimates hover around 400 – that many are known entities to the scientists who devote their careers to saving them. They often identify them by the patterns of callosity on their heads, raised tissue colored white by an infestation of cyamids, commonly known as “whale lice”. I want to know if George feels any optimism at the slight uptick in calving in 2020, as 10 were seen in calving grounds this winter. There were zero calves recorded in 2018, and according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, calving has been down 40% since 2010. “People always focus on the calves,” George says. “But what really matters is protecting the females of reproductive age. There are only 100 left, and at their current calving rates, they aren’t replacing themselves, or the number of right whales killed each year by human activity.” The females need to have an estimated 17-20 calves total each year to sustain the population. I mention Dragon, a 19-year-old female right whale spotted this year off the coast of Nantucket with a fishing buoy entangled in her mouth, dying. George pauses. “I remember when she had her first calf,” he says. “You know, it’s not a quick death,” George adds. “They suffer out there, entangled and not able to feed. It’s long and painful.” George has watched whales struggle to survive horrendous ship strike injuries. He’s seen fishing rope embedded in the whales’ faces, cutting through bones, entire lips pulled off. One of his favorite whales is Ruffian, whom he first spotted with chunks of blubber missing after an entanglement. “We assumed he was a goner,” George says. “But he came back the next season, scarred.” Ruffian returned to Georgia waters another time, snow crab rope trailing behind him. “Eighty per cent of right whales have scars,” George tells me. “And 60% have been entangled twice. People would be shocked.” Right whales were once hunted to near-extinction by whalers. They were known as the “right” and easy whale to hunt – docile, slow-swimming and huge – 52 feet long and sometimes weighing in just under 70 tons. Often referred to as the “urban whale”, North Atlantic right whales spend most of their year feeding close to the shorelines of New England and Atlantic Canada. Each winter pregnant females and other members of the species migrate 1,000 miles south to Georgia and Florida, the species’ only known calving grounds. Their coastal distribution places them in close proximity to large population centers, and all the human activities that go with that, from commercial fishing and shipping, to pollution and military training.  No one really knows how long North Atlantic right whales can live, because human activity has affected their life spans so drastically. Experts presume they can live until 65 or 70, though some species of whale, like the bowhead, can live to 200. What we do know is that human activity has endangered this species and drastically shortened their lifespan to 35-40. This year’s calving season of 10, while better than zero, is still not enough to sustain the species. Plus, one of the 10 calves was probably mortally injured in a boat strike in the first days of its life. Make that a calving season of nine – less than half of what the right whales need to replenish themselves. Why is it so hard to save this intelligent, gentle giant – one so critical to the health of our planet? (Whale excrement fertilizes phytoplankton that produce a significant amount of oxygen on Earth.) “A species that most people have never seen is harder to convince others to save,” says Dr Erica Fuller, a veterinarian and a lawyer with Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, Massachusetts. “If you saw one, you’d be struck by how majestic they are.” The whales are at risk any time fishing rope is left unattended in their habitat. But ropes used on offshore gillnets, lobster pots, snow crab pots and other so-called “fixed gear” fisheries are particularly problematic. These synthetic ropes can be set for weeks or months at a time, and require thousands of pounds of force to break loose from. “Much of the frustration of the right whale work is the slowness at which agencies are taking action,” Fuller says. “Plus, the same federal agency charged with authorizing the commercial fisheries that entangle them is also in charge of protecting this critically endangered species. It’s a terrible conflict of interest.” The real tragedy, according to Fuller, happened when the whales traveled into the Gulf of St Lawrence looking for food and, simultaneously, the snow crab fishery exploded. This shift was the perfect storm for entanglement, responsible for several deaths in 2017. When I speak with Regina Asmutis-Silvia, executive director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, she is quick to point out that no fishermen intend to catch whales. “They aren’t doing it on purpose,” she says. “We know they face hardships, too.” Asmutis-Silvia, who has been working on these issues for 30 years, remembers seeing her first entangled whale: “You could see visible infections, and the whale was in a great deal of pain. The skin had grown over the line. For me, that’s when entanglement moved from a conceptual problem to a real one.” There hasn’t yet been a broad fix to entanglement. “I think we’re closer with so-called ropeless fishing gear,” Asmutis-Silvia says. “It’s a costly transition, but it has tremendous potential. It’s the most promising solution I’ve seen.” And then there’s the boat collisions. More than half of the known right whale population migrated into Cape Cod Bay in the summer of 2019, following their food source of phytoplankton. As they journey there and further northward toward Canada, they cross shipping lanes, putting them at risk of death by blunt force trauma and propeller cuts. Research shows that slowing shipping speeds down from an average of 24 knots to 10 can help improve the odds for right whales, but several ships were fined by Transportation Canada for ignoring the warnings. The reduction in speed orders are lifted when no right whales are spotted, but detection mechanisms are faulty, and ship strikes have contributed to 30 deaths of right whales in the last three years. The right whale calf born to Derecha that was struck this calving season – its head sliced by the propeller of a vessel – is presumed dead. “Trying to understand where the right whales are, and what their lives are like underwater, is difficult for humans,” Dr Genevieve Davis says. She’s an expert in passive acoustic monitoring, listening for whales as they pass through specific zones. Right whales are vocal – when socializing in “surface active groups” they scream, blow, gunshot, upcall, warble and downcall. “People don’t think about noise pollution as a common threat, but it masks important communication cues,” Davis says. “A calf might not be able to find her mother. These whales need to navigate, find mates and locate food. There’s a masking effect that changes communication abilities. “If you think about Massachusetts bays and New York harbors,” she says, “it’s like trying to talk on a phone in the city with sirens and traffic, versus talking on a phone in an empty field. That’s what their world is like now.” This human-caused “acoustic smog” travels far, and is now constant in our ocean. It includes vessels, alternative energy sources and seismic surveys, which Davis says are so loud they can cause chronic stress and physical pain, like being next to the speakers at a loud concert. Passive acoustic tracking is an important component of a suite of whale-tracking measures, including aerial surveys and reports from fishermen. Currently there is no reliable, compassionate way to track the right whales with GPS, which would theoretically help boat captains avoid ship strikes. Blubber and water make tagging difficult. “No tagging method is really long-term,” Dr Davis says. “These whales are already endangered and many are in poor health – we don’t want to cause more suffering.” “I look forward to the day when there aren’t more people working to save right whales than the actual number of whales themselves,” Asmutis-Silvia tells me. She recounts the time she spotted a right whale named Wart off the coast of Cape Cod, with a calf. “There she was,” Asmutis-Silver says. “A tiny little shoehorn face with no callosity. The crazy thing is that Wart had been entangled several years prior. We thought she was dead – but here she comes back, free of gear, and gives birth in Cape Cod. It was incredible.” “They’re so amazing – so resilient,” she adds. “These whales have such an ability to recover if we would only give them the chance.” Climate change is already acting as a cruel catalyst, warming the whales’ habitat, causing currents to shift and altering the distribution of plankton the whales depend on. If these changes force the whales into new habitats with greater human activities but fewer protections, the results could be disastrous. This is exactly what appears to be happening in the Gulf of St Lawrence in Canada, where more than 20 right whales (5% of the existing population) have been found dead since 2017. “Everything we think we know this summer could be different two summers from now,” Dr Fuller says. “Watching right whales has been compared to watching the decline of vaquitas,” Dr Fuller tells me. “We’re watching the last ones die.” “We’re responsible for the right whales’ demise,” she says, “and we are responsible for saving them from extinction.” If you see a violation or injured animal, call the Northeast Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Stranding and Entanglement Hotline: (866) 755-6622. If you’re a boater, download the Whale Alert app so you know when and where right whales are present – and slow down."
"A raven greets me at the gateway, a tutelary spirit flying low overhead. I’m on the southern path, steep and stony, edged with castles of leggy gorse. As I climb, the sun rises rose-gold, netted in the twigs of an oak silhouetted on the ridge above. This part of the hill is a mosaic of heath, grass, bracken and bramble, punctuated with mature pedunculate oaks and grazed by cattle. Last year the area was cut back in places to encourage bell heather. Now the cleared areas are studded with green rosettes of seedling foxgloves, ready to rocket upwards. By July they will have formed thickets of magenta tridents. A greater spotted woodpecker drums insistently in the thread of woodland below, matched by the leaping laugh of a green woodpecker yaffling through the scrub. Nearby, a female yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) hops about the undergrowth while two males contend for a singing perch, their zinging canary-lemon heads matching the gorse flowers in brilliance. Yellowhammers are surprisingly well camouflaged, despite their vivid plumage. They have a distinctive song, a fast, scissoring “che-che-che-che-che-and-wheeze” that the children’s author Enid Blyton characterised as “a little bit of bread and no cheese”. About half the time, these two males either don’t mention cheese, or else they sing the final, long note so quietly and lightly that it becomes a faint, plaintive cry. This is because they are singing in Dorset dialect. Citizen science projects in Europe and New Zealand discovered that yellowhammers have slightly different ways of ending the song depending on their region. Females prefer males who share their dialect. It’s a treat to hear them. Yellowhammers are one of several species to have vanished from most of the Marshwood Vale, largely due to farming practices. They need thick, sheltering hedges with untidy bases that provide plenty of cover. While the vale has miles of ancient hedgerows, most are flailed twice a year, reducing them to neat but inhospitable sticks. Lambert’s Castle is a designated site of special scientific interest, and managed accordingly. In the iron age it was a fort where people perhaps retreated in times of crisis. Now it’s providing a refuge for non-human species."
"A push by power baron Trevor St Baker to access a Morrison government climate policy initiative to pay for an upgrade at a 42-year-old coal power plant has been rejected after a review found it should not qualify. As reported by Guardian Australia, the Vales Point coal plant in New South Wales was registered with the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, the “direct action” policy introduced by Tony Abbott and extended by Scott Morrison, in August 2018. Its owners, Sunset Power International trading as Delta Electricity, wanted to bid for taxpayers’ support to help pay for a $14m project to replace turbine blades. The proposal stalled when the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the fund, said the company had not provided enough information. It ruled the upgrade would have needed to cut the plant’s emissions intensity – how much it emits per unit of electricity generated – below the grid average. A consultant working on behalf of Delta lobbied the government for the rules to be changed, arguing the guidelines for the fund said coal power could be eligible. Documents released last April suggest St Baker, the company’s part-owner, was denied an “urgent meeting” on the issue, but the then environment minister, Melissa Price, requested a review of how the policy could be used. A scheduled review by the independent emissions reduction assurance committee was already under way at the time. The resulting report, posted online earlier this month, backs the existing rules enforced by the regulator. The decision was welcomed by activists and analysts who argue coal plants, which emit substantial greenhouse gases, should not receive climate funding. But they noted Vales Point was still also in line to receive an $11m federal grant, according to a document released in February, before coronavirus delayed the government’s budget plans. Richie Merzian, from the Australia Institute, said the committee’s decision showed the value of “truly independent entities” that served the public on climate change. “Lobbying by coal executives has put much pressure on the government to allow greater access to climate funding for the coal industry,” Merzian said. “Fortunately, the independent review committee has made the right choice in maintaining the legal checks and balances that ensure the [fund] is not rorted.” Suzanne Harter, a campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said it was unbelievable that an environment minister had asked officials to consider ways climate funding could be given to old coal plants. “Fortunately, common sense prevailed in this instance,” she said. “Public money should not be given to millionaires to prop up their ailing toxic investments.” Delta Electricity’s chief executive, Greg Everett, declined to comment on Monday as the company was focused on its response to coronavirus. Freedom-of-information documents last year showed the company’s consultant, John Short, had suggested to the government it would consider appealing to the administrative appeals tribunal if the regulator’s decision was not overturned. Delta wanted to bid into the emissions reduction fund to help replace components on two units commissioned in 1978. It was estimated the upgrade would have cut emissions by 900,000 tonnes over a decade, about a 1.3% reduction below what Vales Point would otherwise expect to emit. The company bought the plant from the NSW government for just $1m in 2015. It was re-valued at $730m two years later. Documents submitted to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission show Sunset Power International’s shareholders received dividends of nearly $72m over the past two financial years. St Baker has flagged extending Vales Point’s operation beyond its expected closure date of 2029 to 2049. The company said a decision on prolonging the plant’s life was not contingent on public funding. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction, rewarding landowners and businesses that make cheap, viable bids for taxpayers’ support to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The next auction is scheduled for this week. Asked for a response to the committee assessment, a spokesman for the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said: “The government’s objective is to bring forward large volumes of genuine, low cost abatement from across the economy.”"
"In the hedgerows the blackthorn is shooting sprays of small white blossom upwards, thus signalling the end of the winter. If this is so, then we have had an exceptionally warm and wet season. Perhaps counter-intuitively, such weather can spell disaster for many insects; adapted as they are to sitting out a season, their biggest enemies become mould and bacteria that may proliferate in their dormant tissues. Concern turns to the potential impact on already struggling populations of insects that have faced so many challenges in recent times, most blatantly the fragmentation and pollution of their habitats. We must firmly add climate change to this list, the most recent evidence coming from a long-term study of glow-worm populations in Essex that found an overall fall of 75% in their numbers on 19 sites. Glow-worms are enigmatic and intriguing animals at every level. I can recall camping near Hastings as a child and seeing one glowing in the vegetation, but on investigating the mysterious light blinked out and the source could not be discovered. The larvae and the wingless female, Lampyris noctiluca, are brown segmented animals, not as instantly recognisable as beetles; they feast on snails and possess a white spongy appendage that extrudes from their rear-end and wipes snail slime from their body. The eyes of the adult male beetle are also fantastic: two great hooded orbs, aerial searchers for the cool, green lights of the females. “Bright scatter’d, twinkling star of spangled earth,” the Northamptonshire poet John Clare wrote of them in 1820, “Thy pale-fac’d glimmering light I love to see.” But everyone who is anyone has written about glow-worms; they are in A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Blake’s A Dream, as well as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Pliny, Dr Johnson and William Cowper. “We are all worms,” Churchill stated, “but I do believe that I am a glow-worm.” Like coral reefs, glow-worms must now go on to the “last chance to see” list. There are still places in Northamptonshire and farther afield where they can be found, and perhaps this June we should go and see them, while we can."
"Tim Lang likes to take the long view. A conversation with the internationally renowned professor of food policy at London’s City University will roam in detail from the repeal of the Corn Laws, through Brexit and back again, the narrative seasoned with detailed facts and figures. It’s why he has been a consultant to the World Health Organization, special adviser to four House of Commons select committee inquiries and a food policy adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. So when he says in his new book, Feeding Britain, that, “although not officially at war, the UK is, de facto, facing a wartime scale of food challenge”, it’s worth paying attention. We are, he says, in serious trouble. Lang, who established the pioneering Centre for Food Policy at City University in 1994, makes no apologies for the bluntness of the statement. “I did not write that lightly,” he says, when we meet in central London. “I sat in my study, reviewing all the data. Things have just got worse.” Even so, he recognises how it looks. Panic buying aside, our supermarket shelves are usually full. We have access to a greater range of ingredients at better prices than at any time in human history. The conversation around how and what we eat often feels like it sits front and centre of the culture. “I like my food,” he says. “More joy around food has come into our lives.” And yet, he says, all of that masks a bitter reality: we have a massively fragile just-in-time supply chain which could easily collapse; a depleted agriculture sector which produces only around 50% of the food we actually eat, leaving us at the mercies of the international markets; and production methods which are damaging to the environment and human health. “When I looked at the numbers on inequality,” he says, “I was shocked. There’s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food.” As he says: “Food is the biggest driver of NHS spending as a result of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.” Food may look cheap, he adds, but too much of it creates vast, unsustainable costs elsewhere. His doorstep of a book attempts both diagnosis and cure. Consciously, it pushes the impact of Brexit to one side to get at the underlying dysfunction. Likewise, we agree to discuss the implications of coronavirus later. Nevertheless, he says, it all amounts to the same thing. “There is a mismatch between human need, the food system and its outcomes.” At the heart of this crisis is a British willingness to let a small number of corporations dominate food retailing: just eight companies control 90% of our food supply. “It’s the ‘leave it to Tesco’ approach,” he says. The prioritisation of price has hollowed out UK agriculture, so that primary producers get the smallest slice of the cake. “They get about 5% or 6% of the value of the food we buy. They need double that. And that 50% self-sufficiency should be nearer 80%. Not out of nationalism, but so we are in a position to contribute globally. We have a default position of assuming someone else will feed us.” The book comes freighted with eye-popping data. For example, of the six million hectares of cultivatable land in Britain, only 168,000 hectares are used for fruit and vegetables. As a result, we have to import vast amounts of crops we could otherwise be growing. Much of the remaining land is used for crops to feed livestock or for processed foods. “The government is now so reliant on the retailers, they are setting them up to fail,” he says. “At the height of the arguments over a no-deal Brexit, the heads of the big food companies were briefing the government about just how fragile the food supply chain is. Brexit has shone a spotlight on that fragility.” I ask where he thinks this dysfunctional system has come from. “There is a culture of British exceptionalism. We were the first industrial nation in the 18th century and then became the dominant imperial power in the 19th century and pursued that as a way of feeding ourselves.” Critics often point out that we were less self-sufficient in food in the early 20th century than we are now. True, Lang says, but that was specifically because we had an empire which we ravaged to keep our tables and bellies full. He’s at pains to acknowledge that he is not the first person to raise these issues. He first became interested in the subject in the 1970s when, having just completed his social psychology PhD, he started farming in Wales. He came across a book called Our Food Problem and Its Relation to Our National Defences, published in 1939. One of its authors was Frederick Le Gros Clark, a sometime children’s writer who went on to become an expert in malnutrition. Like Lang, he argued that the British food supply chain was exceedingly delicate and was not serving the health of the nation. The outbreak of war would prove him right. There was also a review of the British food system in 1936 by William Beveridge, later architect of the welfare state, who made similar arguments. “Beveridge was totally ignored,” Lang says. In the summer of 2019, then Defra secretary Michael Gove announced he was establishing a national food strategy, which was broadly welcomed by the food industry. He put his friend Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon healthy fast-food chain, in charge of the review, even though he has no academic credentials in the field. Lang is polite about the classic British choice of a non-expert generalist to lead the review, but he does say that he’s concerned that, like Beveridge, Dimbleby’s review will be ignored when it’s eventually published. “When the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food,” he says. What’s Lang’s solution? It’s detailed and includes the introduction of a food resilience and sustainability act, complete with legally binding targets. National nutritional guidelines should become the basis for food procurement contracts, both public and private. There should be an audit of food production in the UK and the budget for public health should be doubled from £2.5bn of the £130bn health budget to £5bn. It also proposes the creation of no fewer than nine bodies or institutions, including a royal commission to map a new set of “multi-criteria principles for the UK food system”, a food resilience and sustainability council and a network of urban and rural food and farming colleges. I suggest this is an old-fashioned 1970s corporatist approach; that he’s proposing a massive expansion of the state to deal with the problem. “I think I’ve been pretty modest,” Lang says. “The British state is failing us by not decentralising.” He also calls for Tesco, which has around 30% of the food retail market, to be broken up, so that no one firm has more than 15%. Likewise, he calls for pension funds to disinvest from manufacturers of ultra-processed foods, as some have started doing with fossil fuels. The list goes on. He insists, however, that this is not some kneejerk leftist manifesto. “We just need to re-engineer how capitalism works for us.” We agree we can no longer ignore the viral elephant both inside the room and outside it. Might the coronavirus crisis help with the re-engineering of our food supply chain? He agrees, sadly, that it might. “It could prove a good reminder of the value of state institutions,” he says. And the emptying of shelves as a result of panic buying may help people to “think about where their food comes from”. He adds: “We need to move from a ‘me’ food culture to a ‘we’ food culture.” It’s a very simple message, but in the white heat of a crisis, defined by queues outside supermarkets, a useful one.  The headline of this article was amended on 23 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the content and context of the interview with Lang.

"Look down into the waters of the Venice canals today and there is a surprising sight – not just a clear view of the sandy bed, but shoals of tiny fish, scuttling crabs and multicoloured plant-life. “The water is blue and clear,” said Gloria Beggiato, who owns the celebrated Metropole Hotel a few steps from St Mark’s square and has a view over the Venice lagoon. “It is calm like a pond, because there are no more waves caused by motorised boats transporting day-tripper tourists. And of course, the giant cruise ships have disappeared.” Under Venice’s strict rules of self-confinement to prevent the spread of the coronavirus – all journeys but a trip to walk the dog or buy food are forbidden – the ancient city has been transformed almost overnight. La Serenissima’s hundreds of canals have been emptied of speeding motorboat taxis, transport and tourist boats. The chugging vaporetti water buses now run on a reduced timetable. Even most of the gondolas are moored. The clarity of the water has improved dramatically. Cormorants have returned to dive for fish they can now see. At the Piazzale Roma vaporetto stop, ducks have even made a nest. “Someone has put up a sign saying, ‘Don’t tread on the duck eggs,’’” Beggiato said. “All totally unimaginable a while ago.” As the death toll from coronavirus in Italy outstrips that of China, the government of Giuseppe Conte has tried to keep citizens at home using a mix of social media and police controls. But locals are still moving about cautiously to do their daily shopping – except now in a city without visitors. It is a remarkable transformation for a city that until recently saw protests against overtourism under the No Grande Navi (“No more cruise ships”) slogan. At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance. In a queue to buy fish at his local fishmonger in Canareggio, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: “When I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.” “For the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?” said Franco Folin, a fisherman. “But when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited – there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.” The apparent cleanliness of the water is not in fact due to a lack of pollution, said Davide Tagliapetra, an environmental researcher at the Institute of Marine Science. He told a local TV station that the reason is the absence of motorised transport, which normally churns up the muddy canal floor. Matteo Bisol runs the vineyard restaurant Venissa on the tiny lagoon island of Mazzorbo, and has been campaigning for a more eco-responsible, sustainable model of tourism in Venice for some time. “For goodness sake, it is not surprising there are fish in the canals of Venice,” he said. “If there were not, then we should all be worried as the lagoon here is a fragile ecosystem. People need to realise that if we control and cut down boat traffic in Venice and its lagoon then we could all discover a unique biosphere.” It is not just the cruise ships that are gone: the souvenir stalls that line the Riva degli Schiavoni, the Murano glass and lace shops, and the bars and restaurants are all closed. It is a brutal hit to an economy that relies on tourism, but in the meantime locals appear to be rediscovering their city, in an admittedly constrained way. “We Venetians have the feeling that nature has returned and is taking back possession of the city,” said Beggiato. “If you ask me today – sunny blue skies, clear canals – then, yes, we would all like Venice to stay like this for a while. But we need, and look forward to, the return of tourists, though maybe not the 20 million a year that we have had to cope with. “I honestly believe we should take the opportunity of this lockdown to reflect and see how we can be more organised in the future to find a balance between the city and tourism.”"
"The New South Wales Forestry Corporation has continued to log unburnt forest that is habitat for some of the most imperilled species in the aftermath of the state’s bushfire crisis. Logging operations have continued in the Styx River state forest on the north coast that is now remnant habitat for endangered species including the greater glider and the Hastings River mouse. Both the federal and state governments have identified the mouse, which had 82% of its habitat burnt, as one of the species most at risk of extinction as a result of the bushfire disaster. Trucks have also moved into an area of the Lower Bucca state forest north-west of Coffs Harbour in bushland that is part of the proposed Great Koala national park. Twenty-four per cent of koala habitat in eastern NSW was burnt in the fire crisis and the environment minister, Sussan Ley, has said up to 30% of the koala population on the mid north coast may have been killed. Environment groups and the independent state MLC Justin Field have expressed dismay that NSW Forestry Corporation has been able to continue with harvest plans in unburnt forest that is now important remnant habitat for wildlife. The Nature Conservation Council of NSW asked the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) to investigate the logging. But the council’s chief executive said it was told that operations could not be halted when Forestry Corporation was not in breach of its approvals. The council is now calling on the state government to suspend the coastal integrated forestry operations approval (IFOA) until assessments of the impact of the fires are complete. “They’ve [Forestry Corporation] finished their operation in Styx River so my guess is whatever damage was going to be done has been done,” Gambian said. “But it’s not too late to halt operations everywhere else in the state.” Gambian said the government should offer an assistance package to the industry to support timber communities. “We understand there are communities that rely on the timber industry for their survival,” he said. “This shouldn’t be a fight between the timber industry and koalas.” Since the fire crisis, the forestry industry has pushed for more access to burnt areas of forest for logging. But state politicians have been surprised to learn that logging of unburnt areas has continued as per harvesting plans. In an estimates hearing last Friday, the Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann said Forestry Corporation had told an inquiry into the state’s koala populations “it was no longer logging unburnt forest while this assessment of the impact on threatened species was continuing”. “Yet, in fact, in the Styx River state forest, they were continuing to log and the EPA realised that,” Faehrmann said. She asked EPA officials whether the burning of more than 80% of the Hastings River mouse’s habitat had prompted them to suggest logging operations in remaining habitat should stop. “Did that not trigger anything within the EPA to suggest to State Forests that it should stop logging those compartments where probably the last few little Hastings River mice, post-fire, were potentially living?” she asked. Officials said they would respond on notice with the scientific advice they received. But they said EPA ecologists had raised concerns about the impact of logging on species affected by fire. “There were issues raised and concern raised about post-fire logging activity and the impact on species,” David Fowler of the EPA told the hearing. The steering committee for the Great Koala national park met with the environment minister, Matt Kean, this week and asked him to investigate logging operations in the Lower Bucca state forest. “We requested an immediate end to logging in unburnt forest on the north coast, particularly unburnt forest that is known koala habitat,” Ashley Love a member of the steering committee and the Bellingen Environment Centre said. Love said the operations were in a significant patch of forest he described as “the largest unburnt remnant within the proposed Great Koala national park”. The Bees Nest fire on the NSW north coast burnt large amounts of koala habitat to the west of the Lower Bucca. Love said it meant the Lower Bucca was now potentially an important site for surviving populations that might later repopulate burnt areas when the bushland recovered. Guardian Australia sought comment from the forestry minister, John Barilaro, and from Kean. Response was provided via the NSW Forestry Corporation, which said 70% of its harvesting operations on the north coast had been moved into plantations. A spokeswoman said there were “a small number of areas of unburnt forest still being harvested, maintaining sustainable timber supplies in demand for rebuilding and work in communities where employment in forestry and the timber industry is important”. “There are strict regulations around forestry operations that were developed by expert scientific panels to ensure a high level of protection for wildlife during harvesting operations,” she said. The spokeswoman said Forestry Corporation was also working with NSW government agencies, led by the EPA, to “develop appropriate conditions for harvesting timber from a small proportion of forests that are set aside for timber production and affected by fire”. But the independent MP Justin Field said it was “unacceptable to the community that some of our last unburnt forests are being logged before the assessment of the impact of these fires has even been completed”. “Forestry Corporation need to be called to account by the forestry minister and the environment minister. If the laws are allowing this to happen then the laws need to change.”"
"A large rat scampers across a shady forest floor in search of its latest meal of Kiwi chicks, one of New Zealand’s endangered native birds. But the rodent is in the sights of another predator – a mammoth drone carrying hundreds of kilograms of deadly poison. This scene could soon be playing out across New Zealand’s most rugged wilderness as the Department of Conservation (DoC) considers a new high-tech strategy to halt the country’s biodiversity crisis. A drone, which is seven metres long and looks like a mini-helicopter, is being developed to wipe out pests in areas that humans simply can’t access due to steep cliffs, deep ravines and impenetrable vegetation. Conservation rangers usually hike into remote spots to lay bait stations and traps to kill stoats, rats and possums; invasive species the government has vowed to eradicate from the whole country by 2050. For hard to reach parts of the wilderness, manned helicopters have been extensively used by DoC, but the department is now investigating cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives in an increasingly climate-aware age. By the hour, drones are two-thirds cheaper than helicopters, and emit 85% less carbon, drone manufacturers say – a priority for a left-leaning government that has committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. Drones are more precise than helicopters, and are able to drop their bait loads within centimetres of the target, an important consideration when accidental poisonings of endangered native species are still occurring. “Restoring nature so indigenous species can thrive requires new tools and technologies,” minister of conservation Eugenie Sage said. “Drones have the potential to be a game-changer.” Brent Beaven, head of the Predator Free 2050 programme at DoC, said more than 1 million hectares of land was being targeted for pest eradication “so there’s plenty of New Zealand” for the drones to deal with. “We are in a changing world, we can use helicopters for a lot of stuff, but our carbon footprint needs to track towards zero, we need to be looking at other options,” Beaven said. “My dream is that one day we’ll have artificial intelligence devices that will detect the presence of a pest somewhere that will automatically link to a messaging service that will send a drone out – wouldn’t that be great?” Beaven said after three years of exterminating pests on 117 offshore islands the next phase of the project was “science”. A sum of NZ$790,000 (£390,000) has been awarded to Kiwi startup Environment & Conservation Technologies (ECT) to engineer drone technology designed to withstand the unique challenges of the New Zealand bush, which include harsh sub-alpine environments and violent, unpredictable weather. ECT has undertaken similar pest eradication programmes using drones in the Pacific and the Galapagos islands. In the Galapagos, an infestation of black and brown rats was threatening the survival of the vulnerable, ground-dwelling bird population, and two drones were deployed by ECT to drop 1.5 tonnes of bait over 184 hectares in two days. The South American regional director of Island Conservation, Karl Campbell, who worked alongside ECT said drones saved the conservation group hundreds of thousands of dollars, and were far quicker and less invasive than traditional pest eradication measures. Helicopters were previously used. “The use of drones is more precise; it also increases feasibility, and reduces eradication costs of invasive rodents in small and mid-size islands worldwide,” Campbell said. The successful eradication of the rat invasion on the Galapagos is thought to be a world first. Using knowledge gained in the Galapagos project, Sam Vye of ECT said the potential for drones in the conservation arena was “exciting”; though he ruled out weaponising the machines for armed pest extermination from the sky. “New Zealand’s environment has extreme terrain and vegetation type and can be extremely dangerous for people on the ground to lay bait stations,” Vye said. “Using a drone we can actually fly in slightly more dangerous conditions than a manned helicopter, including to remote islands which are expensive for helicopters to get to. Compared to a manned helicopter, it also comes down to the precision and the placement of baits.” The drone being developed for use in the New Zealand back country will be able to carry up to 170kg of bait. It requires only a drone pilot on the ground and an office worker to control it. So far the government has totally eradicated introduced pests from 117 offshore islands, and is now focusing its attention on the mainland. The drone trial will run over the next two years and involve three phased stages of testing."
"Within the hour, the fog seeded itself, took root and wound an alchemy through the hedgerow. Wild clematis (Clematis vitalba) has become a familiar companion, roping together every dog walk, ride, run and drive I have done in my home counties of Berkshire, Hampshire and Wiltshire. This most magical of chalk plants has an ability to appear and disappear, seemingly at will – although this is weather related. In wet weather, the sodden, damson-coloured seedheads turn spidery and go unnoticed. In dry weather, however, the feathery plumes fluff and curl in on themselves to form globes that catch the light. Then they form an ethereal smoke blossom in silver, gold or bronze, appearing at the same hour for days before vanishing, then reappearing. The plant has a phantom quality. Halfway between the two weathers, particularly in fog, the seedhead centres of the globes each hold a pearl of light in a drop of water. Diffused by fronds like miniature ostrich plumes, they glow like tiny Victorian gas lamps, or dimming fairy lights. Wild clematis has many names: traveller’s joy, old man’s beard, shepherd’s delight, smokewood. My preferred name is bedwine, from the old Berkshire border dialect. Adam Thorpe revived the name in his novel of this place, Ulverton. Bedwine twines through the centuries and chapters of his book. It’s a curious name, until you say “betwined” in the accent, dropping the “t”, then the “d”. This winter, I used the thick vines hanging from tall trees as a swing. Hanging down like ropes in a school gymnasium and stirring childhood memories, the great, twisted, straw-like cables seemed to suggest I should. I stepped into a creaking loop half a metre off the ground, like a nervous novice trapeze artist, above a shallow chalk pit netted with it. A hank uncoiled. It did not break, but I was tipped upside down, scattering wood pigeons, caught by an ankle and the unyielding, twisted vine that had somehow slipped around my waist. I wriggled free and made a slow, undignified fall into the safety net below, just out of a flailing arm’s reach."
"Clear winter skies make for a frosty but brilliantly sunny morning; the low slanting light is soaked up by the conifer stands, but lances through the high ash forest. Wakerley Great Wood is a substantialmixed plantation and woodland, managed by Forestry England. It is less renowned than the similarly sized, nearby Fineshade or Fermlyn Woods: probably because it does not match their depth of richness in wildlife. It is, however, popular with mud-speckled cyclists, who become increasingly frequent as the morning defrosts. A network of paths span the wood and a dedicated mountain biking trail weaves between conifer trunks, up and down the slopes, including some reasonably exhilarating banked s- and hairpin bends. Exploring the muddy paths to the west leads out of the conifers and into ash woodland with a smattering of hazel. The ground is sporadically deeply pitted with surface mines. Here in medieval times people laboured to dig out ironstone, and the air would have rung with the clang of picks and scrape of shovels, the stone being carted to Wakerley and fed into the iron smelters. Today the tits chirping in the trees are competing in the soundscape with a distant cacophony. A mechanical booming thunder, interspersed with clanking and bangs, drifts in from the west. I set off to investigate, leaving the mud and crossing into deep rustling leaves, the knee-high brambles catching at my laces. I clock the distinctive jagged outline of the leaf of a wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), a signifier of ancient woodland and proof that some of the more fussy or enigmatic species still survive. Reaching the edge, I peer through the blackthorn hedge at an expansive open quarry, as, on cue, a lorry piled high with buff rocks grinds past on the adjacent dirt track, trundling noisily off into the distance. Quarrying returned to the ironstone strata in 2017, this time for construction. The song may have changed but the principle remains – wildlife can thrive after mineral extraction. Unfortunately, under current plans, most of the new quarry area would be returned to arable, missing the opportunity to boost the tree cover and carbon storage."
"With their ability to glide silently through snow drifts and vanish into forests, mountain caribou have been called the grey ghosts of western Canada’s alpine region. But in recent years, a steep drop in their population has raised fears the knobby-kneed ungulates may disappear forever. The rapid decline of mountain caribou has alarmed both biologists and government officials and prompted an aggressive response. In 2015, British Columbia placed a bounty on wolves, which the province believed to be a key threat to the ailing herds. The sanctioned cull is estimated to have killed more than a thousand of the apex predators. But a new study from the University of Alberta suggests that the cull is doing little to save the most vulnerable caribou populations. For decades, the mountain caribou – an ecotype of woodland caribou that once ranged from Alaska down to Montana and Idaho – has suffered catastrophic decline. Biologists have long suspected habitat degradation and increased predation were to blame. In addition to clearcutting forests, human incursions into the hinterlands – by snowmobile and ski trails – have created corridors for wolves to more easily stalk caribou. Today, roughly 46,800 mountain caribou remain. Both the central and southern mountain ecotypes are considered endangered, with only 1,825 remaining. They now only live in British Columbia after having effectively disappeared from the United States. In 2019, an influential study suggested that culling wolves and creating fenced refuges for pregnant females could help stem the demise of mountain caribou. The government of British Columbia cited the paper’s findings to establish an expanded wolf cull, believed to have killed more than 460 wolves in the last year – part of the province’s multimillion-dollar caribou recovery plan. But after running their own simulations, a team of researchers at the University of Alberta concluded that killing wolves wasn’t saving the caribou in areas where caribou were most vulnerable and at risk. In a new paper, published in the journal Biology and Conservation, the researchers used the same data results from the 2019 paper, but added a null model – a “self-check” meant to determine if a pattern is real, or just part of a random variation – to their statistical analysis of areas where caribou are declining. The team could find no statistical support for claims that culling wolves and penning in pregnant caribou offset population decline – especially in the most vulnerable cases. In the case of the endangered Wells Grey herd in central British Columbia, which has suffered one of the worst population declines, the researchers found that wolves weren’t even a major predator: bears, cougars and wolverines were far more deadly. “The [2019 study] cannot be considered sufficient to make far-reaching decisions on killing animals and where to place conservation priorities,” concluded University of Alberta’s Toby Spribille, a biologist and co-author of the new paper. Spribille anticipates the findings will generate controversy, largely because in some cases, killing wolves has been shown to save caribou and increase herd numbers. “I have no doubt that the [original] authors, in response, will find examples of cases where a wolf is pursuing a caribou and you shoot that wolf, it saves the life of that caribou,” he said. “Does that mean that can be scaled up to herds where wolves are not even a major predation issue? Does that mean it can be scaled up to a province wolf cull programme?” Environmental groups opposed to the cull have welcomed the findings. Wolves have been an easy villain, but a focus on predation ignores a more complex web of factors in the decline of the caribou, they argue. “When you remove top level apex predators, like wolves, you see a collapse of ecosystems from insects to riparian areas, to the predator prey relationship to the forest cover itself,” said Ian McAllister, executive director at Pacific Wild, a conservation organisation. “Wolves in every meaning of the word are being used as a scapegoat for government negligence.” Spribille and his colleagues believe habitat degradation, in the form of clear-cut logging practices, inflicts far greater harm on the caribou. By chopping down old trees, loggers remove critical food sources, as well as valuable shelter. It takes roughly 80 years for a forest to mature to the point that it produces a suitable amount of lichen, says Spribille, the main staple of the mountain caribou. A study published in May found that over the last five years, the British Columbia government has permitted more than 900 sq km of land to be logged, despite the forests being listed as critical caribou habitat. In the last year, 314 logging cut-blocks have been approved in areas where the caribou are most vulnerable. Spribille, who comes from a small community in the region where forestry is a large industry, understands the tensions and difficulties that many face in confronting the reality that human action plays an outsized role in the decline of caribou. “When you talk about habitat degradation, you’re talking about people’s livelihoods. I understand that things like this are going to be controversial,” he said. But, he added: “If we’re serious about mountain caribou, we’re going to have to address the complexity of this problem. And that means we’re going to have to have some uncomfortable conversations.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"It slipped by reasonably quietly amid the Covid-19 chaos, but earlier this month the Coalition government received something it has found hard to come by in its nearly seven years in power – praise on an environmental issue. The praise was qualified, and could yet be retracted. It followed the environment minister, Sussan Ley, announcing the government would spend $190m on new recycling infrastructure, saying it would help divert 10,000 tonnes of plastic, paper and glass waste from landfill. The funding is expected to be matched by the states, though the breakdown of that is yet to be explained, and by the waste industry, forming a $600m “recycling modernisation fund” to help build infrastructure Australia needs to sort rubbish so that it is not contaminated and can be turned into useful products. The government also said it planned to change laws covering “product stewardship”, which are meant to ensure manufacturers and retailers take responsibility for the products they sell once they become waste. It said companies that failed to comply would be “named and shamed” and it would become easier for consumers to recycle electronic goods. Grants were promised from a $20m fund to help businesses take greater responsibility for products across their lifespan. Waste and recycling organisations and environment groups agree these were significant steps towards addressing what is widely agreed to be a crisis within the industry. They also agree it will fall short of what is promised unless the government ensures there is much greater demand for recycled material. The Boomerang Alliance of 52 environment and community groups wrote to Ley and the assistant minister for waste reduction, Trevor Evans, welcoming the move to legislate, including a suggestion that new laws would introduce potential jail terms for companies that breached the government plan. The centrepiece of the plan is a staged ban on exporting waste glass, plastic tyres and paper. But the alliance’s director, Jeff Angel, said the measures needed to go further, including powers for the minister to make the use of recycled content in packaging compulsory, rather than relying on the goodwill of companies. The most recent official data suggests only 16% of plastic packaging is recycled, with the rest going to landfill. He also called for honesty in labelling “so that packaging products labelled as reusable, recyclable or compostable actually are reused, recycled or composted – something obviously still not happening”. “We look forward to legislation meeting the challenge of stopping waste and setting Australia onto the path of much higher levels of recycling,” Angel wrote. “Undoubtedly greater employment, new manufacturing industry and improved environmental performance of our economy will follow.” The seed of the government’s recycling announcement was planted more than two years ago, when China introduced what, by Australian standards, was an unattainable limit on the level of contaminated material it would accept in shipments of foreign plastic waste. It threw the global waste and recycling trade into chaos. Australian companies redirected recyclable material to south-east Asia, but in 2019 more countries began turning back containers of recyclable rubbish, declaring they would not be dumping grounds. Australia was caught unprepared. Compared with other developed economies, it generates more waste than average and recycles less. Australia had exported about 4.5m tonnes of waste to Asia each year, mostly to Vietnam, Indonesia and China. As waste companies struggled to find new buyers, the Victorian operator SKM went into administration and warned up to 180,000 tonnes of recyclable material would go to landfill. Scott Morrison responded last August with a promise of a ban of his own. Speaking after a meeting with state premiers, he said too much rubbish was ending up in the oceans and promised Australia would respond by stopping the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres “as soon as practicable”. The pledge became the centrepiece of an address to the UN general assembly in New York when, facing criticism over his government’s intransigence on the climate crisis, he declared Australia was “acting to protect our oceans” and leading on practical research and development into recycling. Experts said this was not yet true, but welcomed the intent. Responding to the government’s funding announcement, the Australian Council of Recycling, which represents about 70 companies, said it was a “massive milestone” that would help transform recycling. But its chief, Pete Shmigel, says dealing with soft plastics – the type you can crunch up into your hand and that are collected at supermarkets – remains a major challenge. He says there are likely solutions for some recyclable material – technology could be attached to paper mills to help deal with contamination from paper clips, nappies and plastic bottles, for example – but there are few plants to deal with soft plastics and little-to-no market for them once recovered. He says this could be addressed by requiring the use of recycled material not just in packaging, but also road building and major construction projects. “The truth is we have virtually no market for it. We need to create infrastructure to turn the soft plastics to resin and come up with places that will use it,” he says. “If we did two major road projects in every constituency across the country we could double the percentage of soft plastics being recycled and reduce oil use. Obviously, that would be a good thing.” Shmigel says companies can be encouraged to boost recycling content in a number of ways, citing Britain and France’s use of tax credits for those that use recycled goods. He suggests a different approach for Australia: a declaration that recycled goods would be used to build one multibillion-dollar piece of infrastructure, such as the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro development or the western Sydney airport. “They could just say ‘this is where we are going to demonstrate how easy it is to use recycled material’,” he says. “If you did that, then other states and local governments would have an example and see it wasn’t so hard.” The industry argues heading down this path makes sense both economically and politically. Shmigel says there are three times as many jobs in recycling as in landfill for the same amount of waste, and suggests the success of the ABC documentary series War on Waste demonstrated people want to do more. “It’s popular. If voting wasn’t compulsory more people would recycle than vote,” he says. But he says individuals also have a responsibility – that people need to move from just thinking about recycling after they use something to thinking about whether they are buying recycled goods when they are shopping. Angel says the goal must be a circular economy, a term still little used in Australia but common in the European Union, with all parts of the community and economy headed in the same direction. He warns against this including plans to burn more waste to create energy, a path he says creates pollution and greenhouse gas and is little better than sending it to landfill. He says it requires the government to introduce mandatory procurement of recycled goods by its departments and agencies, and notes state and federal environment ministers have previously suggested they may make action mandatory if the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, representing more than 900m companies, did not show it could meet recycling targets. The Morrison government is resisting, preferring – as it does on climate change policy – taxpayer-funded incentives over compulsion. It says businesses and households will not accept greater regulation, particularly during a recession. Angel believes this does not bode well. “The problem with the current approach is you end up with pilots and case studies, you don’t end up with markets,” he says. “There is a reason we have container deposit schemes that are mandatory. It’s because all the decades of voluntary schemes failed.”"
"At the entrance to Saltend Chemicals Park, on the outskirts of Hull, there is a small blue heritage-style plaque, placed there four years ago by the Royal Society of Chemistry. It proudly commemorates: “100 years of innovation in supplying the UK with transportation fuels and important base chemicals.” A sense of pride in Saltend’s past is understandable: places like this helped drive Britain’s industrial age. But the biggest, most dramatic innovation of all may be yet to come. This month, the Norwegian energy company, Equinor, (formerly Statoil), unveiled proposals to install the biggest facility in the world for making hydrogen from natural gas, using capture and storage technology to extract and bury the resulting carbon under the North Sea. The Humber region is currently the biggest emitter of carbon in Britain and the second-highest emitter in Europe. Equinor’s plan, if it goes ahead, would amount to a green revolution at Saltend, allowing businesses on the site to convert to clean energy. And if the rest of the region follows suit, by 2030 this windblown stretch of North Sea coastline could conceivably be one of the world’s leading green energy hubs. “This is a plan,” suggests Al Cook, the head of Equinor’s English operations, “which would help transform the UK’s largest industrial cluster into its greenest cluster. We are one of the largest energy producers in the world. Saltend is one of the oldest industrial hubs of its kind. Humberside has all the natural resources required on its doorstep. It is a chance for the UK to get on the front foot in the green energy race.” Get ready for Britain’s hydrogen boom? Definitely maybe. Hydrogen has been the next big thing for longer than its advocates would care to remember. Before Elon Musk, Tesla and electric battery technology, it was commonly assumed that we might all, one day, be driving hydrogen cars. The traditional drawback for investors has been the expensive complexity of actually producing the stuff. But in an era of net zero carbon emissions targets, the green utility of the most common chemical element in the universe is turning it into one of the most fashionable products on earth. “Blue” hydrogen – the kind Equinor hopes to produce in Hull – can be made almost carbon-free from natural gas, by using the capture and storage technology. For groups such as Friends of the Earth, “almost” is not good enough, and the enormous cost of capture and storage has also generated scepticism. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, which is made from renewable sources, bypasses fossil fuels altogether. Both types can be stored and kept in reserve, to be deployed as an inter-seasonal fuel supplementing wind and solar power. Hydrogen, its supporters claim, can also heat homes and workplaces, distributed through the existing infrastructure of the National Grid. It can be used to de-carbonise trains and buses and provide green fuel for heavy-duty vehicles, for which electric-battery technology is impractical. In synthetic form, hydrogen could even help fly zero-carbon planes. All of which led the European Union’s green deal supremo, Frans Timmermans, to tweet this month: “Hydrogen rocks, and I am committed to making it a success.” Presenting an EU strategy aimed at producing 10 million tonnes of H2 by 2030, Timmermans said: “The new hydrogen economy can be a growth engine to help overcome the economic damage caused by Covid-19.” Germany has announced a massive £9bn investment plan. Peter Altmaier, the German minister for economic affairs and energy, explained the logic: “In adopting the hydrogen strategy, we are paving the way for Germany to become the world leader in the field of hydrogen technologies.” In Britain’s energy sector, as other countries invest in the hope of a virtuous cycle of green growth, there is a growing nervousness. Having led the way in early wind farm technology, the UK failed to capitalise and become a major manufacturer and exporter. In the electric car industry, it has fallen far behind Germany and other competitors after failing to invest enough in battery production capacity. Equinor has made it clear that it will only proceed with its blue hydrogen plans for Hull if the government plays its part, sharing the risks of investing in a fledgling industry. “All our experience,” says Cook, “tells us that in projects of this scale and ambition, it only works when governments and companies work together. We will need clear frameworks and assurances and a commitment to investment from London.” Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge, is the deputy chair of the Committee on Climate Change, and one of the country’s most influential backers of hydrogen. She believes that if Britain acts decisively now, it can take a giant step towards meeting the legal requirement for net zero emissions by 2050 and become a world leader in a lucrative new market. “It is urgent for the UK to get on with this,” said King. “In terms of hydrogen technology, we have a very strong position at the moment. In electrolysis, in storage technology and other areas, we have really dynamic companies which we need to help grow.” Britain also enjoys a natural advantage, she points out: the winds that blow in from the North Sea and can be turned into green hydrogen. “This country has the best offshore wind resource in Europe. We have all the ingredients to make this an industry which the UK is really successful at; one which will reduce our emissions and which will provide real export opportunities for cutting-edge technologies. “We could also be selling into a huge export market for hydrogen. We could even get to the position of being sellers of electrolytic hydrogen to Germany.” None of this is likely to happen, though, without significant government intervention, both to lend confidence and to help shape an industry which, at the moment, barely exists. “The challenge is that we’ve actually got to create both supply and demand,” says King. “There’s no point in producing hydrogen unless you have a way of using it. And there’s no point in developing buses, trains and so on unless somebody is going to be able to supply hydrogen to you. “We need the government to form something like a hydrogen industry council to bring the demand and supply side players together to discuss how to start the industry. And, obviously, it would be helpful to know that there would be money available. When I was on the board of the green investment bank, one of the things we saw was the confidence that government gave when it came to investing in early offshore wind. Having government as the lead investor brings in other investors.” Conservative governments are generally averse to a hands-on approach to industrial strategy. With hydrogen, it might be different. Potentially, this is a red wall success story in the making. As King points out: “A successful hydrogen strategy would not be about jobs in Oxford, Cambridge and London. It would be about developing the regions where we bring energy from wind onshore; about places like Hull and Grimsby and all the other places along the coast that have had a really rough time and are in desperate need of an uplift.” After Equinor unveiled its proposals for Saltend, the headline in the Hull Daily Mail read: “Humber hydrogen plant could create 5,000 jobs.” Further up the north-east coast, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, has led a successful bid for a £1.3m grant to build refuelling stations for hydrogen vehicles. Following last December’s unprecedented string of victories in Labour strongholds, Conservative MPs are now installed in five of the eight seats in the Tees Valley. Houchen has called for the region to be turned into a UK hydrogen powerhouse. The new network of influence is making its presence felt in parliament. One of the refuelling stations will be in Redcar, a seat won for the first time for the Conservatives last December by Jacob Young. Young is the chair of the cross-party MPs working group on hydrogen which was set up in 2018. Alexander Stafford, the MP for Rother Valley – where the Battle of Orgreave took place during the miners’ strike – is another hydrogen advocate. “It would be a great thing,” said Stafford, who sits on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, “if the areas which played such a big part in energy production in the industrial age could now play a new role in producing the energy of the future.” In its latest report, the group calls for the government to urgently set out a national hydrogen strategy, “or risk falling behind”. Given the huge lead enjoyed by countries such as Germany and Japan in electric battery production, says Stafford, “if you are looking to invest, it is far better to look in the direction of hydrogen than at batteries. The whole world is heading towards becoming carbon neutral, with some countries moving quicker than others. So the question is, how can the UK get on the front foot with hydrogen? If it can do so, there will be enormous dividends.” According to King, positive signals have come from the minister for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng. King is hopeful that a strategy will be unveiled before parliament goes into recess at the end of July. “There’s much more agreement now about where hydrogen will play a role,” she says. “In the past, it started out mainly being about light-duty vehicles. It is understood now that hydrogen is about trains, buses, industrial processes and so on.” The stakes could scarcely be higher. Given its lacklustre performance in wind and batteries, if Britain is to emerge from the Covid-19 crisis into a meaningful green recovery that generates growth, hydrogen could be key. The Committee for Climate Change has estimated that a developed hydrogen system could eventually contribute a similar amount of energy to the UK economy as the electricity industry does today. The EU envisions 25% of energy coming from hydrogen by 2050. As governments take the plunge, private investors are placing their bets. The share price of the Sheffield firm, ITM Power, which produces green hydrogen technology, has risen by 1,500% in just over a year. In places like Hull, the green future can’t come soon enough. A few days after Equinor made its pitch on Saltend, a Social Market Foundation study placed the city at the top of the list of places that will find it hardest to bounce back from the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. Mike Ross, now a Lib Dem councillor, came to the city 20 years ago as a student. He has banged the drum for green investment in Hull for years. “We became the forgotten city of the floods in 2007. Then there was the crash, and then 10 years of austerity which hit places like this hardest. After Covid, there must be a special effort. This city must not be forgotten about again.” If Hull really does become a vanguard city in a hydrogen revolution, it won’t be."
"Marbled white butterflies are resting on the flower heads, stretching out their chequered wings towards the early-morning sun in ritualistic greeting, warming themselves at the start of the day. Nearby, the orange and black caterpillars of cinnabar moths feed on groups of tall, yellow-flowered common ragwort plants. Song thrushes and greenfinches sing from the tops of the trees bending in the breeze. Leaves shake with parties of adult birds and their young. I watch three chiffchaffs chase each other in and out of the branches, over the brambles and back up the trees. A male common redstart lands on a shining barbed wire fence before taking off again to catch small flies mid-air. A black and red cinnabar moth flutters across my path. I walk on and climb uphill through the woods towards the viewpoint that looks out across the northern brooks. Although many of the pools have dried up around the reserve, there are still large areas of water here. Sitting along the edges, resting, are mallard ducks and lapwings, Canada, greylag and Egyptian geese, black-tailed godwits and seven avocets. Avocets have bred at Pulborough for the first time on record this year – two pairs nested but only one pair was successful, fledging four birds. The elegant black and white waders recolonised Britain in the 1940s, but didn’t return to breed in Sussex until 1979. Since then, breeding numbers have risen from about 10 pairs 20 years ago to 100 or so across a handful of coastal sites, mainly around Rye Bay and Pagham and Chichester harbours. Two of the avocets are now standing on one leg and preening. They sway their tall necks from one side to the other, using the mandibles of their long, black, upturned bills to coat their feathers and skin with the oily substance that they secrete from the uropygial gland. This keeps the feathers in good condition – if left untended they can become brittle and damaged – and, together with realigning the feathers to ensure the barbules remain interlocked, water-repellant. It is also thought the secretion may protect against microbes. The other avocets have woken up, and are also starting to preen. The black-tailed godwits wade into the brown water to feed, their reddish necks glowing in the low sun. "
"The past few months showed us something that many thought we’d never see in our lifetimes: empty roads. Miles of asphalt without a single vehicle to spoil the view. Parked cars gathered dust, multi-storeys were deserted and garages shuttered. As lockdown eased, cars started to fill our streets again. But the great hiatus provided a glimpse into an alternative future. Some cities, such as Milan, have already stated that they want to make permanent the changes brought about by the pandemic, and there have been calls across Britain for more space for walking and cycling. The warning lights signalling the end of the car’s total dominance over the way we travel and the way we plan cities are now flashing. For the past 15 years, I have been the Observer’s motoring editor. Like so many other things, the pandemic brought my weekly column to a juddering halt. Though environmental concerns also played a factor in its demise, it’s hard to review cars if you can’t drive anywhere, despite the temptation of those blissfully empty roads.  What does looking back over 15 years of reviewing cars tell me about motoring’s next chapter? The automobile has dramatically transformed our lives since its invention. Steam-powered and even hydrogen-driven automobiles can be dated to the 1770s, but 1886 is generally regarded as the “birth year” of the modern motor. That was when Karl Benz patented his first Motorwagen. There are now 1.3bn cars on the world’s roads.  In terms of captivating design coupled with brilliant technology, the last half-century has surely been the car’s golden age. If you regard motor manufacturing as an artform, these past decades will be seen as the automobile’s high mark, its Renaissance era, as one game-changing advance was piled on another. But a glance in your rearview mirror will tell you that this period will also be known as the last time cars could be driven with a clear conscience, a time of motoring innocence before driving became so compromised; freighted with the knowledge that these beautiful machines were wrecking our planet. Guilt has never made for an amenable passenger, and the pumping soundtrack of a gurgling V8 soon starts to sound like a death rattle. I’ve loved cars for as long as I can remember. My mother has a picture of me as a toddler sitting on my potty, knock-kneed and in red sandals, earnestly parking my fleet of colourful Dinky toy cars. I then grew up and through my job found myself at the wheel of the real-life versions of the same models I’d been playing with. As a journalist, I drove everything from the first Series 1 1948 Land Rover Defender, with its famous registration plate HUE 166, to the last Jaguar E-Type to roll off the production line in Coventry in 1974. I drove around Le Mans in a vintage 1954 racing car with the grandson of William Lyons, the founder of Jaguar. I drove a one-off futuristic VW prototype with consumption figures so low you could go from London to Edinburgh on little more than a sip of fuel. There were Minis and Mondeos, Fiats and Ferraris, MPVs, SUVs, ATVs… I remember thinking it was funny to take an Aston Martin to a McDonald’s drive-thru, only to see there was a Lamborghini in the queue behind me. I took our household rubbish to the council tip in a Rolls-Royce – and was cheered by the workers there. I’ve long been dazzled by the car’s mechanical mastery of the multiple threats of travelling at speed with a tank of highly flammable liquid in the back. I’m amazed you can drive in comfort over frozen tundra or across a scorching desert with your paint job remaining immaculate through a swing of 60C. Why doesn’t it all just flake off? Cars give us limitless freedom. They’re our escape pods, parked on permanent standby.  So what’s going to happen to them now? The next generation of motorists will see transformative technology once again reinvent vehicles. But how quickly will it happen? Will we soon be driven by fleets of self-piloted zombie cars? When autonomous cars finally become the norm, a point which is nowhere near as tantalisingly close as some suggest, one of the biggest changes will be the reduction in the number of fatal accidents. It will become almost impossible to die in a crash.  It won’t just be lives that are saved, either. Autonomy will create efficiencies in many ways. These vehicles won’t be owned – we will rent them by the hour or day, which means we won’t need so many. and our streets won’t be so clogged with underused cars. Traffic lights, road signs and markings will become unnecessary – the cars know where they are going. Our cities will be quieter and cleaner. Our built environment will be less dominated by the infrastructure of the road. The elderly, infirm and even visually impaired will be able to enjoy driving without depending on taxis or other people. Autonomous cars will be far more energy efficient, too. Some studies estimate that fuel use will fall by at least a quarter. It all sounds pretty good, but this auto-utopia is still a long way from reality. There are so many obstacles to overcome. First up there is cost. Superfast sensors, lasers and cameras don’t come cheap. Then there is safety. On average, a vehicle in the UK is involved in a fatal crash once in every 200 million miles. This gives you a clue as to the phenomenal scale of testing that autonomous systems will have to undergo before we as humans will be prepared to hand over the steering wheel to a computer. What about insurance? If there is a crash, who and what is responsible? The mapping providers? The GPS system? The robo-pilot? Will our premiums drop? What about our no-claims bonus? In theory, any car can be modified to be self-driving. But for some reason, we tend to pair autonomy with electric vehicles. Battery technology, despite being around for more than a century, is still in its infancy. As the uptake of electric cars increases so their power packs will become smarter, more productive and more efficient. The lack of fast chargers and anxiety over range will cease to be an issue. Clearly, we are in dire need of more public charging points, and the uptake of electric vehicles won’t truly get into its stride without the installation of thousands of easy-to-access charge sites across the UK. But a lack of petrol stations didn’t stop Henry Ford rolling out his world-beating Model T. He once famously said: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” A ban on all new sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2035 will focus our minds. But how ethical and sustainable is the production of an EV? The manufacture of the cars – and particularly the essential minerals for the batteries, often mined in countries with poor environmental records and even worse abuses of their labour force – is anything but green. Swapping an internal combustion engine for an electric motor is only a short-term fix. Are we, in fact, just kicking our problems down the street? Of all the scenarios about what we’ll be driving in the coming years, the one I find most plausible is that many of us will actually choose not to drive at all. In some ways, it’ll be a relief. Commuter constipation, motorway standstills and city gridlock all mean that driving now is often just a frustrating nightmare. Before the lockdown, Birmingham – once, proudly, the UK’s “motorway city” – had already announced plans to entice people out of their cars and on to bikes and buses, and on to their feet. If Birmingham goes ahead, it will join areas of York, Bath, Sheffield, Leeds, Edinburgh and Brighton among others, which have already experimented with car-free days. Bristol has announced plans to ban diesel soon. Further afield, Madrid has banned older cars from its centre, and Paris is following a similar route. The sustainable transport charity Sustrans estimates that of the 6.8 million private vehicle trips that were made daily in Greater London, 4.2 million could be walked or cycled. It’s ironic that the answer to all our car problems might be as simple as more of us turning off our engines, getting out – and simply using our own legs."
"Returning an area the size of Dorset to wild nature, reintroducing extinct lynx, pelicans and beavers and championing regenerative farming to restore soil health are the radical aims of a new charitable foundation. But the most revolutionary feature of WildEast may be that it is founded by three farmers in the most intensively farmed region of Britain. Hugh Somerleyton, Argus Hardy and Olly Birkbeck, who own more than 3,200 hectares (8,000 acres) on their family farms in Suffolk and Norfolk, are seeking to persuade farmers and also councils, businesses, schools and ordinary people across East Anglia to pledge a fifth of their land to wildlife. WildEast aims to dedicate 250,000 hectares of East Anglia to wildlife over the next 50 years while also working with schools to enhance children’s knowledge of farming and wildlife and creating an accreditation system to boost wildlife-friendly farmers. “We want to wake up the regional collective consciousness,” said Lord Somerleyton. “If you’re prepared to rewild 20% of your backyard, that humbles the farmer because you’re not getting a grant for it. We in the east want to do it together and not wait for the government.” WildEast has already gathered support from farmers of all sizes from across East Anglia including vicars, teachers, grassroots conservation projects and industrial estate owners. According to Somerleyton, who is creating a 400-hectare fenced enclosure of wood pasture, restored grassland and heathland with free-roaming large black pigs and Exmoor ponies on his 2,000-hectare estate, the old EU subsidy system in effect paid farmers to give about 4% of their land to wildlife. The government’s new post-Brexit support system of “public money for public goods” could support farmers to turn 10% of their holdings over to wildlife but Somerleyton said farmers needed to reverse postwar losses in biodiversity without subsidies. Somerleyton said farmers had remained relatively unscathed while manufacturing endured huge upheavals in recent decades. “We’ve been driving around in Range Rovers and going on skiing holidays. In East Anglia it’s been very rewarding being in agriculture. I sound like I’m biting the hand that feeds me but we have been very protected from the troubles of other industries. The awful thing is that protection, not deliberately, has accelerated nature decline. Farmers have become pretty grant-dependent. This movement is about trying to move the needle.” Hardy said WildEast was not about chastising farmers but seeking nature restoration in “churchyards, barnyards and backyards” and nurturing dialogue and change across society, including consumers who buy cheap meat that is farmed indoors. Britain slaughters nearly 1 billion chickens each year. Hardy said: “There’s a lot of blame put on farmers. They are seen as the people who need to make the change. WildEast is about broadening the focus – it’s about all of us, our gardens, how people are eating, what people are eating, and local food markets.” Restoring wildlife is “not stopping farming, it’s fitting farming systems into natural systems so we can restore biodiversity”, added Hardy. “It’s not rewilding, it’s making things wilder – not to create space for nature but to find out how we live inside the ecosystem. We don’t want anyone to visit a nature reserve, we want you to live in one.” Despite being a sheep farmer, Hardy said he would be happy to farm alongside reintroduced lynx. “We have to accept what’s here and what was here,” he said. “Far more sheep are killed by parasites than lynx, where they are present in natural ecosystems. Worms are a much greater threat.” According to Somerleyton, many farmers have been inspired by Isabella Tree’s book Wilding, which tells how she and her husband, Charlie Burrell, returned Knepp, their 1,400-hectare farm to nature, farming organic meat from free-ranging deer, cows and pigs. Although their West Sussex farm has since benefited from a surge in tourism, Somerleyton said the Knepp model was not applicable to every farmer. Somerleyton, who founded the restaurant chain Dish Dash before returning to his family estate, said he was “very aware” that smaller farmers did not share his willingness to devote large tracts of less fertile soils to wildlife, or diversify his income with tourism and gastropubs, but said a region-wide WildEast accreditation system could help small, eco-friendly producers. WildEast hopes that its new accreditation system will help East Anglian farmers using restorative agriculture – with long rotations that revive soil and micro-organisms – or high-welfare, natural outdoor grazing find markets and obtain higher prices for their food. Somerleyton said his 100 herd of outdoor, free-living cattle produced too much meat for his pubs “but far too [little] to satisfy Waitrose. If there’s a growing band of WildEast producers, together we can feed a market”. Somerleyton said there had been “a lot of head-scratching” by farmers responding to WildEast. According to Hardy, who is also an architect, many have a cautious attitude of “we’ll just watch and see what comes out of your harvest”. But Birkbeck, who has restored a 200-hectare heathland that was ploughed up during the second world war on his west Norfolk farm, said a younger generation of farmers was increasingly aware that they needed to move away from chemical-dependent farming, with protection for soils and predatory insects that regulate pests. He said: “Farmers are beginning to realise that they have a moral duty to protect the countryside that they are dependent on – that we have to work with nature rather than shut it out, because it will find you out in the end. We’ve tidied nature up and swept it away in the last 40 years. If we can only get back to accepting mess again we’d be getting somewhere. We’ve started WildEast to make that conversation public.” WildEast supporters include the Chet Valley B-line, a more than 10-mile (17km) corridor of pollinator-friendly habitat, and the Suffolk pig farmers Dingley Dell, who sow wildflower strips alongside their outdoor pig pens, creating a habitat for more than a million bees. “Get 1,000 people to do that and it’s a billion-bee project,” said Hardy. The new charity is developing an app so people can add their wilding pledges to “a map of dreams”, whether it is restoring an old pond or creating a hedgehog- and slug-friendly garden. WildEast hopes councils will get involved: for instance, derelict land earmarked for industrial estates in towns such as Lowestoft could be given planning consent with 20% set aside for natural ecosystems. WildEast is also devising an education programme for interested schools, and is encouraging dialogue via #mywildeast on social media, even producing a TikTok video. “We’re trying to reach out on various platforms, however clumsily,” said Hardy. “It’s not about rewilding nature, it’s about rewilding ourselves.”"
"Lingering in the shallows of a south Norfolk pond, voracious amphibians are resting ahead of a night gorging on slugs, worms and insects. The pool network, long grasses and shrubs in Silfield newt reserve are a perfect habitat for the great crested newt – the pantomime villain for housing developers. The UK’s largest newt, which takes its name from the striking, jagged crest that males display in the spring breeding season, is a protected species under British law, thanks to the the EU habitats directive, which the prime minister’s father, Stanley Johnson, had a key role in creating. Despite that, its numbers have declined rapidly over the past 60 years. But measures to protect the great crested newt have become a problem, according to Boris Johnson. “Newt-counting delays are a massive drag on the prosperity of this country,” the prime minister declared last Friday, urging the UK to “build, build, build” its way out of the economic catastrophe the pandemic has caused. An unlimited fine and up to six months in prison await anyone found guilty of disturbing the newt’s resting places and breeding sites or taking their eggs, yet the Local Government Association says it is not aware of any evidence to suggest “newt-counting” is causing delays to housing developments in England and Wales. “Great crested newts have become the comedy pantomime villain of nature conservation,” says Jeremy Biggs, director of the Freshwater Habitats Trust. Developers are obliged to take care of great crested newts if the amphibians are believed to be on site or nearby under rules overseen by Natural England. Until the last few years, protecting the amphibians when their habitats were being destroyed by developments centred on catching and counting them and moving them to compensation ponds. This process led to frequent complaints from Conservative ministers. In 2015, for example, when the then transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin expressed frustration at delays to the building of Ilkeston railway station in Derbyshire, after newts were found on site.  Great crested newts were mentioned eight times in Sajid Javid’s white paper Fixing Our Broken Housing Market, published in 2017 under Theresa May’s government. The paper criticised the “excessive bureaucracy” involved in their protection. But a fresh approach to the conservation of great crested newts by Natural England and the use of new technologies when surveying habitats, such as eDNA analysis and even, in the case of one water company, the use of a springer spaniel trained to detect the amphibians, has rapidly reduced delays. Natural England is rolling out a new district-level licensing system that allows developers to avoid a bespoke survey while meeting obligations by making a conservation payment. Money raised from the scheme has been used to create or restore hundreds of ponds. Before this approach, says Biggs: “A lot of the mitigation work being done just wasn’t good quality habitat, either terrestrial or aquatic, so the newts died anyway.” In the southern Midlands, the Freshwater Habitats Trust is involved with NatureSpace, which developers pay into in order to meet newt protection rules. Builders pay a fee to the conservation scheme based on the destruction their projects will cause to habitats. “The counting is not really a delay issue any more,” Biggs says. “It takes them 10 days to sign the forms and join the scheme. We, in the background, have been making the habitats in advance and they are funding the conservation work. “We’re creating a new network of habitats across the countryside that the newts can spread into.” As developers smell victory in their decades-long battle with the great crested newt with the post-Brexit tearing up of regulations, conservationists have urged the government to make sure the country’s economic and environmental ambitions are not in competition. As Stanley Johnson once said: “The Spanish have the lynx, the Romanians and Slovenians have wolves, elsewhere in Europe there are bears. I think we should be proud of our great crested newt. I hope this element of EU environment law doesn’t take too much of a pounding.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"Environment groups are increasingly anxious and frustrated as they wait for the release of an interim report from a review of Australia’s national environmental laws. The review’s chair, the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, handed his report to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, almost three weeks ago. It had been due for release shortly after that but the government pushed back its publication, which is now expected sometime next week. “When the review was announced, Minister Ley was very clear that this was meant to be an independent report. But when the report is delayed by government, questions naturally arise about how independent that process is,” said Suzanne Milthorpe, the national environmental law campaign manager at the Wilderness Society. “If they are serious about this, they should release it so that all Australians can see and engage with the findings of this report.” The review of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is a once-in-a-decade statutory requirement. It has the potential to shape policy for the next 10 years in an area that is highly politicised. The interim report and its recommendations will inform the next period of public consultation before Samuel delivers a final report in October. In submissions to the review, environmental and industry groups have put forward proposals that involve the development of national environmental standards. They agree Australia’s environment is in decline, but they hold different views on what a set of national standards might look like. Industry continues to advocate for reductions in environmental regulation, while conservationists have called for stronger protection and an independent national environmental authority. Just this week, Australia’s oil and gas lobby, APPEA, called for regulatory reform, and in particular the cutting of so-called environmental “green tape”, to support economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Its chief executive, Andrew McConville, told Guardian Australia the organisation “broadly supports a focus on setting clear expectations for protection, rather than focusing on prescription, and this should be supported by all parties”. “Setting clear expectations improves certainty for business, environmental groups and the community,” he said. James Trezise of the Australian Conservation Foundation said a recent national audit office report that examined the assessment and approval of projects under the act had identified serious failures in governance. That included findings that the government had been ineffective in managing risks to the environment and had failed to ensure developers were meeting the environmental conditions of their project approvals. Trezise said reforms were needed to ensure Australia’s laws were better focused on delivering outcomes for the environment and that one way of achieving that was “through setting clear national standards” for environmental protection. “The government has flagged an intention to rush through deregulation reform, but hasn’t outlined how it will actually address the significant environmental challenges Australia faces,” he said. “Australians across the political spectrum care about our incredible wildlife. We need to have a national discussion across sectors about how to protect our environment and we can’t have that while the government sits on the interim report.” A spokesman for Ley said it was appropriate the government had taken time to assess the contents of the report. “The minister has consistently highlighted the need to ensure strong environmental protection and to ensure our environmental laws are delivering that outcome,” he said. Reporting by Guardian Australia has examined systemic failings under the act. It has uncovered widespread problems, including major delays in the listing of threatened species and ecosystems; failure to develop, update and implement recovery plans for species and habitats threatened with extinction; failure to list key threats to species; and failure to protect important habitat. Australia has the highest rate of mammalian extinction in the world and the government’s own State of the Environment report says threats are increasing and Australia’s environment has continued to decline. “The State of the Environment evaluation stands and, obviously, the bushfires have made things worse,” said Helene Marsh, the chair of the threatened species scientific committee which advises the government on the listing of species under the act. “I think we need more resources and we need to fund recovery in a much better way: more completely and more systematically.” The committee has put forward several recommendations to the review, including that governments take a regional approach to the recovery of endangered species to improve coordination. Last week, Ley made four additions to Australia’s list of threatened species and habitats. That included two first-time listings: the grey falcon, which was listed as vulnerable; and the Elderslie banksia scrub forest in Sydney, which was listed as critically endangered after a lengthy assessment process that began in 2011. Two other species, the shy albatross and the wet tropics subspecies of the yellow-bellied glider, had their protection status upgraded from vulnerable to endangered. Samantha Vine, the head of conservation at BirdLife Australia, said the list had become “a waiting room for extinction”. “The fact we keep adding to the list and that very few species, once they are on the list, come off or move to a less threatened category shows we’re not doing enough,” she said. But she said it was possible to change that. “Strong laws can and do recover threatened species, sometimes with quite spectacular results.”"
"A specialist search and recovery team has been deployed to recapture the last remaining survivors of a flock of endangered birds that absconded from a predator-free island in New Zealand during coronavirus lockdown. There are only 250 shore plover or tūturuatu left in the wild and they are the world’s rarest plover. Conservationists have been painstakingly reintroducing them to the mainland after they were almost wiped out by cats and rats by 1880. The birds survived for another 100 years in a remote colony on the Chatham Islands, 800km east of New Zealand. Shore plovers are endemic to New Zealand and renowned for their “attitude and friendliness” – traits which alongside their ground nests make them highly vulnerable to predators. Mana Island off the coast of the North Island’s Kapiti coast was a successful home to an introduced colony of plovers in 2007. But a few short years after being introduced a single rat wiped out half the population, with the rest dying shortly later due to “complications”. After the 2007 devastation conservationists avoided reintroducing the plover until the pest situation was resolved. But in April and May they again took the plunge, transporting 29 young birds to the island, some of whom required ministerial approval to travel during the Covid-19 lockdown. The birds were colour-banded but not tracked, the department of conservation (DoC) said, and it now appears nearly the entire population has again vanished: either having being killed by avian predators such as rūrū, or having flown off to the mainland. Shore plover recovery group leader Dave Houston from DoC said the birds’ mysterious disappearance was “frustrating”, as substantial time and money had gone into their recovery. Houston said his team were unsure what exactly had happened to 26 of the birds, though it had tracked three survivors to Plimmerton beach on the mainland, with a search and recovery team hoping to recapture them later this week. Reports from the public have been helping DoC keep tabs on the survivors. “The birds haven’t stayed at home like we hoped they would,” Houston said. “We honestly don’t know what is making them leave; but it could be that a single bird decided to fly to the mainland and everyone else followed them – it could be random behaviour, we’re not sure.” In past releases shore plovers had been found to fly as far south as Christchurch in the South Island, and despite their small size they showed considerable pluck, Houston said. “It is frustrating, we can give them strict instructions, but they choose not to obey. They are a challenging species to manage, so it’s a great loss to then lose them. But we persist.” If the three survivors are captured they will be returned to Mana Island and held in an aviary for a month rather the usual week to help them establish “fidelity” to the island, Houston said. Radio transmitters would also be attached to the birds so conservationists “can determine their fate … We might not find them at all though,” Houston mused. “They’re not very long-range transmitters.”"
"“You convince yourself that there is no danger,” Ron Taylor once said of how he captured his groundbreaking underwater footage of sharks. And afterwards, “You wonder how you got out of it alive.” In 1970, Australian divers Taylor and his wife, Valerie, set out with the directors Peter Gimbel and James Lipscomb on a global quest to find and film great white sharks. Even today, 50 years later, with sharks a familiar sight from our sofas, the footage the Taylors eventually succeeded in shooting is gripping. A scene where they film hundreds of oceanic whitetips feeding on a whale carcass – outside of a dive cage, for the first time ever – is especially hair-raising. The Taylors are surrounded on all sides by sharks, fending them off with their hands. Eventually, Valerie emerges at the surface, euphoric. “I nearly went berserk when I came out of the water,” she says, now 78, from her home in Sydney. “We’d done the impossible – and survived.” The New York Times’s review of Gimbel’s film, Blue Water, White Death, praised the “extraordinary beauty” of the underwater sequences. This, however, was the tagline for the poster: “The most smashing man-against-beast footage ever filmed.” For as long as humans have been able to photograph the oceans, we have sought to capture their most fearsome resident. The desire for shark footage long predates Jaws. But how to obtain it? Men Among Sharks, the 1947 film by the pioneering Austrian diver Hans Hass, shows him illegally blasting shoals of fish with dynamite to attract sharks. In his memoir, Hass described luring them by pretending to flee – “awakening the instinct in every beast of prey”. Jacques-Yves Cousteau, meanwhile, was experimenting with capturing the underwater world (using a camera sealed inside a modified preserve jar), and how to extend his time below the surface. In 1943, he trialled the first prototype aqualung. In his 1953 bestseller The Silent World, co-written with Frédéric Dumas, Cousteau shared photographs of “the beast”, an oceanic whitetip, coming straight for him: “Then I bang his nose with the camera.” In 1956, Cousteau and film-maker Louis Malle made a film of the same title that combined colour footage with swashbuckling bravado, including the on-screen slaughter of several sharks. National Geographic photographer David Doubilet, now 73, remembers “submerging into that film like a dream”, aged 10. Inspired, he made his own underwater camera by stuffing his Brownie Hawkeye into a rubber anaesthesia rebreathing bag. (He calls the resulting photographs “beyond abstract”.) Later, in the 1960s, he used a setup so primitive that he was forced make a tradeoff between controlling focus or light levels. Doubilet learned to rely on light, composition and “the decisive moment”. “Underwater photography was a battle,” he says. “You could ‘see’ the image you wanted to make, but the technology was not there to make it.” Ron Taylor shot his first underwater footage on 16mm film, using a wind-up camera in a waterproof housing. “All the action could be happening, and he couldn’t do a thing because he had to rewind the camera,” says Valerie. (Ron died from leukaemia in 2012, aged 78.) The couple had met through competitive spearfishing in 1962; Ron asked Valerie to model in his images, as Hass’s wife, Lotte, had also done. Taylor notes in her memoir, An Adventurous Life, the Jaws poster doesn’t “show a middle-aged man”. Ron and Valerie became partners in life and work, selling film of their underwater encounters to Movietone for its newsreels (at £25 a pop, good money at the time) then, later, to television channels in the US and Australia. Sharks proved the moneymaker of the pair’s nascent business, with networks taking any footage they could get – especially if the animals appeared dangerous. “Sharks would sell, and we had to make a living,” says Taylor. So they played up the drama. In their 1965 Movietone film Revenge for Victim of Shark Attack, a man bitten by a great white shows off his scarring – then triumphantly shoots a placid nurse shark. A roll of film ran out after about two minutes; Ron, skin-diving, needed to surface for air after one minute. “It was a slow, hard process,” says Taylor. “We’d spend all day in and out of the boat. I had the job of keeping the sharks around with bait.” Today, baiting is condemned, at least by documentary film-makers, for altering wild animals’ behaviour – though both Taylor and Doubilet say it is still common (not to mention a cornerstone of tourism operations). “You would be lucky to see a shark without bait,” says Taylor. Like Cousteau, she later condemned the bloodshed of their first films, but at the time there was no mainstream comprehension of how ecosystems operated. “If you believe the media, all sharks are killers – and in the early days, we did,” says Taylor. “There was no one else to tell us.” After the success of Revenge for Victim of Shark Attack, Ron went to South Australia looking for even more exciting sharks. It was there, in 1966, that he took the first-ever film of a great white, by dipping his camera (and his head and shoulders) into the water as the shark attacked a bait. In 1970, Gimbel hired the Taylors to make Blue Water, White Death, featuring the footage of the couple surrounded by the throng of feeding oceanic whitetip sharks. It was one of the most exciting dives of her life, says Valerie, but also one of the most reckless. She and Ron had studied accounts of ships torpedoed in the second world war, and learned that the survivors had one thing in common: they had overwhelmingly responded to a shark’s exploratory “bump” with aggression. “We knew that if they bumped us, we would bump them back harder,” says Taylor. “If you resist sharks they will not bite you,” confirms Doubilet – “but you’ve gotta pay attention.” As the pack of sharks attacked the whale carcass, the Taylors jostled for their place in the water. But visibility through all the blood was poor, and a passing shark knocked out Ron’s mouthpiece delivering compressed air. He managed to grab the cage before he lost consciousness. “That’s the closest he’d ever come to dying from a shark attack,” Valerie says. Back on the boat, reviewing the footage, they marvelled that no one had been bitten – though the Taylors had an agreement in case of a bite: keep the camera rolling. “Stay nice and still, and make him let go – and hope that somebody’s filming,” is Valerie’s advice today. (Her own most serious injury came later, from diving with more than 40 blue and mako sharks each up to 2.5 metres long. She had been luring them with mackerel towards Ron’s lens; the bite to her leg required 300 stitches and plastic surgery.) The poster for Blue Water, White Death showed Ron’s shot of the great white rearing towards the camera under the banner: MAN-EATER. “And the world said, ‘Whoa’,” says Doubilet. The film proved a formative influence on the film-maker James Cameron and the Jaws author, Peter Benchley. Mark Brownlow, executive producer at the BBC Studios’ Natural History Unit, which made Blue Planet and Blue Planet II, describes it as a seminal film for him as a young “shark nut” (though he also makes it clear he doesn’t condone the methods). The excitement of the Taylors’ dead whale sequence, says Brownlow, “wasn’t about getting a new understanding about white shark biology. It traded on the danger and excitement of divers getting close to sharks.” When Steven Spielberg asked the the couple to shoot the live-action scenes for Jaws, they asked for $2m (£1.6m), anticipating that it would take more than a year. “You can’t make a shark do what you want it to do,” says Valerie, who body doubled for Richard Dreyfuss in the film. The scene of the shark getting tangled in the cage, used in the film’s dramatic climax, was a fluke, she says. On release in 1975, the monstrous, mostly animatronic predator of Jaws nonetheless inspired enduring fear and fascination for the real animals. In the 1980s, as scuba diving and underwater photography became more accessible – not least with the advent of digital cameras – the diver Stuart Cove had the idea to put a price on an encounter. Growing up in the Bahamas, Cove was a lifelong scuba fanatic and spearfisher – but he had been terrified of sharks until he was hired to wrangle them for the 1981 Bond film For Your Eyes Only. This involved catching sharks on baited longlines, transporting them by boat to the shooting location, releasing them “strategically”, says Cove – then catching them for the next take. “Half a dozen shark catchers would be ready to jump on [a shark’s] back and slow it down for it to be recaptured. We would do that several times a day.” Crew who worked with sharks were paid an extra $150 per day. The promise of “money and fame” inspired Cove to focus his Nassau dive business on sharks. Now his eponymous operation takes in celebrities’ diver certification, personal submersibles, spectator shark feeding and film production, from documentaries to B-movies. “When I first started diving with sharks, I got so much flak,” says Cove. “Now everybody’s feeding them, all over the world.” The contribution of shark tourism to the Bahamas’ economy, an estimated $800m over the past 20 years, was instrumental to the prohibition, in 2011, of commercial fishing of more than 40 shark species in Bahamian waters. Now shark tourism is booming globally. The potential harms (for example, of sharks coming to associate people with food) are outweighed by the benefits, Doubilet believes – not least by allowing people to connect with a predator: “Tourism dollars save species.” Sharks’ negative image has been shown to be a factor in their being overlooked, historically, in conservation efforts. Cove notes the paradox of his operation: “We are very conservation-oriented, yet for the Hollywood business, we make them look scary as hell … People don’t want to see nice sharks, they want to see blood and gore.” Indeed, in testing their early prototypes for a chainmail suit to allow more hands-on footage (a type of equipment still in use today, including by Cove and the BBC), the Taylors found the sharks so reluctant to attack that Valerie had to force her arm into their mouths. It reflects a paradox of filming sharks: making an animal that is not inclined to bite people look like it is hell-bent on doing so. In 2009, the skateboarder Rob Dyrdek requested that Cove facilitate a “shark attack” to film for his reality show. Even wearing chainmail and baited, it was “hard as hell to get the shark to bite”, says Cove, though “everything worked out great” eventually. Of more than 1,000 shark species, Taylor says, “only about seven are potentially dangerous. The rest are all sweethearts.” Divers were among the first to recognise sharks’ generally shy nature, and their importance to ocean ecosystems. Even through the 1960s, the Taylors noticed coral reefs degrading, mostly through overfishing. In 1972, they made their first film with an overt conservation angle, on plummeting populations of grey nurse sharks, only six years after killing one on camera. But sharks were so little studied at the time that even their early work, shot exclusively for entertainment, informed scientific understanding. In a similar way, a 2014 study of sharks in the Aegean  gleaned new insights from Hass’s 1942 expedition that led to his 1947 film. More recently, the success of Blue Planet II in 2017 – enabled by new technology such as “rebreathers” that allowed dives to last up to three hours – proved that audiences now want to understand sharks in their complexity, says Brownlow. Twelve scientific papers were published as a result of the series. Social media, too, has helped to redeem sharks’ public image. The environmentalist and model Ocean Ramsey has amassed 1.1 million followers on Instagram for her photos of herself free-diving with great whites, while photographers Thomas Peschak and Paul Hilton highlight the shark-finning trade – showing where the threat in human-shark conflict really lies. Taylor, Doubilet and Brownlow all agree that the biggest change they have observed in a combined century of filming sharks, is the depletion in their populations. In three years of exploring Indonesian reefs, Doubilet saw only three sharks. “It’s not ‘shark bites man’, it’s ‘man bites shark’,” he says. Blue sharks in the northern Atlantic endure ceaseless, industrial-level slaughter; the fact they still exist there is testament to how much we still don’t know about the ocean, he says. The majority of the world’s oceans, after all, are without light – meaning that the next frontier of underwater photography is how to capture images through ultrasound or sonar, says Doubilet. The thought of what might be found in those “dark zones” will, undoubtedly, be an incentive for the next generation of shark cinematographers to achieve it – whatever the danger. Cousteau once told a story about working with Luis Marden, a pioneering National Geographic photographer, in the Red Sea in the mid-1950s. When the water around the boat suddenly erupted with dozens of frenzied, feeding sharks, Cousteau recalled, he had to physically restrain Marden to stop him from jumping in with his camera. Cousteau said he wasn’t sure what chilled him most: the sharks’ fury, or the photographer shrieking: “The picture of my life!” Share your thoughts and experiences using the hashtag #sharklife on Twitter and Instagram, and follow our shark series at Guardian Seascape: the state of our oceans"
"Hundreds of fishermen stood chest deep in the brisk Alaskan river. Each held a five-foot net attached to a long metal pole. The only sounds were the quacks of seabirds and occasionally a new angler plodding into the water and asking, “have you caught anything yet?” Down the beach, someone shouted, “They’re running!” As she and others began dragging their poles through the current they felt the familiar thumping of a sockeye salmon bouncing around in their nets. In Alaska, out-of-staters often pay $200 to $500 for an afternoon of guided fishing. But, if you’ve lived in the state for a full calendar year, you gain a rare privilege, one that is proving all the more essential as the pandemic causes a spike in unemployment and hunger. For a few weeks in July and August, all resident Alaskans are permitted to catch multiple coolers-full of sockeye for free. All they need is a net. Amid a festival atmosphere, Alaskans by their thousands wade with their dip nets into the mouth of the Kenai River, a few hours’ drive from Anchorage, known for its prolific quantity of sockeye, and into its twin, the Kasilof River, just down the road. They’re allowed to take home 25 sockeyes for the head of household, plus 10 more for each additional family member. A family of four, for instance, may collect a total of 55. (The rest of the salmon season, where only rod and reel fishing is allowed, anglers are limited to just six salmon a day.)  “The fish are owned by all Alaskans equally,” said Rick Green, the special assistant to the commissioner of the Alaska department of fish and game. “It’s a really cool, unique benefit that Alaskan residents get. It’s a way to use the resource owned by the people for the benefit of the people.” While Alaska has a long history of subsistence living, this year, the pandemic’s impacts on the state’s large tourism and oil industries mean it feels more important than ever to stockpile the single largest shared natural resource in the state. It’s too early to say how many salmon were harvested this season, though with more than 26,000 Alaskans households applying for dip-netting permits this year, it is probably around a half million. “It’s hugely important for Alaskans,” said Green. “You’re talking $8 or more per pound of protein, and all these people are getting that just by sticking a net in the water. The freezer of meat they’ll have is worth thousands of dollars.” Buying the same amount of salmon in a store would be prohibitively expensive for many of those taking to the Kenai. If an angler is lucky, they might be able to catch several dozen fish in a single day. One fisherman, Jeff Todisco, caught 21 salmon on his first day dip-netting on the Kenai. “It’s insurance for the winter, making sure we can provide for our families,” said Todisco, who works in the airline industry and has a young daughter. The practice is often referred to as “going to fish camp” because many people go for multiple days, spending the time between tides camping on the rocky beach. No matter the year, the encampment is vast and eclectic, not unlike a music festival. On the dunes, just out of reach of high tide, colorful tents are pitched, lawn chairs surround fire pits, there are stacks of gear and coolers, and wet waders hang to dry. Because of the coronavirus, the city of Kenai has erected hand-washing and sanitizing stations. It is strikingly egalitarian, because the only barrier to entry is obtaining a free license, which is easy enough, and owning or borrowing a dip net. Strolling among the tents, you can hear English, Russian, Arabic, Tagalog, Serbian, Samoan, Mandarin and myriad other languages being spoken. (This makes sense considering Anchorage, the state’s most populous city, is often ranked as one of the most diverse school districts in the nation) The salmon swim upriver to spawn. While people prophesy about when it’s best to fish (on the incoming tide, just after high tide, during the slack tide), various factors determine when the fish come in the thickest, ranging from how far along the season is to how many commercial fishing boats are out. Often, it’s just luck. One bluebird morning at the end of July, the fish started churning upriver in large numbers and the excitement was palpable. Children too small to hold a long net stood sentry on the shoreline, grasping small wooden mallets. When the salmon were ferried to shore, they ran up and offered to stun the animal with a quick blow to forehead. Several times, they join an excited hooting when fishers found multiple fish in their nets at once – the true sign of a bountiful tide. Some were plunked into a cooler to be tended to after the run. Bigger groups set to work cleaning and filleting the fish immediately, running a knife along the belly from tail to head, pulling out the innards, and then pressing the blade along the bones to free the ruby red flesh. Overachievers went as far as smoking or vacuum-sealing theirs on the beach. “Having salmon definitely makes a big difference for my family,” said Isaac Iaea, who has participated for the last eight years. He has six children and often sends smoked salmon to his parents in Hawaii. His eight-person household is allowed 95 fish. “I’m very grateful for this,” Iaea said of his bounty. “It’s amazing that we’re able to do this. It means a lot.”"
"More than 10 times as much plastic has been found in the Atlantic ocean than previously estimated to be there, showing the the world’s plastic problem is likely to be much greater than realised. New measurements of the top 200m of the Atlantic found between 12 and 21 million tonnes of microscopic particles of three of the most common types of plastic, in about 5% of the ocean. That would indicate a concentration in the Atlantic of about 200 million tonnes of these common plastics. Previous estimates, based on calculations of the amount of mismanaged municipal waste in coastal areas, were that between 17 million and 47 million tonnes of plastic had been released into the Atlantic in total over the 65 years from 1950 to 2015. Katsiaryna Pabortsava, of the UK’s National Oceanography Centre, and lead author of the study, said: “Our key finding is that there is an awful lot of very, very small microplastic particles in the upper Atlantic ocean, much higher than the previous estimate. The amount of plastic has been massively underestimated.” She said the discovery should spur policymakers to consider what could be done to stop so much plastic reaching the seas, where it endangered marine life. She added that people still knew too little about the dangers. “Society is very concerned about plastic, for ocean health and human health,” Pabortsava said. “We need to answer fundamental questions about the effects of this plastic, and if it harms ocean health. The effects might be serious, but might take a while to kick in at sub-lethal levels.” In order for policymakers to stop plastic reaching the oceans – where it stays for decades, breaking up into smaller and smaller particles – they need better understanding of the sources, and how it behaves once in the water. “The sources of plastic in the ocean have not been quantified properly,” said Pabortsava. “We really don’t know enough about how much plastic is going into the ocean, and where from.” The findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, followed other research that showed the scourge of plastic in the oceans was likely to be greater and growing faster than had been recognised. Research published in April showed that microplastics were found in greater quantities than ever before on the seabed, in areas suggesting they had been carried to the bottom by strong currents and concentrated in hotspots. A further study in May concluded that the amount of microplastic in the ocean had been underestimated, and that the particles could outnumber zooplankton. Last month, a major study by the Pew Trusts and others found that the amount of plastic entering the oceans was likely to triple in the next 20 years, on current trends. Jim Palardy, director of conservation science at the Pew Trusts, who was not involved in this week’s Nature paper, said: “[This] study not only shows that we have a lot to learn about the scale of ocean plastic pollution, but also highlights the need for immediate and sustained action to tackle this urgent issue. Although it may be daunting, ocean plastic pollution is not an insurmountable problem.” Action was urgently needed, he said: “Our recent study found that existing technologies can greatly reduce the amount of ocean plastic – if we make immediate changes.” Scientists are poised to learn more about the potential harms to health from microplastic pollution. Earlier this week, researchers reported on a new technique that would allow them to detect the presence of microplastics in human organs. For the latest paper, scientists from the UK’s National Oceanography Centre collected seawater samples at 12 locations along a route across the Atlantic, from Britain to the Falklands, between September and November 2016. They took large volumes of seawater from three depths in the top 200 metres of the ocean, then filtered it and used spectroscopic imaging to detect microparticles of polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene, three of the most commonly used plastics, reckoned to make up more than half of global plastic waste. They found up to 7,000 microparticles of these three plastic types per cubic metre of seawater in the samples. While the findings apply only to the Atlantic, and cannot be extrapolated to the Pacific or other areas, they indicate that our knowledge of the true extent of the plastic problem is incomplete. “Other oceans are also severely under-sampled,” Pabortsava said."
"The UK is to get its first commercial refinery for extracting precious metals from electronic waste, which will also be the world’s first to use bacteria rather than cyanide-based processes. A New Zealand startup, Mint Innovation, plans to open the facility within 12 months in Cheshire, in the north of England, after delays caused by the Covid-19 crisis. The UK’s impending exit from the EU has provided an urgent economic need for such a facility – a UN report last month found at least $10bn (£7.9bn) of gold, platinum and other precious metals were dumped every year in a growing mountain of e-waste. When the Commons environmental audit committee launched its inquiry into e-waste and the circular economy last year, its then chair, Mary Creagh, criticised the UK’s “unsustainable” approach to e-waste and called for radical action. The UK produced more e-waste than the EU average and was “one of the worst offenders for exporting e-waste to developing countries ill-equipped to dispose of it in a socially and environmentally responsible way”, she said. Recyclers in the UK have to send printed circuit boards to mainland Europe to have the precious metals they contain extracted. After Brexit, the costs of doing this are expected to rise. Rhys Charles, a researcher at Swansea University’s College of Engineering, said: “If we have to pay import and export duties to access processes it could be detrimental to recycling at a time when it is becoming more strategically important to build our own circular economy.” Mint was set up in 2016 to develop a bio-refinery that combines hydrometallurgy and biotechnology to safely extract metals – including gold, palladium, silver and copper – from e-waste. Ollie Crush, the company’s chief scientific officer, says the key features of its refineries are that they are low-cost, green, and local to where the waste is being created. “The plants are very agricultural, more like a small microbrewery. The regulatory tailwind is for western nations to handle their own waste stream. We offer the same yield as the big smelters, the same level of service and quicker,” he said. “But unlike the smelters, we do not use cyanide and we use less energy, less CO2, less water, less waste. A refinery can be popped into any nation, region or city.’ The Cheshire refinery – Mint has not revealed the plant’s exact location in the county – will initially be able to process 20 tonnes of e-waste per day and, if the demand is there, this can be scaled up. Another plant in the south of England is being considered and a refinery is planned for Sydney, Australia. Jason Love, a professor of molecular inorganic chemistry at Edinburgh University, says technical challenges need to be addressed if the mining of precious metals from electronic waste is to be truly sustainable and environmentally neutral. He said: “What Mint is doing seems very nice but I don’t think it is groundbreaking. The real sticking point is how do you dissolve the metals. The company’s selling point is its use of microbes but that is only one aspect of its process. It is using acids too.” Mint says it does not use cyanide but “common weak acids and a bit of tricky chemistry”. According to Crush: “From the start, it has been our intention to recycle as much of the chemicals we use as possible.” Charles says if Mint can deliver it will be a game-changer. “Localised, smaller scale recovery benefits local people, they see the value of it to their community and town and so are more likely to buy into it. This is how you start to build truly sustainable economic development.”"
"District councils in England are urging people going to parks and green spaces to dispose of their rubbish safely and responsibly, ahead of an expected surge in visits during this weekend’s mini-heatwave. The District Councils’ Network – which represents 187 district councils in England, which are responsible for maintaining parks and beauty spots – is calling on the public to use bins but to take their rubbish home if they are full. It is also asking dog walkers to make sure they clean up their pets’ mess. During the coronavirus pandemic, councils have stepped up efforts to maintain parks and beauty spots after a sharp rise in littering, dog fouling and anti-social behaviour such as vandalism. Since 4 July, when lockdown was eased, the volume of additional rubbish, including single-use plastic discarded in English parks by the public, has increased, park managers have reported. The partial lifting of lockdown led to millions more people using the green spaces to meet, exercise, eat and drink. A recent survey by Keep Britain Tidy found that more than half of the country’s parks have had to use extra resources to deal with the issues, including litter and antisocial behaviour, since lockdown was eased. Of those, 81% had to spend more on clearing up litter, 79% on bin emptying and 72% on maintaining public order or enforcing lockdown rules. “It is great that more people have been able to enjoy safely spending time in our parks, green spaces and beauty spots, while much of life has been on hold these last few months” said Dan Humphreys, the District Councils’ Network lead member for enhancing quality of life. “However, sadly this appears to have come at a cost, with some councils seeing a sharp spike in littering, dog fouling and antisocial behaviour from a small minority of people who sadly ruin it for everyone.” Among the councils devising new ways to tackle the problem, Rushmoor borough council has joined forces with Hampshire constabulary to encourage residents to use green spaces safely and responsibly, and has launched an app for visitors to report litter “grotspots”. The litter strewn in parks and on beaches also includes abandoned items of PPE such as face masks and gloves, which contain plastic."
"The Big Butterfly Count this year took place between 17 July and 9 August. People in Britain were asked to spend 15 minutes in a park, garden, field or wood, counting the butterflies they see. From peacocks to jersey tigers, here are some of the photos readers sent in of the butterflies and moths they spotted during the count. “When I saw this butterfly in front of a pretty background I just had to take a picture of it. It let me come really close so I could observe it in detail,” said 11-year-old Astrid Stone of this photograph she took in her back garden in Tunbridge Wells. “I love butterflies because of their amazing wings and fragile shape, the wonderful patterns and pretty colours. I enjoy looking for butterflies and identifying them which is why I did the butterfly count,” she said. “When I am older I hope to become a butterfly specialist.” This is the second time that 34-year-old Rusana Krasteva, who works for a travel agency, has taken part in the count. She said that the pandemic adds extra poignancy to this year’s event. “Due to the lockdown and pandemic restrictions we all started noticing the little things that surround us which we normally miss in our daily life,” she said. “Especially people like me stuck in the big busy city of London, rushing to the office five or six days a week, compared to me currently working from home and, on days like today, even from my patio garden.” “I saw it [a jersey tiger moth] on the ground and thought the cat who often visits had got it but it was very much alive in all of its glorious beauty,” said Charlotte Hopkins, 42, who works as an information officer at London Metropolitan Archives. “It was absolutely stunning, its colourful coat looked just like a tiger,” she added. “I had never seen one before – it made my day.” Hopkins also took part in the count last year, both times in her garden in Camberwell, London. “This year I’ve seen a greater variety of different species: peacocks, speckled woods, small tortoiseshells and painted ladies. But I’m yet to see the famous Camberwell beauty.” Alison Offer in Charlbury, Oxfordshire has said she sometime finds herself “walking through a cloud of butterflies”. “They must have always been there, but it’s taken till lockdown for me to notice them,” she said. She knew about the count last year but wasn’t able to take part due to her daily commute. “This year though the world has shrunk,” said Charlbury. “Instead of sitting in a car for an hour, I’ve spent that time wandering our local green lanes and footpaths. I’ve become much more aware of butterflies now. “I have not seen the usual number of tortoiseshells and red admirals in our garden, but the lanes and flower meadows of west Oxfordshire are alive with butterflies – marbled whites, meadow browns, gatekeeper butterflies and others.” Nine-year-old Ralf spotted the mountain ringlet when with his dad Steve Banks in Rampsgill Head above Haweswater, in the Lake District. “Ralf chased it around so he could track where it perched; I was then able to get a picture of it on my phone,” Banks said. “They are only found between 500m and 800m in the Lakes and a few locations in the Highlands. They are scarce and live on matt grass, and are usually only spotted on sunny days. It’s only the second one we’ve seen.” Banks said his interest in butterflies had been piqued during lockdown while on walks with Ralf in their home of Threlkeld, near Keswick. “I’ve never been involved in the butterfly count before but became interested in butterflies, moths, trees and wild flowers in more detail this year when using the lockdown to go out on nature walks with Ralf,” he said. “He’s become adept at identifying butterflies and has spotted 15 different species so far.” In Edinburgh, five-year-old Freya spotted this tortoiseshell butterfly, which was captured by her dad Stuart, 39, on one of the family’s daily walks during lockdown. “I love butterflies because they are so pretty and colourful,” said Freya. “Sometimes if you stand still they’ll land on your nose.” “My counts have taken place exclusively in my garden and mostly around a buddleia bush and some marjoram,” said John Showers, 72, who captured this photograph of a peacock butterfly in his garden in Northants. He said there had been up to nine peacock butterflies at any one time. This is the second year that Showers has participated in the event, and said he had seen fewer butterflies during this year’s count. “It’s not been as productive as last year, largely, I think, because of more variable weather this year,” he said. “Here we have had a lot of cloudy and breezy days which tend to depress the count.” “At present I cannot walk very far because of a foot injury so being able to do the count in my garden has given me my daily wildlife fix,” he added. “We spotted this beautiful red admiral walking past our neighbour’s front garden. I expect it was trying to dry its wings in peace,” said Katie Lingwood, 40, an architect who lives in St Albans. “My son stuck his finger out and it climbed right on.” “We did the butterfly count last year and only saw cabbage whites and orange tipped butterflies, and only a few at that,” she said. “This year has been amazing. We’ve seen loads of peacocks for the first time ever, blue butterflies and lots of unidentified orange and brown ones. Plus, some cool moths including finding a lime hawk moth caterpillar which is huge!” “These photos were taken in Earswick, just outside York, on 17 July at around 9.30 am,” said Amy Glasman, a 22-year-old student. “There is a buddleia plant just outside my window and there are usually multiple butterflies on it at any given time. “On this occasion, I watched as the sun hit the plant, and the butterflies, who I assume had been sleeping on it as they were completely still, woke up and began pollinating. I could see about six butterflies on the plant at once.”"
"More than 20 metres up an ironbark tree in Sydney’s Olympic Park, more than 70,000 people from around the world have been cheering on two tiny, restless and feathery fluff balls in the shape of eagle chicks. Pulling up the live EagleCAM from their phones and computer screens, thousands have been watching the comings and goings of a pair of white-bellied sea eagles turning up with morsels of fish to feed their newly hatched and very fluffy young. “There are some people watching obsessively – it’s a bit like their version of Days of Our Lives,” says Judy Harrington, the founder of the EagleCAM project. Since the cameras went up in 2009, people from 195 different countries have viewed the live feed that has been accessed 5 million times. And, in recent weeks, the drama has been intense. Just over a week ago, the first signs of life were spotted in one of the eggs and – a day and a night later – a chick had fought its way out. Two days later, the second chick had also wrenched itself from the shell. “The first one always has a bit of an advantage and it’s bigger and stronger and it can outcompete the weedy one, but that’s natural behaviour in raptors,” says Harrington, a retired ranger in the park and a volunteer for BirdLife Southern NSW. “But at the moment, the small one seems to be holding its own.” At peak viewing, more than 15,000 people are logged in to the live 24-hour EagleCAM feed. The male and female are regularly out hunting for fish in the nearby Parramatta River and returning to the two hungry young. Some years there have been no hatched eggs, other years there have been two. If all goes well, this breed of 2020 will take their first flight some time in November. “Once the cute babies are on the nest people are watching avidly,” Harrington says. “It’s a real thrill when they fly.” There are three cameras that are used to watch over the young, that can be zoomed and tilted remotely. Sea eagles breed for life but three years ago the resident female disappeared. The resident male, who has been at the same site for about a decade, has been with his new mate for the past three years. The white-bellied sea eagle is Australia’s second-largest raptor. The wingspan of the female, which is larger, is about two metres. Kerry Darcovich, senior manager of environment and ecology at Sydney Olympic Park Authority, says: “These birds are so prone to human disturbance that we do not allow anyone into the area during breeding season otherwise we would significantly reduce the success of breeding. “EagleCAM provides an opportunity to connect with nature without causing disruption. People become aware of these magnificent birds and gain an appreciation of what they are sharing their parks and neighbourhoods with.” Right now, with the the world grappling to contain a pandemic, tuning in to live nature webcams can give people’s mental health a small lift, says Simon Branigan, who manages the oceans program for the Nature Conservancy in Australia. The charity helps maintain two livestream cameras in a marine park at Port Phillip Bay, south of Melbourne, together with Deakin University. One camera above the water scans a population of Australian gannets, while an underwater camera catches the comings and goings on the rocky reef – with the occasional seal, dolphin and many fish species shooting by. “It’s important that we showcase these amazing marine environment of southern Australia,” Branigan says. He says viewing the underwater camera can be a little hit and miss, but the best times tend to be on a slack tide on a sunny quiet day. Branigan says: “I think it helps people connect with nature and it has a bit of a calming effect. This time of a pandemic is really challenging for people’s mental health so for people to be able to check out beautiful Port Phillip from their lounge room I think is really beneficial.” James Cook University, at Townsville in Queensland, also maintains a live underwater camera at Orpheus Island, paid for with the help of a grant from the Queensland Government. Prof Andrew Krockenberger, the university’s dean of research, says the camera – together with others above the water – are used as part of a program to engage school children in classrooms. “But there’s definitely a bit of therapy there,” he says. Several university staff have been grabbing loops from the live feed and using it as their background in Zoom meetings. The camera is situated in Pioneer Bay on the sheltered side of the island looking at a coral bommie and, during the day, is often teeming with reef fish. The university’s Classroom on the Reef program also provide students with data from monitoring stations, but it’s the live cameras that Krockenberger says gives teachers a chance to hook the children in. As lounge and classroom-based nature lovers are glued to reefs and sea eagles, web traffic is also starting to build at FalconCam – a project that has two cameras inside the eyrie of peregrine falcons on the Orange campus of Charles Sturt University in New South Wales. The eyrie – or nest – is built into the side of a 50-metre high water tower and has been taking video since 2007. The current occupants – female Diamond and male Xavier – have been together since about 2015. Next month, watchers will hope to see Diamond lay as many as three eggs, with chicks usually emerging in October. Even though there’s going to be activity very soon, the project’s technical manager, Scott Banks, says international traffic tends to lift at around Christmas when northern hemisphere web fans turn their attention south. Part of the appeal of peregrine falcons is their speed – they are the animal kingdom’s fastest species, regularly clocking 300 km/h (186 mph) as they dive for prey. Banks, whose day job is a website developer, says for many years one of FalconCAM’s most regular visitors was a children’s day care centre in the Canadian city of Winnipeg that would turn on the feed every morning for the children to watch. “We’ve got a remarkable diversity of viewers – some people live for this sort of thing. It’s like reality TV. It’s nature at its closest. “I think people like the idea of seeing what has been a rare species breeding and interacting and seeing their lifecycle from an egg to a fledgling going out the window. We can get up close without interfering.”"
"A decision on a controversial coal seam gas development at Narrabri, in north-west New South Wales, has been delayed after the company behind it lodged a last-minute submission suggesting it will have greater economic benefits than previously claimed. The state independent planning commission announced on Friday it would reopen public comments on the $3.6bn project, proposed by the oil and gas company Santos, and push back a decision by four weeks, until 30 September. It follows Santos lodging a submission on Monday that included new modelling suggesting gas could be produced more cheaply at the site than had been estimated, the project would reduce gas prices in the state, and the economic and employment benefits would be greater than previously thought. In hearings last month, the commission heard evidence from hundreds of people and groups, most of them opposed. Objections included that it would damage the local environment, affect biodiversity in the Pilliga forest and lead to substantial greenhouse gas emissions at odds with Australia’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement. The project would involve up to 850 coal seam gas wells being drilled on 1,000 hectares of a 95,000 hectare site that includes Pilliga forest and nearby grazing land. Santos says it could provide up to 200 terajoules of gas a day for domestic use for 20 years, equivalent to 50% of NSW demand. The project has strong government backing. It has been formally supported by the NSW Coalition, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, listed it as one of 15 projects of national significance, promising an accelerated assessment under federal environment laws. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has suggested it will help bring down gas prices. In a statement on Friday afternoon, the commission said the deadline for its decision had been extended due to the complexity of the issues under consideration and the high level of interest in the project. The chance for further scrutiny was welcomed by project opponents. Mark Ogge, a principal adviser to progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said Santos had “completely re-written” the case for the project after hearings closed, lifting the estimated number of jobs by 78% and economic output by 36%. “It smacks of desperation,” he said. Elaine Johnson, principal lawyer with the Environment Defenders Office, said Santos’ late submission was unusual and the new economic evidence was “substantially different” to what it had submitted previously. “Clearly, they have provided it in response to all the very significant concerns that were raised in the hearings,” Johnson said. “It is entirely appropriate that the community gets an opportunity to respond.” A Santos spokesman said the company was disappointed the decision had been delayed, but added: “No one can now say they have not had ample opportunity to have their say on the project.” Santos’s updated assertion, based on modelling by consultants ACIL Allen, that the project would reduce gas prices for consumers and businesses appears at odds with evidence to the commission by David Kitto, the director of the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and the Environment. Kitto told the hearings the project was relatively small and the department had not claimed it would reduce gas prices. He later said Narrabri was consistent with state government policy to put downward pressure on prices by increasing gas supply. Santos chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, has consistently said the project would reduce gas prices, but this assumption was not included in the company’s previous modelling. A Santos spokesman said its reduced estimate of the cost of Narrabri gas was based on a recent analysis by the Australian Energy Market Operator. He said the reduced capital cost followed a decline in costs at its Queensland operations. “We will bring that experience to Narrabri,” he said. Opposition to the project has come from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which found gas from Narrabri would on average cost more than from other fields, a claim rejected by the company. Former chief scientist Penny Sackett called for the plan to be rejected as it was at odds with the Paris agreement and a state target of cutting emissions to net zero by 2050. Gas is often described as having half the emissions of coal, but recent studies have suggested it could be more. In January, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said Narrabri was one of “two or three options” to deliver 70 petajoules of additional gas a year promised under a $2bn energy agreement with the federal government. Others were a gas import terminal at Port Kembla and a second possible terminal at Newcastle."
"Communities of color in the US must make do with smaller, more overcrowded public parks compared with white Americans, as the country struggles to cope with record-breaking heatwaves and Covid-19 restrictions on swimming pools, beaches and communal cooling centres. Public parks in majority black and brown neighborhoods are half the size and almost five times as crowded, according to new research by the Trust for Public Land. Spending time in green spaces reduces stress and improves physical and psychological wellbeing for adults and children, but shady spots can also protect people from deadly extreme heat. In addition, the study of 14,000 towns and cities around America found that parks serving majority low-income households are on average four times smaller and four times more crowded than parks that serve mostly high-income households. The findings support a mounting body of evidence linking environmental injustice to longstanding racial and income inequalities that are being further exacerbated by the climate crisis. Extreme heat is among the deadliest weather hazards humanity faces due to the climate crisis, which contributes to more than 5,000 prematures deaths in the US every year. Counties with large black and brown populations already endure significantly more dangerously hot days than white communities, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. This year is on track to be at least the second hottest on record, but access to cool places which mitigate the impact of extreme heat such as beaches, pools and malls are restricted in many parts of the country due to the pandemic. The Covid-19 crisis has shone a light on years of patchy investment which has left 100 million Americans – including 27 million children – without access to a park close to home. The study found that neighborhoods within a 10-minute walk of a park are up to 6F cooler than those further away. “As cities struggle with extreme heat this summer, parks are one of the best ways for residents to find relief,” said Diane Regas, CEO and president of The Trust for Public Land, a national organization that has built thousands of parks and protected millions of acres of land. “We all need and deserve parks – and all of the benefits they provide – all of the time. But during this period of compounded public health emergencies, unequal access to quality parks can be downright dangerous,” Regas added. Heatwaves have been occurring more frequently since the mid-20th century, and there’s mounting consensus among climate scientists that dangerous bouts of high temperatures and humidity will become substantially more common, more severe, and longer-lasting without adequate action to curb global heating. Surfaces in shade can be up to 45F cooler than those in the sun – and trees can also lower indoor temperatures, especially when shade covers parts of rooftops and windows. In 2018, a landmark citizen-science project found large parks in Washington and Baltimore – especially those with dense trees and dark green vegetation – were up to 17F cooler than neighborhoods dominated by densely packed buildings and concrete which trap heat to create urban heat islands."
"A raging fire described as “completely out of control” is threatening one of South America’s major wetland ecosystems. The fire has been burning for months now, and is visible from the balconies of luxury apartments along the shoreline of the Paraná River in Argentina’s central city of Rosario Locals have been sharing photos and videos of the fires on social media. In normal times, Rosario’s riverfront homes enjoy a spectacular view of the seemingly never-ending green grasslands on the opposite bank of the Paraná, a waterway stretching over a mile across as it passes through the city.   In recent months, however, dwellers in the luxury condos have been congregating on their balconies as the wall of red flames from thousands of fires raging through the Paraná delta grasslands rises high into the sky. “Everything is burning, it’s completely out of control,” Leonel Mingo, a spokesperson for Greenpeace Argentina, told the Guardian. “Once a fire reaches that scale, it becomes virtually impossible to stop.” The Paraná is South America’s second largest river after the Amazon and the eighth longest river in the world. Its floodplain, known by Rosarinos as “la isla”, is not actually an island, but a vast delta covering some 15,000km2 , through which the Paraná drains towards the Atlantic Ocean 300km away.The giant delta is clearly visible in satellite imagery as a dark green wedge on the northern margin of the Paraná from Rosario to Buenos Aires.Giant plumes of smoke from the fires raging since February have at times covered the streets of Rosario and other places along the Paraná with a layer of ash from scorched plants and animals. The air in Rosario has been unbreathable for weeks at a time. Jorge Liotta, a biologist specialising in the abundant wildlife of the delta, lives with his wife and two young children in the nearby riverside city of San Nicolás de los Arroyos. Their home is just a block from the Paraná’s shoreline.“The other night I walked to the river and could see seven fires burning in the distance,” Liotta told the Guardian. “It depends on the wind if the smoke hits you, but when it does, the smoke is so thick that the sun turns red and you can barely see the house next door. What’s worse, it gets inside your home. People with asthma and other breathing difficulties are really suffering.”Far from abating, the number of fires has been rising. Liotta works at the Scasso Natural Science Museum in San Nicolás, where he has been monitoring the delta fires via Nasa satellites. “We’ve identified 8,024 likely fires so far this year, almost half of them this month of July.” Liotta worked backwards and found the scale of thecalamity was unprecedented. “The average number of yearly satellite-detected hotspots was only 1,800 in 2012–2019. We’re already at over 8,000 and barely halfway through the year.”Although cattle ranchers, illegal hunters and property developers have encroached on its rich habitat, the Paraná delta still teems with diverse wildlife, all facing a dire challenge to their survival.Liotta says it breaks his heart to imagine the scale of destruction. “I can’t help thinking about the animals when I see the fires. If we humans are suffering so much, can you imagine what it must be like for the creatures being burned alive?” He recites a list of the delta’s species: “There’s the carpincho [capybara], the world’s largest rodent, a relative to the guinea pig, but the size of a farm pig, weighing over 60 kilos, aquatic and highly gregarious. Then the gato montés [wildcat], a solitary hunter at the top of the delta food chain despite being only the size of a domestic cat, either spotted like a leopard or entirely black like a panther. Then there’s an endless variety of birds, invertebrates, mollusks, rare insects, amphibians, reptiles … which must be suffering an incredible mortality rate.” The coronavirus pandemic has added to the problems, making it impossible for experts to travel to the affected areas. But it has not thwarted cattle ranchers, driven from more productive lands by the growth of soya bean plantations, from sending their cattle to graze on the constantly shifting delta islands.With hardly any roads or infrastructure, the delta remains a daunting challenge for those without expert knowledge of the region. “You have to get around on horseback or by boat”, says Liotta. “Cattle ranchers ship their livestock to the islands on barcos jaula [cage boats], sometimes two storeys high, that carry around 60 heads of cattle each.”  The unregulated expansion of cattle ranching is the main culprit for the expanding fires says Laura Prol, an ecologist from the Rosario-based environmental NGO Taller Ecologista.“The delta has always been used by livestock farmers to graze their cattle, but the number of cattle grew 500% between between 2000 and 2010,” Prol told the Guardian. “Although that number has dropped some in the last decade, ranchers continue burning the dead winter grass as if they were still in the 19th century, the idea being for the new grass beneath to sprout stronger.”Prol points to illegal carpincho hunters lighting fires to corral their prey and tourists from Rosario who cross the river to hold barbecues and kayak in the delta as other likely culprits.“But the real problem is that 2020 has been one of the driest of recent years, which causes two problems. First, without proper humidity the dead grass becomes highly flammable, and second, the low level of the river dries out the canals that usually act as buffers that stop the fire from expanding beyond individual islands,” says Prol.The environmentalist is also frustrated by the coronavirus pandemic making it almost impossible to see the terrain first hand. “We can’t go, but cattle ranchers, tourists and illegal hunters are still getting there.”The shocking photos posted on social media, and the sheer extent and duration of the fires, have prodded the authorities into action.Environment minister Juan Cabandié has opened legal action against alleged culprits, tweeting geolocation maps pinpointing the fires and demanding local judges identify and arrest the landowners. “They must tell us who owns these lands, arrest them and put those responsible on trial.” The city of Rosario has also demanded legal action and sent firefighting helicopters to the area.But environmentalists say more is needed. “Legal action won’t stop the fires. What is needed is a long-term environmental policy to deal with the drop in the level of the river caused by the changing climate and by the El Niño weather phenomenon,” says Prol. “This year’s dry spell might also be an effect of the fires in the Amazon last year, in which a large amount of vapour-producing vegetation that then turned to rain perished. Finding the culprits for this year’s fires is of course important, but we need real environmental protection.” Mingo of Greenpeace agrees. “We have been lobbying for years for a comprehensive wetlands law. The reason these fires are raging is because there is no legislation. We need to ban cattle farming in the delta. Because right now, with this dry weather, with the drying up of the Paraná river and without a campaign to change the traditional use of fire by cattle ranchers to clear land for pasture, you have the perfect storm.” Send us your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com"
"Analysts at global banking giant HSBC have sounded the alarm over the potential risks of investing in JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, after a string of investigations raising concerns about Amazon deforestation issues in its beef supply chain. The meat giant “has no vision, action plan, timeline, technology or solution” for monitoring whether the cattle it buys originate from farms involved in rainforest destruction, according to analysis by the bank, which has substantial investments in the troubled meat packing firm. In a recent financial report on JBS – obtained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism – HSBC analysts said they had asked the company “multiple times” about its plan to address deforestation but appeared to be unsatisfied, leading them to conclude that “the pressure is on JBS”. The analysts expressed disquiet that in their view the company had allowed a smaller competitor to take on the mantle of addressing forest destruction, after Marfrig – another Brazilian beef exporter – committed to full traceability of its Amazon cattle by 2025. “We have never seen a major industry leader default an industry matter this serious to a smaller participant,” the report said. “It is the major risk on JBS that worries us because it speaks to seriousness of purpose on ESG [environmental and social governance] matters for a company that in our view, has something to prove.” It adds: “There is a valuation benefit that goes with being the largest solution provider to deforestation in Brazil and unfortunately, we don’t see JBS inclined to lead and own that title.” JBS, which has annual revenues of $50bn (£38bn) and slaughters almost 35,000 cattle a day in Brazil, is coming under increasing pressure from investors over its environmental record. The investment arm of northern Europe’s largest financial services group last month dropped the company from its portfolio. JBS is now excluded from assets sold by Nordea Asset Management, which controls a €230bn (£210bn) fund. The HSBC report cites a recent investigation by the Bureau, the Guardian and Repórter Brasil revealing that JBS’s trucks had moved cattle from a ranch marked by government data as being under sanction due to illegal deforestation to a “clean” farm, which in turn sold cattle onto JBS abattoirs. JBS disputed the findings, but did not give a clear explanation of exactly where their trucks had been collecting cattle from. The investigation prompted calls for supermarkets and fast food chains to immediately cease trading with JBS. HSBC analysts discussed JBS’s recent attempt to split the Brazilian part of its business from its global operations, in order to float the international arm on the New York Stock Exchange with no Amazon risk for investors. The report also refers to other historical issues. “After its legacy of governance and corruption problems, JBS’s board and senior leadership are in need of proof points that the firm has indeed turned over a new leaf on ESG responsibility matters.” Despite expressing concerns, the HSBC report does still recommend buying JBS stock. “We like JBS for its debt reduction story, diverse portfolio of proteins, geographic footprint, leadership in the industry and scale. Its proposed [New York] listing would likely improve governance if done correctly, reduce cost of capital and strategically position the company for new growth opportunities.” HSBC holds JBS shares and bonds worth some $9 million, according to recent research by the NGO Feedback. HSBC told the Bureau that those holdings were usually held on behalf of other parties and that in such cases the bank had no part in the decision to invest in specific companies. The bank’s report comes amid global outrage over the fate of the world’s biggest rainforest. The Amazon is a crucial buffer in stabilising the regional and global climate. Experts say its preservation is essential to tackling the climate emergency. Last year, a study by supply-chain initiative Trase concluded that JBS’s global beef exports were linked to up to 300 sq km of deforestation per year in Brazil. JBS told the Bureau and the Guardian: “As we are due to report results to our investors and stakeholders later this week, we believe it is good practice to avoid further comments at this time.

"The first beavers to live wild in England for centuries are to be allowed to remain in their new home on the River Otter in east Devon after a five-year reintroduction trial. The government gave permission on Thursday for the reestablished colony to remain in the area, the first wild breeding of beavers in 400 years and the first legally sanctioned reintroduction of an extinct native mammal to England. Up to 15 family groups of beavers are now estimated to live on the Otter, after seven years in which their future success did not always look assured. Peter Burgess, director of conservation at Devon Wildlife Trust, which has overseen the reintroduction trial, told the Guardian: “There have been some sleepless nights, and it was very stressful in the early stages. We knew the benefits, but things were hanging on a knife edge over securing the licence at the beginning.” The beavers started out as interlopers, when a family group were found to be living on the River Otter in 2013, their origins unknown. They were threatened with removal, but the Devon Wildlife Trust and community groups stepped in and tried to show the beavers were European, rather than north American, and eventually gained a licence for a five-year trial, which was extended in February to conclude this month. Beavers alter the landscape and ecosystems in and around waterways, with their dam-building helping to reduce pollution and boosting local wildlife populations, including fish and amphibians, according to a study from Exeter University. As the UK’s climate changes under global heating, droughts and devastating floods are likely to become more common, and beavers can help with both: their damming slows the speed of floods downhill when there is too much rainfall, and helps provide water storage that stops rivers running dry during droughts. The dams also filter out pollutants and stop topsoil being washed away. Key to the success of the River Otter project was getting local people and farmers involved and explaining the benefits beavers can bring, as well as providing support when needed, said Burgess. There were several incidents of localised flooding of farmland, when the landowners were concerned, but by providing expert support the reintroduction team were able to resolve the problems. “If landowners know there’s someone they can pick up the phone to, it really helps,” Burgess said. “Animals are much more likely to be welcomed if that is the approach.” Beavers can grow to 20kg, but contrary to popular misconceptions, live on an exclusively vegetarian diet and do not eat fish. Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “It’s great to see that the reintroduction of beavers in this trial has resulted in a win-win for the local area, boosting wildlife and tackling man-made problems. The trial clearly proves the benefits of nature-based solutions to dealing with flooding, water quality and resilience to climate change. “We hope to see more such welcome projects introduced by government as part of flooding, water and climate planning.” However, Phil Jarvis, chair of the environment forum at the National Farmers’ Union, warned that farmers would want to see an “exit strategy”, as well as adequate funding and a long-term management plan, before any expansion. “Beavers can have a significant local impact on the countryside and farming; from creating dams that can undermine riverbanks, to impeding farmland drainage with waterlogged fields becoming unsuitable for grazing and cropping; all lead to serious implications on our ability to produce food,” he said. “We must see a well-thought through exit strategy if any major issues occur.” The government said on Thursday it would consult later this year on the possibility of further reintroductions, and a national approach to the issue. An increasing number of farmers and conservationists are considering rewilding schemes for their land, and there are calls for reintroductions of animals from boar to lynx and wolves. A survey of members and supporters of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust on lynx reintroduction received 4,500 replies, of which 68% were in favour. No more releases in the wild will be allowed until the consultation is complete. Rebecca Pow, environment minister, said: “We are firmly committed to providing opportunities to reintroduce formerly native species, such as beavers, where the benefits for the environment, people and the economy are clear. “But we also understand that there are implications for landowners, and take care to ensure that all potential impacts are carefully considered.”"
"Bunnings will stop selling timber logged by VicForests after a court found the state government-owned forestry agency breached conservation laws. “Bunnings has a zero-tolerance approach to illegally logged timber that dates back two decades and our commitment is to only source timber products from legal and well managed forest operations,” Bunnings’ director of merchandise, Phil Bishop, said on Wednesday. Bishop said in light of the recent federal court finding that VicForests breached the code of practice in its regional forestry agreement for the central highlands, Bunnings could no longer stock products that used its timber. The decision comes as the Nature Conservation Council of NSW prepares to launch a campaign calling on the chain to stop selling timber sourced from native forests in New South Wales. VicForests said it was deeply concerned by Bunnings’ decision and it would be appealing against the federal court judgment once final orders were made in the case. The court found in May that because VicForests had breached the code of practice, its exemption from national environment laws did not apply. The court ruled the agency had breached laws protecting threatened species including the greater glider and the Leadbeater’s possum. “We will be discontinuing all sourcing of timber from VicForests and will no longer be accepting raw material input into our supply chain from VicForests as of 30 June,” Bishop said. “Ultimately, we believe that customers and team members have the right to expect that the timber they purchase is sourced from responsible and lawful forestry operations.” Bunnings said it sold only a small portion of VicForests’ harvest but it would work with affected suppliers on a transition plan. That would include buying any timber already processed by the affected suppliers and discussing whether those suppliers could obtain timber from alternative sources. A spokesman for VicForests said: “We are deeply concerned by Bunnings’ decision to no longer source native timber products from Victoria. “VicForests has already advised our customers that we will be appealing the Friends of the Leadbeater’s Possum court decision, once final orders are made by the court. “We regrow all harvested coupes with their original species, all timber harvesting and regeneration operations are conducted to conform with Victoria’s strict environmental regulations.” In NSW, the Nature Conservation Council is now calling on Bunnings to cease sourcing timber from native forests in the state. The council’s chief executive, Chris Gambian, said the chain’s decision in Victoria showed leadership from one of the country’s “largest resellers of native timber products”. He said while the specifics of the Victorian federal court case did not apply to NSW, there were ecological and moral reasons for the company to remove NSW native timber from its supply chains. “Native forest logging is destroying ecosystems and driving the koala and other species to extinction,” he said. “We have a moral responsibility to ensure the survival of this iconic species and the only way we can do that is by stopping the logging of native forests in this state.” Steve Meacher is the president of the Friends of Leadbeater’s Possum, which brought the case against VicForests. He welcomed Bunnings’ announcement. “Friends of Leadbeater’s Possum is glad to hear they will no longer be distributing unlawfully obtained products,” he said. “It will benefit our forests and wildlife and all Victorians. “It means people will be able to buy their timber from Bunnings with confidence.” Both parties have made submissions regarding final orders in the case and a short hearing is set for next week. The national campaigns director for the Wilderness Society, Amelia Young, said the case made clear VicForests had consistently failed to follow the law and its operations had contributed to the decline of the greater glider and Leadbeater’s possum. “VicForests’ inability to deal with rampant illegality across its logging operations has led to this clear response from one of Australia’s leading hardware stores that illegally logged wood is unacceptable,” she said. “We expect other retailers of wood and paper products sourced through VicForests’ illegal logging will follow suit.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from the Victorian resources minister, Jaclyn Symes. In response to the landmark judgment, conservationists have urged a review of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to reconsider the exemption granted to the forestry industry via regional forestry agreements. Graeme Samuel, the former competition watchdog chair who is leading the review, has handed his interim report to the environment minister, Sussan Ley. The report is due for release soon."
"The Greens swept to their best-ever results in the 2019 European elections. Winning nearly 10% of seats, the group were billed as kingmakers in a more fragmented European parliament, as the two largest groups, the centre-right and centre-left, saw their decades-old dominance collapse. More than a year on, the European Union has adopted its greenest-ever agenda, with the promise of net-zero emissions by 2050 and a European Green Deal to transform the economy, underpinned by a target to spend nearly one-third of EU funds on climate change and the environment. But even the staunchest Green politician does not try to grab the credit. The green cause has been lifted by growing awareness of the unfolding climate emergency, as well as the school strike movement led by Greta Thunberg. “We have a [European] commission that at least has green ambitions like no other commission before,” said Philippe Lamberts, co-president of the Greens in the European parliament.  “We are strong in the European parliament but don’t overdo it,” he added. “With 10% you get influence, but they can still decide to govern without you and that is what they basically did.” Despite being wooed with the European Green Deal, the Greens declined to support the commission led by centre-right Ursula von der Leyen. Green strength is also overstated by their structure in the European parliament. About one in six members of the Greens-European Free Alliance, to use their full name, belong to non-green parties, such as the Czech Pirates or Catalan nationalists. And the Greens are far from the only party wanting to save the planet. The chair of the European parliament’s influential environment committee, who was responsible for a resolution declaring a climate emergency, is allied to Emmanuel Macron, the French president. Pascal Canfin, a former head of WWF France, once sat as a Green MEP, but joined forces with the French president (although not his party, La République en Marche) when re-elected to Brussels and Strasbourg. Green MEPs, nevertheless, “punch above their weight when it comes to public attention and agenda-setting”, said Sophie Pornschlegel at the European Policy Centre. Green MEPs have won influence by mastering specialist policy briefs, such as the former Luxembourg MEP turned energy minister Claude Turmes, who co-wrote EU law on renewables, or Heidi Hautala of Finland, long-time transparency campaigner, or Sven Giegold of Germany, a one-man mission against tax avoidance and government sleaze. Greens are also now sitting around cabinet tables in five of the EU’s 27 member states, where they have forced the pace on climate laws. As the price for entering a centre-right/liberal coalition, Ireland’s Greens secured a promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 7% a year. Finland’s left-green coalition has pledged to go carbon neutral by 2035, while Austria’s Greens, the junior coalition partner, secured a similar target for 2040. Sweden’s Social-Democrat/Green government has promised “an entirely fossil-free welfare state” by 2045. But green influence only goes so far. Austria’s Greens accepted some hardline policies that were hard to swallow for grassroots activists, such as extending a headscarf ban in schools. And Greens’ limited sway was obvious at a landmark EU summit in July, when leaders agreed a coronavirus recovery plan. Some of the “frugal” governments taking the toughest line against EU spending were those with green coalition partners, such as Austria, Finland and Sweden. “They did whatever they could,” said Lamberts, who points out there is not a single EU leader from a Green party. “In a crucial decision place you’re not present... We try to make up for it with a stronger stance with organised civil society. We try to take the more traditional forces in a sort of pincer to basically force [governments] to go in directions they won’t go spontaneously.” Greens are not the only pan-European movement tied up in political knots – Swedish and Finnish Social Democrats in those frugal governments did not make common cause with their Spanish and Portuguese allies. And one of the biggest summit rows was between two leaders from the same political family – Macron and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte. The other big problem for Greens is their absence in southern, central and eastern Europe, apart from a few patchy successes, such as the election of a green mayor in Budapest or the return of an independent Portuguese MEP, who sits with the Greens. Despite these green shoots, the party is “still very much a north-western phenomenon”, said Pascal LeTendre-Hanns, who monitors European politics at Hanbury Strategy. “In southern Europe the focus has been so much on the economy and jobs, it has been hard for green parties to get much of a foothold,” he said, adding these countries lack “the historical legacy of anti-nuclear movements that helped push the Greens” elsewhere. In central and eastern Europe, voters are also very focused on the economy, but there is “more anxiety about the energy transition” because of high levels of coal and gas use, LeTendre-Hanns said. “Without a significant reinvention of what green politics is in these countries it’s hard to see green politics gaining much of a foothold.” Lamberts contends the Greens could gain in Italy in the 2024 European elections from voters disillusioned with the Five Star Movement. His optimism is not borne out by recent opinion polls, which show Italy’s Europa Verde almost invisible at 1%. But his main hope is for France and Germany, after Greens won major French cities in recent local elections and continue to be touted as a coalition partner in a future German centre-right/green government. The MEP hopes the Greens could win in triple figures in the 2024 elections. “If we are not able to do more than 100 next time, then who are we? If anything, Covid adds to the awareness of the need to change policy.” Nothing is guaranteed, but Petros Fassoulas, secretary general of the European Movement International, thinks the door is open. “If they are able to prove that they are effective policymakers as well as campaigners and if other parties are not successful in co-opting the policies for their own benefit, I believe we can see a stronger trend – not least because the questions around climate policies and environment are not going to go away.”"
"Australia’s environment is in an unsustainable state of decline and laws set up to protect unique species and habitats are ineffective, a major review of the national environmental framework has found. The interim report from the review of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act recommends sweeping changes, including the establishment of a set of legally enforceable national environmental standards that set clear rules for environmental protection while allowing for sustainable development. It also recommends the establishment of an independent environmental regulator to monitor and enforce compliance with environmental laws. “The EPBC Act is ineffective. It does not enable the commonwealth to protect and conserve environmental matters that are important for the nation,” the chair of the review, Graeme Samuel, said. “It is not fit to address current or future environmental challenges.” The report’s first lines are stark: “Australia’s natural environment and iconic places are in an overall state of decline and are under increasing threat. The current environmental trajectory is unsustainable.” It finds that community concern about the state of Australia’s environment is high but trust in both national environmental laws and in state and territory governments to deliver environmental protection is low.  Samuel’s report says the act is too focused on process and is not clear on what environmental outcomes it is trying to achieve for matter of national environmental significance. The report says there is duplication between national and state and territory processes, processes are cumbersome, and that efforts to harmonise laws at federal and state level have not gone far enough. It also confirms several reports by Guardian Australia examining failures under the act, including that once species are listed as threatened little effort is made to recover them, that the act creates no requirement to do so and that less than 40% of listed species and habitats have recovery plans. “The way the EPBC Act currently operates implies that the goal is to list a species and prepare a plan, rather than achieve environmental outcomes,” the report states. “Under these arrangements it is not surprising that the list of threatened species and communities has increased over time and there have been very few species that have recovered to the point that they can be removed from the list.” The review finds the government has not effectively managed threats to species, has stopped listing key threats, and that coordinated plans to address major threats – such as feral pests – are “ad hoc” rather than a national priority. It recommends a more coordinated regional approach to both recovery and threat abatement. It concludes that the current project-by-project approach of the act is not addressing the cumulative harm done to the environment, and the effect of this is environmental decline, rather than protection and conservation. The centrepiece of Samuel’s proposed reforms would be a set of national environmental standards that would underpin any devolution of powers to the states and territories. He recommends the government develop a set of interim standards as a first step, in consultation with state governments, Indigenous, science, environmental and business stakeholders, as well as the community. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the government would immediately commit to developing national environmental standards and would start conversations that would devolve responsibility for environmental approvals to state governments. The government plans to put legislation on bilateral approval agreements to parliament in late August before Samuel releases his final report in October. Environment groups expressed immediate concern the government was pushing ahead to accredit state and territory approvals processes before the final report was handed down. Samuel recommended that an independent regulator should monitor and enforce compliance with the law, but the government said on Monday it would not be pursuing this. Samuel’s review also found that few decisions under the laws had been subject to legal challenges, and he said he was unconvinced by claims that projects had become subject to so-called “lawfare” by activists. But Ley said on Monday she would speak to the attorney general, Christian Porter, about community rights to legal challenges under the Act. “Not surprisingly, the statutory review is finding that 20-year-old legislation is struggling to meet the changing needs of the environment, agriculture, community planners and business,” Ley said. “This is our chance to ensure the right protection for our environment while also unlocking job-creating projects to strengthen our economy and improve the livelihoods of everyday Australians.” Guardian Australia has spent more than two years examining systemic failings under the act. This reporting has uncovered widespread problems, including poor monitoring of endangered species, major delays in the listing of threatened species and ecosystems, failure to develop, update and implement recovery plans for species and habitats threatened with extinction, failure to list key threats to species, failure to protect important habitat, and threatened species funding being used for projects that do not benefit threatened species. Samuel’s report finds serious enforcement of environmental laws is rare and when penalties have been issued they were weak. It says the act has failed Indigenous Australians and recommends much better incorporation of traditional knowledge of country into environmental decision-making. Ley said the government would move to modernise protection of Indigenous heritage, beginning with a roundtable meeting of state Indigenous and environment ministers The report also finds that environmental offsets are failing, delivering losses for the environment due to poor design and implementation. It recommends they be used only as a last resort when other options to avoid or mitigate environmental damage have been “demonstrably exhausted”. The report says development proposals should have to specifically address how their projects will mitigate or avoid climate damage but specifically rules out a climate trigger, which many environmental groups had called for. Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the organisation was “deeply concerned” the government appeared ready to devolve powers to the states before the final report was released and without articulating how it would strengthen protections for species like the koala. “Advancing bilateral approvals with states before the final review is putting the cart before the horse,” she said. O’Shanassy also called for the government to adopt Samuel’s recommendation for an independent regulator. “An independent regulator would be the voice our flora and fauna need to hold the government to account and make sure the law actually does the job of protecting nature,” she said. “Right now state environmental protection standards are weaker than the national standards and improving them will take some time. “Without strong standards that protect nature, fast-tracking approvals will simply fast-track extinction.” Suzanne Milthorpe, the Wilderness Society’s national environment laws campaign manager, said the review outlined the “catastrophic impact of 20 years of failure in Australia’s environment laws, impacts that have been in plain sight throughout the operation of the EPBC Act”. “Now this Coalition government is asking us to trust them on immediately handing environmental safeguards to the states while promising at some time in the future to make changes of an ill-defined nature to improve environmental standards,” she said. “Professor Samuel’s report outlines that environment laws are rarely policed, that endangered species recovery plans are rarely implemented, that Australia’s most important environmental values are in decline and yet the central government response is to seek to hand environmental approval powers to the states with no concrete proposals to address any of the main environmental challenges facing Australia.” Nicola Beynon, the head of campaigns at Humane Society International, said the organisation welcomed the notion of robust national environmental standards but had “deep concerns that the interim standards proposed today are simply not strong enough”. “We do not want to see standards that enshrine the status quo for threatened species. This is the moment that the government needs to step up protection for nature with stronger standards,” she said. Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said the report “describes the government’s woeful failures to protect the environment”. “Labor will consider the interim report in detail. We call on the government to do the same,” she said. “We are disappointed the government has already begun cherry-picking the report’s recommendations.” The Greens environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, spoke to the minister on Monday afternoon. Hanson-Young said without change, environmental decline would continue. She was concerned the government had already rejected a proposal for an independent regulator. “Environmental standards will be worthless if there is no one there to enforce them,” she said. "
"Land-clearing in New South Wales has risen nearly 60% since the state relaxed its native vegetation laws in 2017, new government data shows. The report shows 60,800 hectares of woody vegetation was cleared in 2018, up from 58,000 hectares the previous year and an average of 38,800 hectares between 2009 and 2017. Of this clearing, 73% was unexplained, meaning it wasn’t referred to the state government for an environmental assessment, either because an approval was not required or the clearing may have been conducted unlawfully. The 2018 data signals a jump of 57% on the long-term average for the state and follows the government’s introduction of more lenient land-clearing laws in August 2017. About half (29,400ha) of the 2018 woody vegetation clearing was for agriculture, 23,300ha for forestry and 8,100ha for infrastructure projects. The amount of agricultural clearing in the state was more than double the 2009-17 average of 12,300 ha. The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, said he was concerned by the numbers and the need for habitat protection was now greater than ever. “We need to get the balance right,” he said. “Following the bushfires, it’s more important than ever to protect habitat for native species, especially koalas. “There is a review coming up of the laws which will look at the effectiveness of environmental protections.” The state’s north-west and central west each recorded huge rises in the amount of unexplained clearing. In the north-west region, unexplained clearing of both woody and non-woody vegetation (grasses, small shrubs and ground cover) increased from 3,666ha in 2017 to 22,310ha in 2018. In the central west, it grew from 2,270ha to 14,088ha. The independent MP Justin Field called on the government to investigate, saying the data showed biodiversity and land-clearing reform in the state had resulted in “rampant deforestation”. “There is little wonder we face the extinction of the koala in NSW if this level of deforestation is being allowed under the Berejiklian government,” he said. He said the government had ignored a Natural Resources Commission report from early this year that labelled NSW’s land-clearing laws a “state-wide risk to biodiversity”. Field said the government should investigate the large increase in unexplained clearing and suspend the two-year statute of limitations on prosecutions for illegal land-clearing. “I’m calling for the statute of limitations on prosecutions for illegal land-clearing to be suspended until the public can be reassured that investigation and enforcement is able to proceed unhindered,” he said. “It would be too easy for those landholders who have done the wrong thing to try to drag out the investigation process to avoid prosecution.” Guardian Australia reported last week on WWF analysis that found more than a million hectares of land had been cleared in NSW and Queensland without referral to the federal environment department for assessment. Stuart Blanch, a conservation scientist at WWF Australia, said the rise in unexplained clearing was also identified in the NSW government’s previous land clearing report a year ago. “They’ve got what they wanted,” he said. “They wrote such weak laws it’s caused a land clearing tsunami. “I don’t think the Nationals want to know about it. Because if they did monitor and attribute it and found out there was a lot of illegal clearing they would have to prosecute it.” A scathing report by the Australian National Audit Office noted that agricultural clearing was rarely being referred to the federal department for an assessment under national environmental law. The interim report from a statutory review of Australia’s national environmental laws is due shortly.  "
"The station car park on the town’s busiest road must be the least discreet place to go birding. But how else can you monitor common swifts, given that they nest only in domestic rooftops? The station just happens to have the best panorama over their breeding habitat. As we stood here five other groups were dotted strategically about town performing the same sky-gazing exercise. Together we attempted a coordinated count of the Buxton total. Swifts once bred throughout this area but modern roofing practices have eradicated many of the niches that they once used and it’s striking how they seem to survive best where perhaps the older, traditional slate roofs are intact. Our census is part of a scheme to help the local swift population, which has probably shared in the species’ nationwide decline of 53% in just 25 years. To reverse this locally, the Buxton Civic Association, an organisation devoted to the town’s natural and built environment, initiated a project to create additional nesting accommodation. More than £1,000 has provided scores of state-of-the-art nest units that reflect the latest research on swifts’ breeding preferences. But what is really heartening is that our Buxton efforts are replicated, not just across Britain, but also Europe. Social media is heavily populated with those who feel the same passionate concern and I doubt there is another organism that could have aroused the same mixture of public anxiety, determination and love. Why do we do it? I’ll offer you a glimpse of what I think is at play. Our count that night was down by roughly 50%, because swifts, faced with the recent 48-hour spell of non-stop rain showers, fly right around such wet weather systems and continue to feed while their chicks and partners survive by fasting. Half of Buxton’s swifts could have been flying and feeding over Exeter or Bournemouth. In short, swifts make their own weather. When the skies clear they head home, bringing a sense of wonder and mystery with them. Sometimes they travel more than 1,800km in rain-avoidance excursions. If that isn’t an animal worth fighting for (or receiving funny looks at the station for) I don’t know what is."
"Laws to protect biodiversity in Ukrainian forests are failing to prevent environmentally unsustainable logging that is harming wildlife, and the resulting timber is being sold to EU consumers as ethical and sustainable, a green campaign group has alleged. Trees are being felled during silent periods, when forests are supposed to be left intact so that birds and other wildlife can nest and reproduce, according to an investigation by the environmental charity Earthsight. Loggers appear to be taking advantage of loopholes that allow for “sanitary felling” during the silent periods, according to a report by Earthsight. Sanitary felling is sometimes necessary to stop the spread of disease and pests such as the European bark beetle. But it is hard to judge how much felling is really needed, and whether the harvesting is taking place under strict controls. Earthsight has uncovered evidence of felling during the silent periods in the spring and early summer from 2018 to this year. Previous research by the organisation found similar harvesting during the silent periods in preceding years. Some of the wood allegedly felled during silent periods is going to companies that supply the Swedish furniture maker Ikea, according to Earthsight. Ikea denied wrongdoing and told the Guardian it would cut off any supplier found to have breached its stringent rules on sustainability. The company said: “Ikea does not accept illegally logged wood in our products. When we encounter any information that indicates wood which does not meet our requirements has entered or is at risk of entering our supply chain, we take immediate action.” The company said last year its forestry specialists carried out several audits across Ukraine and Romania and no illegally logged wood was discovered. The latest audit carried out on the supply chain in question was in April 2020, and did not indicate any illegal wood, the company said. The company has also begun an independent audit of VGSM, the supplier named in the Earthsight report as allegedly felling timber in contravention of the regulations. “We take the issues raised by Earthsight’s recent report very seriously and immediately began investigations with all mentioned partners,” said a spokesperson for Ikea. VGSM told the Guardian that the area of forest cited in the Earthsight report, Velykyi Bychkiv, was being operated within Ukrainian regulations. In a detailed reply to the Guardian, the company referred to “the absurdity of the law” and to a conflict between the law which establishes a silent period in which trees may not be felled, to protect biodiversity, and the requirements for sanitary felling. “How is it possible to simultaneously carry out sanitary measures in the shortest possible time but at the same time postponing it for two and a half months [because of the silent period]?” The company rejected claims that it had contravened the rules or the standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), which certifies wood as coming from sustainable sources: “VGSM LLC highly values the FSC standards and cooperation with its foreign partners. Therefore, we never violate their requirements.” Ukrainian laws intended to protect forests are open to abuse, according to the FSC, which certifies timber from Ukraine and other countries as coming from environmentally sustainable sources. Earthsight has accused the FSC of certifying timber as sustainable when it is not. “This legislation is not clear, therefore the interpretation is not clear,” Kim Carstensen, director general of the FSC, told the Guardian. “It is likely that some of the logging [that has taken place] is illegal. It is likely that the uncertainties in the legislation are being used by some companies to do logging that they should not.” But he said that the uncertainties meant it was impossible to say for sure whether companies were acting within the law. Asking for a blanket ban on sanitary felling, which some companies may be using as a cover for extensive logging, would be counterproductive, said Carstensen, because protections against diseases and pests were still needed. “We are asking for clarification of the law,” he said. Serhiy Komarchuk, head of the department of ecological control at the State Environmental Inspectorate of Ukraine, told the Guardian that a fine had been imposed for infringements of the felling regulations in the Velykyi Bychkiv forest in 2018. “During visit to Velykyi Bychkiv SFE [State Forestry Enterprise] in 2018, State Environmental Inspectorate of Ukraine found that the SFE had been unabashedly issuing felling tickets for sanitary felling during this ‘silence period’, allowing swaths of forest to be illegally cut. The inspectors identified 109 different sites where illegal sanitary felling had been scheduled during the silence period,” said Komarchuk."
"Up to 11,000 renewable energy workers are expected to lose their jobs over the next two years under current government policies, according to a university analysis. If correct, the loss of jobs would be equivalent to the abolition of the domestic-focused coal industry, which employs a little more than 10,000 people in mining thermal coal for local use and running Australia’s coal-fired power plants. Described as the first large-scale survey of renewable energy jobs in Australia, the research from the University of Technology Sydney found the industry would be a major source of jobs in the medium term, but its short-term future would depend on how Covid-19 stimulus packages were deployed. About 26,000 people are employed in renewable energy, but the study found this would fall to about 15,000 by 2022 under existing policies, including the Morrison government not replacing the national renewable energy target. The target, which requires energy companies to source about 23% of electricity from clean sources, was reached last year, triggering a 50% drop in large-scale renewable energy investment compared with 2018. Conversely, renewable energy jobs would be expected to reach about 45,000 by 2025 under a “step change” scenario, set out by the Australian Energy Market Operator, consistent with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement. The study says on this path employment in renewables would be likely to fall to about 30,000 as construction eased later this decade before rising again after 2030. Chris Briggs, a research principal at the UTS Institute for Sustainable Futures, said up to two-thirds of renewable energy jobs would be expected to be created in regional areas. “It’s a difference of 30,000 jobs in the next few years depending on government policy,” he said. Many of the jobs would be expected to be in identified renewable energy zones. The zones overlap with existing coal regions but are more widespread. Briggs said it suggested renewable energy could play a meaningful role alongside other industries in creating replacement jobs in coal regions as the world reduced reliance on fossil fuels, but only if the transition was well planned and funded. Coalmining employs about 40,000 Australians, mostly for exporting companies. “If we wait until south-east Asia stops using our coal things are going to be pretty dire,” Briggs said. The study estimates the number of renewable energy jobs in solar, wind, hydro and batteries. It does not include related jobs in building transmission infrastructure, or new fields they may develop such as renewable hydrogen. Business groups, the energy industry, unions and major investors are among those to have called for post-Covid stimulus spending to be designed to also address the climate crisis. The Morrison government has backed a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic, and has not prioritised climate-friendly policies as part of its response. On Wednesday, the New South Wales government released a statement on coal exploration and mining that said the industry would generate regional jobs and royalties to pay for public services and infrastructure for decades to come. John Barilaro, the deputy premier and resources minister, said while it would be important to diversify regional economies “over the next few decades” its response to coronavirus would include fast-tracking coalmining investment. He said it was not at odds with the government’s development of renewable energy zones in the state’s central west. “The good news story today is there is a strong future for coal, a strong future for mining here in New South Wales, and more importantly (it is) part of the engine room that will get us out of the crisis,” he told reporters in the Hunter Valley. The NSW government coal statement appears to assume the world will not meet the climate goals agreed in Paris five years ago. It suggests demand for thermal coal, which is burned in power stations, will fall by only about 10% over the next 30 years. It expects coal use for electricity to roughly double in both south-east Asia and the Indian Ocean region by 2050. Tim Buckley, from the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said this assumed a world of catastrophic climate change, and was at odds with the global push by banks and institutional investors worth of trillions of dollars for the world to move away from thermal coal, leading to commitments to exit coal by several major producers. Buckley gave the example of the Indian government, which had repeatedly said it wanted to end the country’s reliance on thermal coal imports by 2023-24 as it expanded local coalmining and renewable energy. The International Energy Agency, which has been criticised for underestimating the rise of renewable energy, has modelled two scenarios of future thermal coal use – one roughly similar to that adopted by the NSW government, the other vastly different. Under its “stated policies scenario”, coal demand stays flat until 2040. Under its “sustainable development scenario”, the amount of coal burned would be cut by more than half over the next 20 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was likely to require coal power being cut by between 59% and 78% below 2010 levels by 2030, and for greenhouse gas emissions to reach net zero by 2050. The UTS research, which formed the basis of a briefing paper by the Clean Energy Council earlier this month, will be presented at University of Melbourne seminar on Thursday."
"Environmental groups say “paltry” fines handed to a coalmine in Queensland’s Darling Downs show that state authorities are unwilling to take action over even the most serious and repeated environmental breaches by miners. Documents obtained under Queensland freedom of information laws by Guardian Australia show the New Acland coalmine in Queensland’s Darling Downs was caught violating noise limits 34 separate times in 10 weeks and was fined $9,461 by state authorities. The Department of Environment and Science decided against pursuing a more serious penalty, despite finding the facts were “indisputable”, the noise created a “major impact” and the miner’s actions were “intentional”. Last year Guardian Australia revealed the same miner drilled 27 illegal bores in the Darling Downs and received a $3,152 fine. In both cases, the department believed the fines would act as a deterrent to the company. Its parent, New Hope Group, was worth about $2.3bn at the time. A decision memo outlined that the department began an investigation in January 2018 into whether New Acland was complying with noise limits in its environmental authority. Between June and August 2018, the department conducted noise monitoring at the site. A report on the monitoring outlined how on 34 occasions during that period, the noise levels measured exceeded limits in New Acland’s environmental authority. On one occasion, the noise exceeded World Health Organisation criteria for sleep disturbance, due to more than 10 “impulse events” during a one-hour period. The memo, dated April 2019, says the department had told New Acland it had concerns about noise from mining activities, but that the miner had taken no action. “DES has informed [New Acland] of its mining activities’ alleged impact to the acoustic objectives of sensitive receptors and no additional abatement measures have been employed,” it said. “Mining activities subject to noise complaints have continued therefore it is alleged that the actions are intentional, however it is not clear that the causing of the nuisance is wilful.” The memo argued the lesser penalty should be imposed – despite the “ongoing nature of the offence” – because it was difficult to prove what activities were causing the noise impacts. The department released a statement to the Toowoomba Chronicle newspaper in May 2019 about the fine, which it described as “strong enforcement action”. However, until the release of the memo more than a year later, no information was made public about the extent of the breaches, their alleged seriousness and the department’s internal considerations. Lock the Gate, which obtained the decision memo, says the document shows the environmental regulator is “a toothless tiger”. “According to their own compliance guideline, DES should have prosecuted New Hope for this ongoing offence that caused a major impact,” Lock the Gate Queensland spokeswoman Ellie Smith said. “Instead they were handed a paltry fine of just $9,461, which will do nothing to bring this rogue company and repeat offender into line. “New Acland absolutely should have been prosecuted, because the document shows the noise had a major impact and that New Acland was culpable. “This failure by the government to appropriately penalise New Acland, which has a history of serious violations, is an insult to the communities and farmers who have been devastated by this mine.” New Hope said in a statement that it was “committed to continuous improvement of our operations” and had implemented extensive management measures to address potential noise and vibration impacts at the mine. A spokesman for the company said the measures included real-time monitoring; adaptive measures to reduce, relocate or stop noisy activities; an after-hours contact number for neighbours; installing mufflers on mining equipment; and using stockpiles as noise barriers for works where possible. A department spokesman said the fine “was considered an appropriate enforcement response based on the circumstances of the alleged offence”. “DES continues to monitor the activities of the New Acland coalmine.” New Acland has been under investigation by Queensland authorities for two years in relation to allegations of illegal mining, related to activities conducted within its mining lease, but outside areas defined as “pits” on its environmental approval. The ABC reported last week the miner was now also being investigated by federal environment authorities for alleged noncompliance. New Hope said it “vehemently rejects any suggestion it is unlawfully mining at Acland”. “This is yet another example of opportunistic green activist groups, with an agenda, bringing up spurious claims and using lawfare against New Hope Group in an attempt to frustrate and delay the approvals of New Acland stage 3, delaying vital job-creating projects in regional Queensland.” The long-proposed expansion of the mine remains in limbo. Earlier this month landholders won the right to take an appeal against the expansion’s environmental approval to the high court. Meanwhile, New Hope Group has continued to lobby the state government to grant its final approvals, which include mining leases and a water licence. It says the project will create 487 jobs in 18 months and contribute $7bn to the state economy."
"Meadow browns are jinking along lanes, small tortoiseshells are unusually abundant on bramble flowers and purple emperors are attacking drones (trying to film them) in Knepp wildland in West Sussex. This week’s heatwave – after three months of what Butterfly Conservation’s Richard Fox calls “nigh on perfect butterfly conditions” – is delivering peak butterfly. Butterfly Conservation’s garden butterfly survey reports orange tips in 73% of gardens this spring compared with 56% in 2019 and 2018. Some may be the lockdown effect (we are paying more attention) but this third hot summer in a row is enabling butterfly numbers to build up. Seeking a butterfly challenge? Anyone living south of York could visit a local wood and look for purple emperors and the graceful, gliding white admiral. If you’re near the east coast, check for southern small whites – conditions are perfect for this continental species to become Britain’s 60th resident butterfly. Scottish butterfly fans could find new white-letter hairstreak and small and Essex skipper colonies – all expanding northwards. If you’re near Portland, search for the elusive large tortoiseshell – this “extinct” butterfly is making a comeback. But mainly, just enjoy this abundance which is hopeful, uplifting and, as Richard Fox says, “fills that hole in our souls”."
"Short answer: it’s full. Warragamba Dam sits on Sydney’s outer western fringe, and is the city’s main reservoir, supplying about 80% of its water. Built more than 60 years ago, it draws on six rivers in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment. It hit 100% capacity on Monday, having filled rapidly during heavy rain periods this year. A year ago it was less than half full. However, level-one water restrictions are still in force across greater Sydney. It’s possible, but not expected at this point. Experts say it would require a significant rain event to force a large uncontrolled spill that affected suburbs downriver. There have been significant spills before, in August 1998 and March 2012. For now, gates release water gradually into the Warragamba River at safe levels. State agency Water NSW said the dam began spilling on Sunday, initially at a rate of 100m litres a day, lifting to about 4,000m litres a day on Monday and peaking at 9bn litres a day at midnight. On Tuesday, the agency said it opened a radial gate to discharge at a controlled rate of 7,000m litres a day with a goal of reducing the water to one metre below the full supply level, a process that would take a few weeks. The agency said about 10,000m litres were flowing into the dam each day, but that rate was falling. It was working with the State Emergency Service and Bureau of Meteorology to “assess and prepare for future rain events”. Stuart Khan, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New South Wales, agreed the risk of severe flooding was real if there was heavy rain, but stressed the “if“. He said a series of bottlenecks down the Warragamba and Nepean river increased the threat to homes if there was a major spill, but the dam being at 100% capacity was not itself cause for alarm. The NSW government is proposing to raise the dam wall by 17 metres to reduce the risk of flooding in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley. The controversial project has been in development since 2017 and will require environmental assessment and approval at both a state and federal level. The state originally proposed raising the dam wall by 14 metres but lifted that to 17 metres in June. The plan has been delayed. Water NSW was due to finish an environmental impact statement, examining the potential impact on natural and cultural heritage, last year but it is still being drafted. Leaked documents show state and federal environmental agencies have raised concerns about the quality of the assessments Water NSW is relying on, and the impact the project would have on the Blue Mountains world heritage area. The NSW government has planned for a construction period from 2020 to 2024, assuming the project is granted environmental approval and the business case stands up. The project is not about increasing Sydney’s water supply. The government says raising the dam wall will reduce the risk to human life and of property damage on the floodplain. Local government areas in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley include Penrith, Hawkesbury City, the Hills Shire and Blacktown. The flood risk is projected to increase due to the climate crisis. In 2017, Infrastructure NSW said there were up to 134,000 people living and working on the floodplain who could require evacuation if there was a major flood. It said urban expansion could double the number of people at risk over the next 30 years. The government says lifting the dam wall would give it greater capacity to temporarily hold floodwater before releasing it in a controlled way. Experts have questioned this rationale. In a submission to a NSW parliamentary inquiry examining the proposal, Jamie Pittock, from Australian National University’s Fenner school of environment and society, said it was driven by a desire to expand residential and commercial development. Pittock argued that this would put an additional 134,000 people in the potential flood path, and warned this sort of strategy had failed elsewhere, notably the 2011 Brisbane floods in which 35 people died. The government responds that the region has to plan for population growth. But the dam raising, and holding more water in the Blue Mountains world heritage area upstream from the dam, will have potentially serious environmental and cultural ramifications. A summary of the environmental impact statement, contained in a leaked federal environment department document, suggests it could affect half the remaining global population of the critically endangered regent honeyeater and would put forest and woodland communities at risk of extinction. It is estimated it could kill 238 greater gliders, a vulnerable species seriously affected by the recent bushfire disaster. Officials expressed concern that Water NSW’s environmental assessments did not adequately assess risks to other endangered species, and failed to consider the impact of last season’s bushfires. Conservationists have warned the project could also wipe out as many as 50 recognised Aboriginal heritage sites. The world heritage committee has expressed concern the upstream flooding could affect the Blue Mountains’ outstanding universal values that made them a globally recognised. In response to reporting by Guardian Australia and the Sydney Morning Herald, the NSW parliamentary committee examining the proposal will convene next week to scrutinise the leaked material. The committee’s chair, the independent MLC Justin Field, said the government had previously sought to avoid questions about the adequacy of the environmental assessments by saying all issues raised would be addressed in the final impact statement. He said he was shocked by the extent of the criticism by officials in the leaked documents, and it was vital the state’s flood strategy received detailed public scrutiny. Stuart Ayres, the minister for western Sydney, said this year has shown an east coast low could fill the dam at breathtaking speed. Widespread rain in February had increased the dam level 30% in a few days. He said if the dam had been more than 80% full at that point, with no flood mitigation wall, the valley below would have “been in a lot of trouble”. “Without a raised dam wall there would be no opportunity to allow water to recede in the catchment forward of the dam before releasing water,” he said. “The only outcome in this situation is a more severe flood.” But Pittock said there were flaws in the government’s analysis. In his submission to the inquiry, he said flood mitigation dams tended to help during small and medium-sized floods only and that there was “no configuration of the Warragamba Dam” that would prevent flooding in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley. On average, 45% of floodwaters that reached the valley came from other catchments that were not upstream of the dam. “There would still be people in harm’s way,” he told Guardian Australia. “Almost no matter how big you build a dam inevitably there will be a flood the dam cannot hold.”"
"Something clamps the skin on my right arm and I look to see: a flattened arrow, ashy coloured and the size of a fingernail, is on my forearm. Reflexively I shove it off. It leaves a swelling globe of blood behind, and I peer at it. “Horsefly,” my wife says. It’s a hot day. A walk outside the bewitching village of Easton on the Hill on a route we haven’t taken before has taken us along rights of way, into farmland. Within sight of the steeples of the town we live in, the packing of a map for such novel walks is now a regular occurrence: the exploring of ways near home one of the few welcome discoveries of so much time spent closer to it. This route is clumsy, grasping those dashed green lines rather than landscape logic. Paths through cornfields, along a road and down a field edge. Flies have only been around this last few hundred yards. First a cloud of gnats over each of our four heads, then the horsefly on me. I haven’t been bitten by one before; it hurts, worse than a midge, not as bad as a wasp – probably annoying later, like a mosquito. A notch-horned cleg fly, probably. This Tabanidae family of blood-sucking flies are a bewilderment of rural christenings: horseflies, dun-flies, clegs, stouts. As with most insect biters, it’s the females who get you, and it’s a queasy process I’ve just enjoyed, as I would learn later. The lower jaw punctures, the upper jaw slices, a salivary gland dumps in an anti-clotting agent and a sucking tube enters the wound. Fast, nasty, fiercely efficient work. It’s the inflammatory season, the summer: the flies, the sharp foliage, the itches, the sweat, the sun. And, perhaps inevitably, the blood – albeit in that parochial sort of way. We reach the village again through neck-high crop, and three of us are now sporting little wounds: one from flies, another from thorns, and my three-year-old mysteriously bleeding from the leg. Our first worry, depressingly, is barbed wire. I wonder what that says, too. Horsefly blood I can deal with. I hope his isn’t from the barbed wire."
"The Amazon has seen the worst start to the fire season in a decade, with 10,136 fires spotted in the first 10 days of August, a 17% rise on last year. Analysis of Brazilian government figures by Greenpeace showed fires increasing by 81% in federal reserves compared with the same period last year. Coming a year after soaring Amazon fires caused an international crisis, the new figures raised fears this year’s fire season could be even worse than last year’s. “This is the direct result of this government’s lack of an environment policy,” said Romulo Batista, senior forest campaigner for Greenpeace Brasil. “We had more fires than last year.” The numbers are likely to add to the rising sense of alarm among business leaders and investors over the negative impact caused by the ongoing destruction of Brazil’s Amazon forest. “It is a very worrying situation. Clearly, the government’s environmental policy on the Amazon issue is not working,” Candido Bacher, the CEO of Brazil’s biggest bank, Itaú Unibanco, said on Wednesday. In July the government banned fires for 120 days in the Amazon and Pantanal regions, where fires are also raging. On Tuesday Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, falsely claimed reports of rising numbers of Amazon fires were “a lie”. His administration has been unable to control rising fires and deforestation despite an expensive army operation launched in May. Called Operation Green Brasil 2 and headed by vice-president General Hamilton Mourão, it involves thousands of soldiers, and according to the defence ministry has so far seized 28,100 cubic metres of wood and handed out £575,000 worth of fines. Fires in July were 28% up on a year ago, according to Brazil’s Space Research Institute (INPE), in charge of satellite monitoring. Deforestation from August 2019 to July 2020 is up 34%. And nobody has been charged over last year’s coordinated “Fire Day”, when fires tripled in the state of Pará alone on 10-11 August, especially around the Novo Progresso area, where 638 fires were spotted in the first 10 days of August. “It’s a lot of propaganda,” said Batista of the operation. “You don’t combat deforestation with an army operation, you do it working all year round with intelligence and coordination.” A year ago Bolsonaro sought to blame Leonardo DiCaprio and NGOs for fires despite providing no evidence – and sacked the head of INPE. On Tuesday, during a meeting of Amazon countries, he made more incorrect claims. “This story that the Amazon is going up in flames is a lie and we must combat it with true numbers,” Bolsonaro said, according to Reuters, which published photos of forest devastated by fire in Apuí municipality in Amazonas state. Fires in the Amazon dry season are mainly caused by people either clearing land, or burning felled trees or forest from which valuable woods have already been removed, Batista said. Much of that land becomes cattle pasture, responsible for 80% of deforestation in all Amazon countries. Greenpeace analysis showed that among the Amazon municipalities worst-hit by fires in the first 10 days of August were some of the region’s most important cattle producing areas. Last year the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported that Amazon fires were 30% more likely in beef farming zones. Brazil’s meat industry is coming under increasing pressure to stop cattle from illegally deforested Amazon areas contaminating supply chains. Its biggest companies said they have made huge progress in monitoring in recent years and are developing new strategies to improve it. On Wednesday, Candido Bracher from Itaú Unibanco said the bank would not finance meat companies linked to deforestation. “We want to guarantee the industry won’t be supplied by meat from herds raised in deforested areas,” he told the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper. “We will do this by tracing.” Itaú Unibanco is part of the Brazilian Business Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS), which has held meetings with Mourão, supreme court judges and Congress leaders to demand action to protect the Amazon, while avoiding confronting the anti-environmentalist stance of key government figures who have disputed climate change science. “This is not an ideological issue,” said its president, Marina Grossi. “When you do not have a clear policy on this you compromise these companies. You lose value and the country loses.”"
"Plans to build a four-lane road tunnel under the Thames in London should be dropped as part of an overhaul of transport spending in the capital, campaigners say. Opponents of the proposed £1.2bn Silvertown tunnel scheme have written to the authors of two separate reviews of Transport for London finances, asking them to look again at the project. Victoria Rance, of the Stop Silvertown Tunnel Coalition, said that if the reviews – one being run from No 10 and the other by independent experts commissioned by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan – examined the tunnel scheme, they would see it was “fatally flawed”. “We hope that the reviewers will carefully examine the economic case, the initial assessment of options, and the funding arrangements for the Silvertown tunnel,” Rance said. “If they do, they will certainly find that there are fatal errors in TfL’s workings; that building this £1.2bn project is not just environmentally destructive but offers almost zero economic benefit.” If it goes ahead, the tunnel would be funded with a loan to be repaid by introducing tolls on the Blackwall and Silvertown tunnels. Rance said the scheme would undermine efforts to clean up the capital’s air, as well as the mayor’s wider environmental targets. “Scrapping Silvertown and using the income from tolling the Blackwall tunnel to protect at-risk public transport and active travel schemes … offers far better value for money, and far better environmental outcomes for Londoners than building a massive new road in a climate emergency,” she said. A spokesperson for Khan defended the scheme, saying it was essential to improve river-crossing in east London. “A new tunnel at Silvertown is important as the existing infrastructure is both antiquated and worn out, and it will be funded by a toll, not TfL cash,” they said. The spokesperson said the introduction of tolls and the extension of the ultra-low emission zone from 2021 would “play a crucial role in tackling congestion, improving air quality and providing much-needed additional bus services across the river”. The mayor has introduced a raft of environmental measures ranging from declaring a climate emergency to setting a 2030 carbon-neutral target. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, London has unveiled plans for one of the biggest walking and cycling zones of any capital city, to encourage people out of their cars. Khan’s spokesperson was adamant the Silvertown tunnel project would not undermine those aims. “[Khan] has been clear that he doesn’t want to replace one health crisis with another, and he is determined that our city’s recovery from coronavirus will be clean, green and sustainable,” they said. In June a report from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, backed by some of the UK’s leading climate scientists, found the Silvertown tunnel was incompatible with the Greater London Authority’s aim to become carbon-neutral by 2030. In a sign of the growing opposition to the scheme, Extinction Rebellion activists locked themselves to a drilling rig at the site last month in an attempt to hold up preparatory work on the tunnel."
"Boris Johnson is poised to sign off new rules barring the UK government’s chief foreign lender from offering financial support to foreign fossil fuel projects. The new policy, which could come as soon as this week, will rule out future loans and financial guarantees for polluting projects overseas through the UK’s export credit agency, UK Export Finance, just weeks after it agreed to a £1bn financial package to support work on a gas project in Mozambique. Under the new rules no support may be offered to fossil fuel extraction or oil refining projects from 2021, apart from limited funding for gas-fired power plants “in exceptional circumstances”. The policy paper was handed to the prime minister’s office earlier this week, and may receive the greenlight from No 10 within days, according to sources. The move to curtail financial support for foreign fossil fuel projects comes after UKEF continued to grant loan guarantees, and direct funding, to British companies bidding for work on fossil fuel projects worth more than £3.5bn since the UK signed up to the Paris climate agreement. UKEF added to the tally of fossil fuel support last month with one of its largest financial support deals by agreeing to offer support worth £1bn to help develop a major gas project in Mozambique. It will offer loans worth $300m (£230m) to British companies working on the gas project and will also guarantee loans from commercial banks worth up to $850m. The funding plan raised hackles within the prime minister’s office earlier this summer, according to sources, because aides were told that Africa’s biggest ever financing deal was too far advanced for UKEF to abandon. The prime minister’s aides then called for an urgent review of the UK’s fossil fuel funding record – which green campaigners have described as “rank hypocrisy” following the government’s plans to reduce carbon emissions to virtually zero by 2050 and host the UN’s climate talks in Glasgow next year. Green groups are privately concerned that the new policy might still allow the funding of high emissions projects to move ahead overseas if it includes too many exemptions, or does not take effect soon enough. There is also concern that the new rules for UKEF should also extend to the government’s official overseas aid budget. A government spokesperson said: “The government keeps its support for the fossil fuels industry under review to ensure the UK reaches its net-zero target by 2050.”"
"The government’s long-awaited strategy for tackling floods in England does not go far enough and appears to conflict with Boris Johnson’s “build, build, build” plan for more housing, experts have said. Billed by ministers as the most comprehensive flood defence plan in a decade, the fresh approach will mean more money spent on natural solutions to counter floods, such as capturing water on fields. But the plan, unveiled on Tuesday, stopped short of banning any new building on land at the highest risk of flooding, disappointing experts, local authorities and flood-hit communities. Prof Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said the government’s pledge to review house building on floodplains did not “sound in tune” with the prime minister’s commitment to cutting red tape to build new homes more quickly under “Project Speed”. Cloke said: “A fortnight ago Boris was attacking ‘newt counting’ and bemoaning the pace of progress in the UK. Dealing with flooding shows precisely the difficulties behind his promise to build better, faster and greener. Sometimes being better and greener requires building more slowly and carefully, or we risk long-term economic and social costs that we cannot afford.” The government pledged in its 2020 budget to spend £5.2bn on flood defences by 2027, which it said would create about 2,000 new flood and coastal projects, and improve the protection of 336,000 properties in England. Academics welcomed the investment in natural flood solutions, such as hollows to catch floodwater, and the government’s support for making properties more resilient to floods. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said the government was considering giving the Environment Agency more powers to prevent building on high-risk floodplains but stopped short of saying that fewer homes should be built in these areas. About 20,000 homes a year are built on land at the highest risk of flooding in England, equating to one in 10 of all new homes since 2013. Planning policy says housing should be based in areas at the least risk of flooding, yet local authorities, which face penalties if they miss house-building targets, say they feel powerless to stop developments and are concerned these construction projects will only increase in number. Heather Shepherd, of the National Flood Forum, which supports at-risk communities, said the government was “asking for problems” by continuing to build on floodplains and plug new properties into ageing infrastructure. “If you’re to think of nature as a solution then our floodplains become precious and a resource to mitigate flooding. If we build on them we’re taking away a natural way of managing flood risk,” she said. Shaun Davies, the Labour leader of Telford and Wrekin council, Shropshire, which had weeks of floods in February, said there was little in the new government approach to reassure residents. Davies said he raised concerns with Eustice in February about the conversion of an old power station into 1,000 new homes on the Shropshire floodplain but that that development was still going ahead. The insurance firm Zurich said the extra cash to help flood-hit homeowners recover from damage “misses the point” and that at-risk residents need financial support to defend their homes “before extreme weather strikes – not after they have been flooded”. Eustice said: “Our record investment and ambitious policies will better protect homes, schools, hospitals and businesses, but we also recognise that we cannot prevent flooding entirely, which is why we will ensure that communities at high risk are more resilient.”"
"The UK’s Big Butterfly Count starts this week. Will air pollution improvements during lockdown increase your chances of seeing rare butterflies and moths? The best-known connection between Lepidoptera and air pollution is the peppered moth story. Dark forms appeared in industrial towns across the UK in the mid-1800s, and 50 years later about 90% of peppered moths were dark. It is thought these were better camouflaged, and therefore less likely to be eaten by birds, as they rested on trees that were blackened by air pollution and denuded of lichens. But, as air pollution improved, lighter-coloured moths increased in the UK and US. The disappearance of half of the butterfly species from Epping Forest, London, in the 19th and early 20th centuries was partly attributed to air pollution. Following the 1956 Clean Air Act, some species, including the purple hair streak, gatekeeper and speckled wood, returned. Further afield, the six-mile (10km) Kola peninsula around the Monchegorsk steelworks in Russia, became a largely butterfly-free zone in the 1990s. All wildlife suffered from acid rain from coal burning but butterflies seemed more sensitive than many plants. Today, our butterfly habitats are also being damaged by soil fertility changes caused by air pollution from traffic and farming. "
"Construction work has begun in Lincolnshire on the world’s longest subsea power cable, which will run between Britain and Denmark to share renewable energy between the two countries. The 475-mile (765km) cable is a joint-venture between National Grid in the UK and Denmark’s Energinet. By 2023, the high-voltage, direct-current link will transmit the equivalent of enough electricity to power 1.5m British homes between Bicker Fen in Lincolnshire and the South Jutland region in Denmark. The €2bn Viking Link project will surpass the 450-mile North Sea link, which will begin importing Norwegian hydropower to the UK from 2021. Viking Link is one of several new super-cable projects, which are each considered a significant step towards the UK’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions because National Grid will be able to tap more renewable energy resources to replace fossil fuels. The UK has about 5GW of power cable capacity connecting Britain’s electricity system to power generated in the Netherlands, France and the Republic of Ireland. By the middle of the decade, this capacity is expected to rise fivefold to 25GW through a string of projects including more subsea cables to France and Ireland as well as new connections with Norway, Denmark, Germany and Belgium. A more ambitious project has been proposed to connect Britain to Iceland via a 620-mile subsea cable, but progress on these plans has been slow. Mike Elmer, National Grid’s project director, said the Viking Link cable would play a vital role in the UK’s net zero carbon ambitions by increasing Britain’s access to “a cleaner, greener supply of electricity, which will make energy more secure and affordable”. The project also means less homegrown renewable energy will go to waste on days where there is more wind and solar power than the UK can use, because National Grid would export the extra electricity via the cable rather than call for wind and solar farms to be turned off. Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the project would “put Lincolnshire firmly at the heart of our economic recovery” and create jobs across the county. “It will also bolster our energy security, reduce bills for consumers, and give our homegrown renewable generators a greater chance to export zero-carbon electricity around the world,” the minister said."
"A shark routinely sold in Australian fish shops has been listed as critically endangered by an international conservation body, prompting environmentalists to call for stronger protection of the species. It comes as the government is due to release an interim report into Australia’s national environmental laws, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The school shark, whose meat is often sold as “flake” – the generic name for shark meat – was designated critically endangered last week by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In Australia, the species is listed in a special category known as “conservation dependent”, which allows otherwise endangered species to continue to be commercially traded. “It’s a quirk in our national laws that prioritises commercial exploitation and economic drivers over environmental ones,” said Leonardo Guida, a shark scientist and spokesman for the Australian Marine Conservation Society. “We stopped harvesting whales for that very reason. Why is it different for a shark? Why is it different for a fish? “There is no reason why any animal that has had a 90% decline in modern times should still continue to be harvested.” Guardian Australia has previously reported on the eight species, all marine animals, which are listed as conservation dependent despite qualifying for stronger protection under the act. The species include the blue warehou and the scalloped hammerhead, which the IUCN also lists as critically endangered. Under Australian laws, had the school shark been given the endangered listing it qualified for, it would be classified as a “no-take species”. The government has banned targeting of the school shark but, under its conservation-dependent listing, it can be legally caught as bycatch, which occurs predominantly in gummy shark fishing operations in Australia’s largest fishery, the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. School sharks are found globally in temperate waters, including off Australia, New Zealand, South America and South Africa. Since being officially declared overfished in 1990, the population of school shark in Australia has crashed to around 10% of its original numbers. Earlier this year, countries voted to list the school shark on the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) appendices – an international agreement that aims to build cooperation between countries for the conservation of migratory species. In a vote, Australia was the only country to oppose listing the shark under the convention. The environment department said the government had opposed the move because research indicated the population found in Australian waters “does not regularly migrate outside of Australian waters, and as such, does not meet the CMS definition of migratory”. A spokesman added that the process used by the IUCN to list the species as critically endangered differed to the process used under Australia’s EPBC Act. “A fundamental difference between the two processes is that the IUCN Red List assessment is a global assessment and may be influenced heavily by population declines outside Australian waters.” He added that stringent measures were in place for school shark populations under the conservation-dependent listing. But the threatened species scientific committee has told the review of Australia’s environment laws that the conservation-dependent category needs urgent reform and that it masks the actual conservation status of a species. The AMCS and other conservation groups have argued the category should be scrapped and species given the protection they qualify for. The chair of the review, the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, delivered his interim report to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, two weeks ago. Lawrence Chelbeck, a marine biologist with Humane Society International, said the IUCN listing should prompt the government to put forward the school shark for reassessment for stronger protection. He said species listed as conservation dependent had not shown the level of recovery that listing as a nationally protected species should deliver. “We suspect the value of the school shark as byproduct is the real reason for the government’s stance and not whether it’s migratory or not,” he said. “Endangered species should be protected from commercial exploitation regardless of value.”"
"A proposal by Victoria’s state-owned forestry agency to log forest burnt in the summer bushfires would affect habitat for more than 30 threatened species, according to analysis by The Wilderness Society. VicForests has proposed opening 59 new coupes in the state’s north-east and East Gippsland regions for so-called salvage logging of burnt native forests. Conservationists have opposed the plan and in a submission to public consultation on the proposal, The Wilderness Society (TWS) says its analysis found each of the 59 coupes contained habitat for threatened species, with 39 containing habitat for critically endangered species. The environment group is also urging companies that purchase VicForests timber to reject any logs from the new coupes, warning timber millers may be “subject to legal exposure” if harvesting of timber breached environmental laws. Under Australia’s Illegal Logging Prohibition Act, companies are not permitted to process timber that has been illegally logged. “The Wilderness Society generally does not believe that any VicForests harvested logs can be said to be ‘low risk’,” the organisation said in its letter, which was also submitted to VicForests. “However, as logs from these coupes will have a very clear and specific set of risks, based upon threatened species analysis and the recent federal court ruling, the risk of illegality for logs from these areas is potentially even higher.” Amelia Young, the national campaigns director for TWS, said the analysis found the proposed logging in the 59 coupes could affect habitat for 34 species, including the regent honeyeater, the spotted-tail quoll and the greater glider. The organisation used the federal government’s threatened species database and maps of the timber release plan to reach its conclusions. It argues that companies receiving VicForests timber should be applying greater scrutiny to the agency’s operations following a recent federal court judgment that found VicForests breached laws protecting threatened species. “What we have here is VicForests proposing to add a number of coupes to the timber release plan which the analysis shows is very likely to be habitat for animals like the greater glider and also heavily impacted by last summer’s bushfires,” Young said. “We hope that the mills, the processors of VicForest logs, more carefully scrutinise the wood being supplied to them and, as they’re legally required to, conduct due diligence.” The May federal court ruling found VicForests had breached the code of conduct in the regional forestry agreement for logging operations in Victoria’s central highlands. As a result of this, the court ruled the operations were not exempt from national environmental laws and that past and proposed logging would have a significant impact on the vulnerable greater glider and the critically endangered Leadbeater’s possum. Final orders have not yet been issued in the case and VicForests has said it plans to appeal. Earlier this month, Bunnings announced it would stop selling timber supplied by VicForests, in response to the federal court case. A spokesman for VicForests said the proposed 59 new coupes were “selected based on rigorous field and desk-based surveys”. “Any area confirmed for harvesting will be surveyed for endangered species prior to harvesting and areas within the coupes will be off-limits where they are found,” he said. He said the timber release plan was required to ensure “there is the necessary timber to keep supply chain businesses and hundreds of people in work”. The Victorian government announced a plan last year to phase out native forest logging by 2030. On Wednesday, the government said it would provide $4m to Forest and Wood Products Australia over four years for the establishment of a Gippsland centre of the National Institute for Forest Products Innovation. The centre is being established to help diversify the forestry sector as it transitions from native timber harvesting to plantation timber."
"The Irish government revoked approvals for the operator of two regular livestock carriers, the Atlantic M and the Express 1, last week, following questions from the Guardian and Irish farm animal welfare organisation Ethical Farming Ireland (EFI).  Internal emails appear to show that Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) was unaware that the performance ratings for the ships’ operator was below the required standard until a campaigner from EFI got in touch last year. Last week DAFM told the Guardian it had written to the “owner/operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1 regarding the department’s intention to revoke their approval … once the department became aware of the performance rating”. “The operator was given 14 days to make representations”, the email went on to say, before the “owners/operator’s approval was subsequently revoked”. Ireland’s exports of dairy, beef and livestock are a pillar of its agri-food sector. The latest figures from Bord Bia, the Irish food board, show agri-food products account for 10% of total exports. International sales of meat and livestock earned the country almost €4bn (£3.3bn) in 2019. Shipping is an opaque and complex area, however, all the more so when live animals are involved. In 2016, to complement EU law, Ireland introduced another layer of regulation on the carriage of livestock by sea. The regulations stipulate that the performance level of companies operating livestock vessels “must not be listed as ‘low or very low’ on the performance tables of Port State Control published by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)”. But the operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1, two ships that regularly carry livestock from Ireland, fell into EMSA’s “low or very low” bracket. The EMSA website and Panama-based shipping registration service, PMA Certification, show both vessels are operated by Turkish company Emiroglu Deniz Nakliyati. The list is updated daily and relates to the previous 36 months. The Guardian contacted DAFM to ask for more information about the situation. On 10 February the department replied, saying that it had revoked the operator’s approval for both ships. Questions about the future of both ships, or the approval of a new operator, were not answered. Emails seen by the Guardian indicate that the DAFM was previously unaware that the safety and compliance manager for the Atlantic M and Express 1 was on the EMSA’s “low or very low performance” list. The monitoring gap allowed livestock shipments to continue as normal in the preceding months. In the emails the management for the ships expressed surprise at the sudden approvals revocation in early 2020, given that the vessels had already “loaded from Ireland many [times]”, and each time the DAFM had inspected the vessels, “we get approval, so what happened now?” In an interview with the Guardian, the ships’ former safety management company, the Istanbul-based Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyatı, confirmed that the DAFM had revoked their approval in January this year because the company was on the EMSA’s low-performing list. Explaining the rating, Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyati’s operations manager Erhan Çavdar said this had followed the detainment of some of its ships. One of the detained ships was the Atlantic M. Caroline Rowley of EFI told the Guardian she had emailed the DAFM on 30 December, raising concerns about the Atlantic M and the Express 1. The same day, the DAFM raised those concerns with the ships’ management in an email marked “urgent”.  Earlier in December, Rowley had also notified the DAFM about problems with the operator of a third Irish livestock carrier, the Sarah M. At that point, the Sarah M was operated by the Beirut Shipping Company, whose performance was listed by EMSA as “low or very low”. The Sarah M is now operated by DMS lines, which is not on the low or very low listing. Despite Rowley’s emails, which the department acknowledged, the next Sarah M cattle shipment went ahead at the end of 2019. The Guardian tried to contact the Beirut Shipping Company, but was told by Farouk El Murr, who works for the Sarah M’s current operator, DMS Lines, based at the same address, that the Beirut Shipping Company had closed in “late December, early January”. El Murr said the closure had come “after its licence was revoked by the Irish DAFM because it was on the low or very low performing EMSA list”.  An Irish marine law expert, who has asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian that the Irish carriage of livestock regulations appeared to make no provision for monitoring any changes to an operator’s rating. Nor, the lawyer said, do they appear to require an operator to inform the DAFM if it is placed on the EMSA’s “low or very low performance” list after it has been approved. Responding to the lawyer’s comments, the DAFM said the “system for the approval of vessels for the carriage of livestock in Ireland involves a comprehensive inspection by a marine surveyor and by a departmental veterinarian to determine the suitability of the vessel for that particular purpose”. “In addition to that, the department requires the vessel to have a valid classification certificate issued by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. This is clearly not the sole requirement for approval.” Rowley fears that if she had not contacted the DAFM, “these vessels would still be operating in breach of regulations with the department being none the wiser.” She said there is a wider issue in the way that these regulations are being monitored and what seems to be a gap between what the agriculture department says and what it does. “The DAFM prides itself on its exceptionally high standards. But when we see vessels with operating companies that don’t meet the criteria, vessels transferred to new operators just a few weeks after we send emails, we have to wonder whether anyone really cares about those animals.” An internal document appears to justify some of her concerns about the DAFM prioritising appearances. Although undated, a slide from a DAFM presentation seen by the Guardian, titled “Changes for 2019”, says it expects animal exporters to “comply fully with legislative requirements and minimise opportunities for NGOs and the [European] Commission to criticise and complain about Ireland’s compliances”."
"The fossil-fuel industry has doubled its donations to the major parties in the past four years, new analysis suggests. A new Australian Conservation Foundation report examining last week’s dump of donations data suggests the coal, oil and gas industry gave $1.9m in 2018-19. That’s more than double the $894,336 it gave in 2015-16, the ACF says. The three biggest donors in 2018-19 were the oil and gas behemoth Woodside Petroleum, the coalminer Adani, and industry lobby group the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. Across the four years, the largest donors were Woodside ($1m), Santos Limited ($567,537), Chevron ($452,017), Mineral Resources ($373,650), Origin Energy ($360,047), and Bluescope ($337,655). The analysis excludes the massive $83.3m in donations made by Clive Palmer’s mining company, Mineralogy, to his United Australia party. The extractive sector was found to be overrepresented among large fossil-fuel donors. Six of the 10 top donors were extractors, and since 2015-16 the extractive sector had donated $3.3m, or about 60% of fossil-fuel donations, the analysis found. Labor and the Coalition took roughly the same amount from the industry over the four years, other than 2017-18 when donations to the Coalition far outstripped Labor. Donations to the Coalition were only slightly higher than to Labor during the 2018-19 election year. Fossil-fuel money has also been pumped into associated entities, groups that are aligned to the major parties. The Minerals Council of Australia gave money to Liberal and Nationals-aligned entities such as the Australian Business Network, Enterprise Victoria, John McEwen House and Platinum Circle, and Labor entities such as Progressive Business, the federal Labor business forum, federal Labor business exchange, and the Hunter federal campaign. Jolene Elberth, a campaigner with ACF, said the report showed the sector was attempting to “buy political power” through donations. “As more Australians demand action on climate change and the pressure builds on politicians to take the problem seriously, the fossil-fuel industry is doubling down by spending more money to influence public policy,” she said. It is impossible to tell whether the donations declared by both parties represent the true extent of fossil-fuel political financing. Australia’s electoral laws require donations to be declared only if they are above $14,000. Donations can be split into multiple payments below $14,000 and still remain hidden, even if they total more than the threshold. That allows a large proportion of financing to remain hidden from the public. The Centre for Public Integrity and the ACF both estimate the amount of unsourced money – known as dark money – at $100m in 2018-19. “This paper shows that both major parties are dependent on donations from the fossil-fuel lobby,” the ACF report concluded. “Not only this, but our major parties and their fundraising entities are responsible for a large sum of dark money in our system. “With poor requirements for reporting donations, there is little transparency to hold donors and parties to account.” The federal donations system has remained weak even as state governments have progressed towards transparency. NSW, Victoria and Queensland require donations above $1,000 to be disclosed. The donations are reported to the public in near real-time. But federally, donations are disclosed only once a year, in February, making it impossible for the public to understand donors’ attempts to influence politics at any single point."
"Two scientific studies of the number of insects splattered by cars have revealed a huge decline in abundance at European sites in two decades. The research adds to growing evidence of what some scientists have called an “insect apocalypse”, which is threatening a collapse in the natural world that sustains humans and all life on Earth. A third study shows plummeting numbers of aquatic insects in streams. The survey of insects hitting car windscreens in rural Denmark used data collected every summer from 1997 to 2017 and found an 80% decline in abundance. It also found a parallel decline in the number of swallows and martins, birds that live on insects. The second survey, in the UK county of Kent in 2019, examined splats in a grid placed over car registration plates, known as a “splatometer”. This revealed 50% fewer impacts than in 2004. The research included vintage cars up to 70 years old to see if their less aerodynamic shape meant they killed more bugs, but it found that modern cars actually hit slightly more insects. “This difference we found is critically important, because it mirrors the patterns of decline which are being reported widely elsewhere, and insects are absolutely fundamental to food webs and the existence of life on Earth,” said Paul Tinsley-Marshall from Kent Wildlife Trust. “It’s pretty horrendous.” “Most naturalists who are out in nature have seen this coming over a long time,” said Anders Pape Møllerfrom the Paris-Sud University in France, who has been visiting the Danish study area for 50 years. “My colleagues remember going on summer holidays as children and their parents had to stop their car to clean the windscreen so they could continue. This is certainly not a problem any more.” Insect population collapses have been reported in Germany and Puerto Rico, and the first global scientific review, published in February 2019, said widespread declines threatened to cause a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”. Insects pollinate three-quarters of crops and another recent study showed widespread losses of such insects across Britain. The causes of decline are the destruction of natural habitat, pesticides and the impacts of the climate crisis. Light pollution has also been cited as a key “bringer of insect apocalypse”. The survey in Kent analysed nearly 700 car journeys reported by volunteers from June to August 2019. The bug splats on the registration plate were counted to calculate the number of impacts per kilometre. This was 50% lower than an RSPB survey using the same methodology found in 2004. “The most surprising thing was how rarely we actually found anything on the plate at all,” said Tinsley-Marshall. This was despite the data showing that modern cars hit more bugs, perhaps because older models push a bigger layer of air – and insects – over the vehicle. The Danish research, published in the journal Ecology and Evolution, used data from an average of 65 car journeys a year on the same stretch of road and at the same speed between 1997 and 2017. Møller took account of the time of day, temperature, wind speed and date of the journey and found an 80% decline in insect abundance over the 21-year period. Checks using insect nets and sticky traps showed the same trend. Møller said the causes were likely to be “a bit of everything”, but noted significant changes due to global heating. “In my 50 years, the temperature in April, May and June has increased by 1.5C [2.7F] on average in my study area,” he said. “The amount of rain has increased by 50%. We are talking about dramatic differences.” The stream research, published in the journal Conservation Biology, analysed weekly data from 1969 to 2010 on a stream in a German nature reserve, where the only major human impact is climate change. “Overall, water temperature increased by 1.88C and discharge patterns changed significantly. These changes were accompanied by an 81.6% decline in insect abundance,” the scientists reported. “Our results indicate that climate change has already altered [wildlife] communities severely, even in protected areas.” Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of the charity Buglife, said: “These new studies reinforce our understanding of the dangerously rapid disappearance of insect life in both the air and water. It is becoming clear that the four horsemen of the insect apocalypse are climate change, habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and pollution. It is essential we create more joined up space for insects that is safe from pesticides, climate change and other harm.” Most scientific research to date has shown serious declines in the number of insects in the places studied. “There is no doubt about this,” said Møller. “What there is slight doubt about is the extent to which this occurs across geographical and temporal scales.” Long-term studies are rare and mostly from Europe and North America, with a few ranging from Australia to China and Brazil to South Africa, but hardly any elsewhere. There has also been discussion about the best methodologies among researchers. “But that is not the main point,” said Tinsley-Marshall. “I think it’s pretty clear that something pretty catastrophic is going on.” Kent Wildlife Trust is now working on a smartphone app to make it easier for volunteers to provide insect splat data."
"California began regulating surface water in rivers and streams in 1914, but it took the state another 100 years to look underground. In 2014, for the first time in its history, California passed a law regulating the use of groundwater – the resource on which 85% of its population and much of its $50bn agriculture industry rely. This year marks the first big deadline for the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Sgma), as dozens of agencies complete initial plans to protect overdrafted water resources. Here’s what you need to know: California’s underground basins are a key component of the state’s complex and fragile water system. For all of the state’s history, the rights to groundwater had come with land ownership: if one had an access point to an aquifer, one had the right to drill into it and pump out its contents. No regulatory entity would track, let alone limit how much water any pump sent up. This anarchy persisted for decades. Aquifers were drained lower and lower and the land above them sank – a phenomenon called “subsidence” that wreaks havoc on infrastructure and compresses the soil, making it even more difficult for some aquifers to recharge with water. Pumping reached a fever pitch during the drought that began in 2011, when growers across California received less and less water from the rivers and canals meted out by regulatory agencies and irrigation districts. To make up the difference, farmers who could afford it drilled new wells and lowered existing ones. Aquifers became increasingly overdrawn as more and more water was pumped out without being replaced by rainfall. As the drought continued for the next six years, smaller farmers and domestic water users with more shallow personal wells found the groundwater had retreated past their pumps, many of which now sent up only sand. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act or Sgma (pronounced “sigma”) aimed to address this seemingly sudden crisis, which in reality was over a century in the making. The package of three bills was passed over vocal criticism from some local governments in the Central Valley – California’s agricultural heartland – agribusiness and the California Farm Bureau Federation, which warned of “huge long-term economic impacts”. Sgma essentially upholds the right to groundwater access and use, but considers water to be a shared asset and imposes rules on its use. Those restrictions also apply to California’s powerful agriculture industry, which uses roughly 80% of all the state’s water. Sgma relies on local oversight. The law established local groundwater sustainability agencies to oversee the development and implementation of plans to manage groundwater resources in California’s 450 underground basins. The first round included more than 260 agencies for more than 140 of the state’s most high-priority basins, 21 of which are “critically overdrafted”. Of those, 11 are in the San Joaquin Valley. Those agencies are tasked with developing and overseeing groundwater sustainability plans, with the power to gather data on how much water is being pumped and where and set limits on it. Analysts have estimated that between those limits on groundwater pumping and less available water due to climate change, anywhere between 500,000 and 1m acres of California farmland will have to be fallowed. Many of the groundwater sustainability agencies in the Central Valley share their borders and board members with the local irrigation districts, reflecting agriculture’s interests. But these agencies and plans must “consider the interests of” beneficial users, including groundwater rights holders and disadvantaged communities served by private wells and small community water systems. Those communities won’t face pumping limits like their farming neighbors under Sgma, but they will face impacts nonetheless. Some of the sustainability plans call for allowing aquifers to drain to the worst levels seen during the drought before pumping limits would be imposed – levels that left many residents without any water at all. Although Sgma was passed in 2014, agencies in particularly high-priority, overdrafted basins had until 31 January 2020 to file their plans to make groundwater resources sustainable by 2040. Those plans are subject to review and approval by the state’s department of water resources, and will be reassessed every five years. That doesn’t mean the sustainability process will begin right away. Instead of imposing immediate limits on new wells and water pumping, the plans will “glide” toward sustainability in 2040. A framework for healthy groundwater resources and storage is key to California’s ability to weather the more extreme drought and flood cycles the state will experience due to climate change. With less water stored in the form of snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains, there will be less surface water to meet agricultural demand – putting yet more pressure on overdrafted aquifers. Sgma was widely hailed as a necessary and long-overdue regulatory step toward making California’s water usage remotely sustainable. But it will also have significant impacts on the state’s agriculture industry, rural communities and endangered wetlands. Over the last near-decade of drought and recovery, California has tried to plan for a drier future. Just weeks after the state passed Sgma in 2014, voters approved a $7.5bn water bond to pay for water infrastructure upgrades for storage, ecosystem protection and drinking water. It was not enough. More than 1 million state residents live with water too toxic to drink. In 2019, the state passed the Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, which allocates $1.4bn over 11 years to projects and programs to bring clean water to disadvantaged communities statewide. This January, Gavin Newsom, the California governor, released his Water Resilience Portfolio, “a comprehensive strategy to build a climate-resilient water system”. “California’s water challenges are daunting, from severely depleted groundwater basins to vulnerable infrastructure to unsafe drinking water in far too many communities. Climate change magnifies the risks,” Newsom said in announcing the plan."
"The light was dazzling on Totley Moss, turning the myriad pools of standing water to quicksilver. But the afternoon sun was haloed with dark clouds and by the time I dropped off White Edge, sheets of stinging hail were driving across the moor. I sank gratefully into the magical embrace of Hay Wood, thick with its sheltering oaks and gentle mosses, to wait for the gale to pass. Almost at once I spotted what I took to be a gigantic whitish dog, no more than 30 metres away, lurking in the trees. My heart took off, even if my feet didn’t. Then I reprocessed the data correctly to come up with a red deer hind, blanketed in hail, her damp black nose twitching in alarm. To my left I noticed a handful more hinds, which banked away into the gloom, while the one that had startled me darted off in the opposite direction. Moments later, the sun was back, spearing through the twisted branches. Whatever hail had made it through the trees began dissolving into the wet ground beneath. Snatches of birdsong resumed: mostly tits, the cronk of a raven somewhere above Froggatt Edge, behind me the screech of a jay. I turned quickly – but too late. Jays are a rich presence in my life, partly for their vocalisations. Their mimicry is famous: they do a brilliant tawny owl. But it’s their family chat I appreciate most; the soft exchange between individuals, the gentle clicks and hoots, the ties that bind. Their colouration is another obsession, in particular the electric blue of their coverts, once plundered by milliners, still beloved of fly-fishers. I usually have one pinned above my desk. The brilliance of this colour has nothing to do with any sort of pigment. It’s a consequence of the nanostructure of their feathers, made from spongy keratin, like our fingernails and hair. By varying the size of microscopic holes in their surface, jays alter the way light hitting them is scattered and reflected, creating the rich bands of white, blue and indigo that are the hallmark of these light-tricksters. This effect extends into the ultraviolet spectrum, another of nature’s hidden thresholds the human mind cannot cross."
"It should have died. At the end of a line of common reeds, an ancient willow pollard was anchored at the stream side. Its trunk was as broad round its middle as 10 of me. Two summers before, an arsonist had set light to a flytipper’s heap at the tree’s base. That should have been the flaming coup de grâce for a veteran that had long since gone into terminal decline. Decades earlier, it had opened its heart to the world, having shed the bark armour all the way round its circumference from five to nine o’clock, exposing its core. The fire left a charred, blackened face. I leaned forward, expecting a sooty smell, for even Victorian fireplaces still reek of their last blaze. Instead, I inhaled a scent of intermingled peat and ginger. Where the fire had not scorched its bleached centre, the wood was hard but brittle. Pieces had broken off. I picked up one the size of a golf ball and it weighed less than nothing. The tree’s last big show of growth had produced three thick trunks sprouting from its crown. The tree’s final cut had reduced one to an empty fisheye socket, until even its rim rotted away, and tufts of grass filled the crevices. Ivy had snaked up the back of the tree to join it, green on green. The other two trunks had been lopped off to stumps a metre high, presenting a V-sign to the sky. Out of their gnarly sides a dozen thick sprays of twigs had spurted forth. They were greenish yellow, shiny and slippery like nylon washing-line. My wife grasped at a bundle of stems, running her basket-weaving fingers down their length, feeling for springy suppleness. “You could work these,” she said. February had woken the youthful sprigs. One spray showed the merest bumps of buds. On the lowest spray, two precocious twigs, partly touching each other, had already unfurled their lanceolate leaves. Each slender leaf was no longer or wider than a matchstick. Such tiny expressions of vitality. This “dead” hulk was still sending out fingers of life, the thin chlorophyll-packed flaps that said: no, not yet. That old tree might still outlive us all. "
"UK taxpayer funds totalling $750m (£577m) have been invested in new fossil fuel projects in developing African countries despite the government’s public commitment to tackling the climate crisis, according to an international watchdog. Global Witness found that a London-based investment group raised $1bn from the UK government over 16 years and spent three-quarters of this supporting oil and gas projects in some of Africa’s poorest countries. The Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), which relies on the UK taxpayer for two-thirds of its funding, committed $750m to fossil fuel projects between 2002 and 2018, including recent investments in heavy fuel oil power plants in Senegal and Mali. Since then, the group’s investments have included $24m for a gas plant in Togo and $31m for a gas plant expansion project in Ivory Coast. Adam McGibbon, a campaigner at Global Witness, said “not a penny of public money” should be used on fossil fuel infrastructure. “The British public will quite rightly be appalled to know that their tax money is being used to finance some of the world’s dirtiest fossil fuels, ultimately contributing to climate change,” he said. “It flies in the face of claims by the UK government, ahead of hosting a major UN climate summit this year, that the UK is a global leader in fighting climate change.” The report is likely to reignite concerns that UK international aid designed to help support infrastructure in developing countries is instead increasing reliance of those states on oil and gas. Last year the government was taken to task by the environmental audit committee for sending billions of pounds overseas to help build fossil fuel power plants while claiming a climate victory on home soil. Global Witness said the government should immediately end all fossil fuel investments and commit to using UK taxpayer money solely to fund clean energy. A spokeswoman for the PIDG said the fund was “acutely aware that infrastructure development has the potential to lock in future carbon emissions patterns” and that the countries it invested in were “the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change”. The fund has said it would prioritise renewable energy projects in its investment plans, and had already invested a total of $711m in renewable energy infrastructure in recent years. It has also banned investments in coal, to align with global commitments made through the Paris agreement on climate change. But the investor would continue to use UK taxpayer funds to support oil and gas infrastructure in countries where the need for electricity is urgent, the spokeswoman added. The Global Witness report says: “It is difficult to see how supporting further fossil fuel projects is in any way in line with Paris agreement commitments. Fossil fuels hinder, rather than help, development … there is no longer any justification for supporting fossil fuel power generation with aid.” A Department for International Development spokesman said: “We know developing countries rely on energy from a range of sources and the UK can help them move towards clean energy. UK aid support to PIDG is helping achieve this, prioritising investments which mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change in developing countries, and help them adapt.”  The UK’s commitment to supporting oil and gas projects in Africa was at the heart of the UK-Africa investment summit last month. Boris Johnson told delegates “not another penny of UK taxpayers’ money” would be invested in coal, adding that UK companies should help African countries “extract and use oil and gas in the cleanest, greenest way possible”. The Guardian revealed that more than 90% of the £2bn in energy deals struck at the inaugural UK-Africa summit last month were for fossil fuels, despite the government’s commitment to “support African countries in their transition to cleaner energy”."
"A huge security operation is being put in place in Bristol for a visit by Greta Thunberg that is expected to attract a crowd of around 25,000, most of them children and young people. Police and Bristol council officials said there would be significant disruption for the youth climate strike on Friday and warned that they could not be responsible for the care of unsupervised children. The Guardian heard from children and adults across the country, as far afield as Scotland, who have said they will be attending. Special coaches are being arranged from London, Cardiff, Exeter, Oxford and Birmingham, and rail and bus stations are gearing up for a huge influx of youngsters keen to take part in the strike and hear Thunberg speak. At least one Bristol school is expected to close and the numbers will be swollen by thousands of students from the city’s universities and colleges. Police advised people to think carefully before coming into Bristol if they are not taking part in the strike. Youth striker Kai Damani, 18, a sixth form student, anticipated that up to 30,000 people could attend. Thunberg is due to make a speech on College Green outside city hall before joining a march around the city. She may also visit a mural of herself in the Bedminster area of Bristol. Damani said the movement was working closely with the police and the city council and would provide its own stewards and wellbeing officers to help. He also said that the risk from coronavirus had been considered but it had not received advice from the authorities to call the strike off. Bristol city council’s executive director, Mike Jackson, and Supt Andy Bennett, the city’s police area commander, issued a joint statement in which they said they were working to manage public safety and minimise disruption. But they said: “We know there will be major disruption to the city. We have seen a number of protests over the last year. However, this one will be significantly larger. “We want to ensure that anyone planning to attend is prepared and able to make their own safety and safeguarding arrangements. Parents are responsible for their children. The council and police are not responsible for unsupervised children. “The event has grown so large that the usual controls, stewarding and safety measures that are routinely put in place by the teenage Youth Strike 4 Climate organisers may not be adequate, especially for primary school children and people with disabilities. “We would encourage those attending, or who are responsible for children who wish to attend, to consider their arrangements carefully and make their own informed decisions. Please do not underestimate the scale of this protest. “We’re working to ensure Bristol is open as usual, but would urge people to allow extra time for travel and consider whether their journey is necessary.” Johnny Palmer, founder and managing director of the Bristol company SolCell, which will be providing green energy for the sound system, said his eight-year-old son, Wilfred, would be helping him for the day rather than going to school. “For him, it’s a way of taking positive action rather than suffering from climate change anxiety,” he said. Ishmael, a 13-year-old from Bristol who is attending, said Thunberg’s visit might inspire those who do not usually attend to turn out: “Lots of us are regular protesters. However, I think this might help others feel like pulling their sleeves up and joining in.” Willow, a 15-year-old from Gloucestershire, and some of her friends were planning to head to Bristol. She said: “It shows that it takes one person to stand up to something which is not right, and many, many people will stand with them. It shows that time is running out and we are in serious need of change. And it shows that young people should not be underestimated – we have a voice and we are strong.” A father said his six-year-old wanted to attend. He added: “I might take our 20-month-old too but it depends on his nap.” Bristol Green party councillor Carla Denyer said: “I fully support the children in taking part in this strike. I have been helping the organisers with some logistics and will be there in person on Friday. Of course education is important, but so is ensuring they have a healthy environment to grow up in. “Greta Thunberg and the millions of climate strikers she inspired have played such a crucial role in forcing climate change up the agenda and ensuring that politicians and other leaders cannot be seen to be ignoring the issue.”"
"Environmental campaigners have issued a legal case against the government to try to halt the release of more than 50m non-native game birds this summer, saying the birds could damage Britain’s most important wildlife sites. Wild Justice, a campaign group led by the environmentalists Chris Packham, Mark Avery and Ruth Tingay, said the annual release of 47m pheasants and 10m red-legged partridges was “unlawful” without a proper assessment of the ecological impacts the animals have on protected areas. At their peak, these birds, mainly imported from France, Belgium, Spain and Poland, represent half of the UK’s total bird biomass. Wild Justice lawyers have asked for a judicial review because they believe the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) could be in breach of the EU habitats directive by allowing the release of these birds in the countryside. Although game birds are not allowed to be directly released at Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), they are allowed to be released nearby. Wild Justice believes this indirectly affects rare and protected wildlife. Defra has three weeks from 24 February to file papers with the court. Then a judge will decide whether this issue should go to court and how long it should take. Avery said: “Pheasants go wherever they want. They turn up on nature reserves where they’ve never been released … This is a very serious ecological assault on the countryside which government is failing to assess and regulate.” Only 30% of recreational game birds are shot, killed and retrieved. The others die of other causes and provide winter food for scavengers such as foxes, carrion crows and rats, whose populations remain artificially high as a result. Conservationists are concerned that these scavengers will eat more vulnerable species such as curlews and lapwings nesting at nearby nature sites. Avery said: “These non-native game birds go around gobbling up insects, other invertebrates and even snakes and lizards, they peck at vegetation, their droppings fertilise sensitive habitats which no farmer would be allowed to fertilise, and they provide prey and carrion that swell the populations of predators that then go on to prey on other threatened species.” Tingay described the lack of regulation on released game birds as staggering. “The government doesn’t seem to know or care how many are released each year and even the figure of 60m game birds may well be an underestimate.” Defra has previously acknowledged that the release of game birds might require assessment and has pledged to review the way it measures the birds’ impact. It said it would not carry out an assessment this year as it was neither “reasonable nor realistic to expect measures to be taken before summer/autumn 2020”. Lawyers for Wild Justice are calling for immediate action, however. Packham said: “Defra has been dragging its feet on this issue since we first raised it. It is time to sort this out and Wild Justice is fully prepared for a court battle on behalf of UK wildlife.” Defra declined to comment on the latest legal action, but said it was reviewing the number of game birds released and their impact on protected sites. Alexander Lees, a senior lecturer in biodiversity working at Manchester Metropolitan University, said it was important to interrogate the ecological impacts of releasing large numbers of non-native birds. However, he said game management could benefit wildlife.  Lees said: “The rapid rise in the number of pheasants and red-legged partridges released follows the collapse of populations of native lowland game birds like grey partridges – species decimated by agricultural intensification and habitat loss. If shooting interests can refocus on recovering populations of our native game species through habitat restoration … then they would find many more allies among conservationists.”  Until December, the UK government has to abide by the EU’s habitat directive. “We are afraid that some of this protection will be diminished in the future [when the UK’s Brexit transition period ends],” he said. The conservationists’ legal action follows a successful challenge made by the campaign group last year to get the government to reassess the “general licences” system that allowed people to shoot “pest species” of birds. Their legal action led to the introduction of more restrictive temporary licences."
"British farmers are not often called hysterical. For Boris Johnson to dismiss their concerns over food imports post-Brexit seems to show he is willing to see an influx of cheap, low-quality food that British farmers will not be able to compete with. That would hasten the decline of family-run farms, and open up the countryside further to the sort of “megafarms” common in the US. Cheap food sounds good, but Johnson has glossed over the dangers. Chlorine-washing chicken is partly an issue of animal welfare – poultry in the US are kept in filthy conditions that would be illegal here, then the carcasses are dipped in bleach. But it is one of food safety too, contrary to Johnson’s claims. If the UK’s food standards are to be science-based, as he claims, they will have to account for science that shows the washing of chicken in chlorine only masks the presence of pathogens, rather than eliminating them. That leaves the harmful germs able to carry on infecting humans after the bleach treatment. Johnson’s scientists will also have to explain why serious food poisoning is a greater problem in the US than the UK. For instance, the US reports about 420 deaths each year from salmonella, while Public Health England found none in its most recent labs data. “We would like some clarity from the prime minister about how exactly he intends to keep the UK population safe from food imported from countries with lower standards than our own,” said Kath Dalmeny, the chief executive of Sustain, the food and farming alliance. Then there are the indirect impacts on human health, arguably much more alarming than food poisoning. Though the coronavirus may have come from wild animals, others such as swine flu and bird flu were associated with intensive livestock rearing. Intensive farming also requires huge inputs of antibiotics, which are leading to the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant superbugs of the kind that may soon make even routine operations life-threatening. Let the prime minister examine the science of intensive farming and food production: he will find little mumbo-jumbo and a lot to be worried about."
"I usually hear these birds before I see them: a series of soft, liquid whistles, floating up from the narrow, steep-sided waterways that crisscross the moor behind my home. The sounds come from a flock of our smallest duck, the teal. The collective noun for teal is “spring”, and they do always seem to be spring-loaded and ready to fly. No matter how carefully my dog and I sneak past, they usually notice us, taking to the air in a flurry, before dropping down in the distance, well out of sight. To get closer to this delicate little duck, I headed south to the RSPB reserve at Greylake in Somerset. Once inside the roomy hide, I set up my scope and took a proper look. The drake teal’s plumage is far more subtle and complex than it first appears. Black wiggles across his breast, known as “vermiculations”, from the Latin for worm; a creamy-yellow slash along his flanks; and the bluish-green eyepatch: teal being the only colour believed to be named after a British bird. He was resting on one leg, opening and shutting pale eyelids, as the rain splashed off his plumage like water off a waxed jacket. The prettiest of all our ducks? Wigeon, pintail and garganey might dispute that, but on a damp, overcast day, this little bird is hard to beat."

"Owners of large grouse moors threatened to take legal action against government ministers who had started developing plans to ban repeated heather burning, Whitehall documents have disclosed. The landowners issued the threat after ministers started working on producing a law to ban them from carrying out the environmentally damaging practice on their moorland estates. The old heather is burned to expose new shoots – a source of food for grouse, whose numbers are boosted. The estates then charge people who want to shoot grouse. They said they were upset with the way the government was consulting with them and others who would be affected by the proposed ban. The government started to draw up a compulsory ban after unsuccessfully attempting to persuade the landowners to end the practice voluntarily. Green campaigners have been calling for an end to the practice as they argue it harms the environment and wildlife by releasing climate-changing gases into the atmosphere, worsening flooding and degrading a precious habitat. They criticised the landowners for threatening legal action. Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner with the Friends of the Earth group, said: “Why are a small elite of landowners still allowed to get away with these damaging slash-and-burn practices, and throwing their weight around in this way?” The documents, which relate to meetings between the government and the Moorland Association, a lobbying body which represents landowners controlling a million acres of upland moorland in England, have been released to Friends of the Earth under the Freedom of Information Act. Last summer the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the Moorland Association that it was beginning to develop legislation to ban the rotational burning of heather on peatland known as blanket bog. Defra officials said they had started a consultation to gather evidence to evaluate how the proposed ban would affect the owners of grouse moor estates and others. On 21 August Nick Downshire, the association’s chairman, wrote to Defra to say that the landowners were “alarmed” at the “shortcomings” of the consultation and wanted it to be widened and reissued. He said a meeting the association had with Defra three weeks earlier appeared to be “something in the manner of a box-ticking exercise, rather than genuine engagement”. “It also exposes Defra to further legal challenge in respect of the validity and lawfulness of the consultation as a whole – a challenge the association would take forward if … members’ concerns and feedback are not taken into account as this process unfolds”. He outlined a series of steps that Defra needed to implement to take into account the views of the landowners and others when the government formulated the proposed ban. “Each of these steps is, in our view, imperative to guard against the impression, or indeed the reality, that Defra’s commitment to the consultation process is half-hearted or legally inadequate. A failure to take any of these steps will require the association to consider legal intervention”. He said the landowners and others should be given more time to respond to the consultation. On 30 August, a Defra official told the association that the consultation would not be reissued with its suggested changes, although the deadline would be extended for a short period. Defra says it intends to ban the burning of heather and will publish its plans shortly. When questioned about its intentions last month, Zac Goldsmith, a junior environment minister, said “one way or another this needs to stop”. According to the documents, the government decided, in 2017, to give the landowners two years to voluntarily stop the practice before deciding whether a ban was needed. Amanda Anderson, the Moorland Association’s director, said: “Our members had very serious concerns over the structure of the consultation, which we raised with Defra. “In particular, we were deeply worried, and still are, about the potential environmental and conservation consequences of land being left without sustainable management alternatives. “Since then, we have had continued to have constructive discussions with Defra and Natural England over how best to find a mutually workable solution that will help achieve the shared goal of deep peat restoration.”"
"Boris Johnson has been accused of hampering the recovery effort from the worst winter storms in a generation as flooded towns were evacuated and parts of Wales were braced for more downpours. MPs and council leaders in flood-stricken areas said the government’s refusal to call an emergency Cobra meeting had obstructed the response in some towns and delayed the release of vital funds to recover from Storms Ciara and Dennis. Holly Lynch, the Labour MP for Halifax, said that more than 1,000 homes, businesses and schools had been damaged by the hurricane-force winds and flooding last week yet there had been no support from government beyond the Bellwin scheme, which reimburses some of the costs faced by local authorities. She said the lack of action from Johnson’s government was in contrast to the funds made available immediately after the Christmas 2015 floods, which prompted a Cobra meeting within 24 hours. “A lot of that funding [in 2015] was unlocked so quickly because there was a Cobra meeting, which pulled all the different government departments together. This time, none of that support at all has been forthcoming,” she said. “His refusal to call a Cobra meeting has really hampered the recovery of lots of different communities up and down the country, not least of all mine.” As Downing Street came under pressure to act, the government announced measures late on Tuesday to help flood victims. They included an invitation to apply for up to £500 in “financial hardship payments”, council tax and business rates relief and access to funds of up to £2,500 to cover some uninsurable losses. Ministers also said flood-hit homes and businesses would be able to apply for up to £5,000 to “help make them more resilient to future flooding”, while a cross-Whitehall flood recovery taskforce was due to begin meeting this week. More than 300 flood warnings and alerts remain in place across Britain, including eight warning of danger to life in England and south Wales, as Johnson faced a second day of political pressure over his response to the storms. Evacuations were under way along the River Severn in Shropshire and 33 people were rescued from a care home in Herefordshire as rainfall from Storm Dennis continued to cause widespread damage and disruption. One of the severe flood warnings centred on the historic town of Ironbridge, near Telford in Shropshire, where residents were being evacuated over concerns that the swollen river would soon top a 6.8-metre temporary flood barrier on Tuesday night. Shaun Davies, the Labour leader of Telford & Wrekin council, said his local authority was having to carry out tasks usually organised by the Environment Agency – such as distributing sandbags and erecting flood barriers – because the agency was so stretched. He said: “What would be really helpful is if government were able to show some national leadership on this issue. What we need from the centre is some very practical support. It sounds very basic but sandbags and access to sand – there’s been no central resource that we have been made aware of so we are securing that but at a great premium.” Six people are thought to have died in the flooding. The sixth was named on Monday night as Yvonne Booth, 55, from Birmingham, who was swept into flood water near Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire on Sunday. Her family said they were devastated and appreciated the continued support from the emergency services. Downing Street said on Monday that Johnson had no plans to visit any of the areas affected by flooding from Storm Dennis, and would instead spend the day working from a country house in Kent. A No 10 spokesman said he was being kept updated from Chevening, a government-owned historic property near Sevenoaks being used while work is continuing at Chequers, the official prime ministerial country retreat. The new environment secretary, George Eustice, has defended the government’s response to the storms, insisting it has a “firm grip” and that flood defences were “working as intended”. In the past year, he said, new flood-response infrastructure had protected more than 200,000 properties, with a further 100,000 due to be protected. The government had also pledged an extra £4bn in funding for flood defences over the next five years, said Eustice. Thirty-three people were evacuated from a care home in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, as the River Wye reached its highest level since 1795, according to the county council leader, David Hitchiner. The council’s Conservative group leader, Jonathan Lester, said he did not believe sending ministers to flood-stricken areas was particularly important but said central government could do more to direct a “joined-up” approach between the various agencies on the ground. “I think after the floods have subsided and the lessons have been learned, more needs to be done in having this strategic approach and direction as to how best local authorities and agencies cope with this situation going forward,” he said. “I would welcome a strategy from government.”"
"Nikiko Masumoto began her farming career in the summer of 2011, just as California was entering its worst drought in recorded history. Masumoto is the fourth generation of her family to farm this land in Del Rey: 80 organic acres of stone fruit in eastern Fresno county in California’s fertile Central Valley, its most perfect peaches bound for the epicurean Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley. For four years in a row, the farm survived only on the water it could draw from underground. And as the drought persisted, the perfect peaches grew less perfect – smaller, malnourished. The farm lowered its wells and pumped more so Masumoto could keep the trees alive. The farm made it through by way of grit and preparation. But even with plenty of both, said Masumoto, “surviving is a real question.” At 34, Masumoto is roughly half the age of the average farmer. Where her neighbors are pondering retirement, she is thinking about how climate change and dwindling underground water reserves are going to affect the rest of her life, and her family’s legacy. “I’m at the beginning of my career. I hope to be farming for another 40, 50 years,” she said. “I think there’s going to be another catastrophic drought. What are we going to do?” The Central Valley is America’s fruit bowl, and the heart of California’s $50bn agriculture industry. But the 2011-2017 drought raised serious questions about the future of that industry and forced the state to grapple with regulating the one thing fueling much of it: groundwater. Rights to California’s uniquely unregulated groundwater have always come along with ownership of the land above. Groundwater allowed farmers to make it through dry times and to plant in parched places far from natural rivers or government canals. No entity would reliably track how much water any pump sent up, let alone prevent that pumping, even as the ground sank and thousands of residential wells ran dry. Hoping to bring overtaxed groundwater basins back into balance, the California legislature passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Sgma) in 2014 to begin regulating groundwater for the first time in the state’s history. The law, which created management agencies and set a 2040 deadline for sustainability, stands to reshape California agriculture and the Central Valley’s way of life. The Public Policy Institute of California estimated between 500,000 and 780,000 acres would have to be fallowed in order for the state’s natural aquifers to come back into balance. But the journey to sustainability will be a slow one, as the region glides toward the deadline – and as climate change further withers the state. Farmers with means plan for survival by seeking other water rights or planting more water-intensive but high-priced crops. Those without may be faced with fallowing their fields or getting out of the growing game altogether. The pumping won’t stop yet, but surviving is a real question. Some of the long banners and signs mounted beside the highways that run through the center of California have been there for years: “Save California’s Water”, “Dam Water Grows Food”, “Pray for Rain”. They are emotional totems and rallying cries for an agricultural system built on the engineering and re-engineering of the state’s water geology above and below the ground. All of that water – roughly 80% of the water California has – built an industry on which America relies to eat, producing two-thirds of the nation’s fruits and nuts and more than one-third of its vegetables. For over a century, farmers have drilled deeper and deeper to get the water they need for their thirsty and thirstier crops. As the years wore on, the ground sank and compressed below them, making it impossible for some aquifers to ever recharge. The drought that struck the valley in 2011 only accelerated the crisis. Without the benefit of surface water, farmers applied for record numbers of new well permits. “The really big growers were drilling these really big wells like crazy, and often neighboring farms were drying up,” said Dave Runsten, policy director at the California Alliance for Family Farmers. “In a situation like this, the people with the shortest straws lose.” The state passed Sgma in the midst of this madness. The law tasked local authorities with forming new agencies to manage their own abused aquifers by monitoring and measuring the water table and preparing plans to recharge the aquifers and capture and store more water wherever possible by 2040. The first Sgma plans for California’s most abused aquifers were due on 31 January – nearly six years after the law first passed. They largely focus on increasing water supplies, not limiting demand, as agencies scrounge for every drop. With deadlines decades away, the majority of plans reflect little sense of urgency to stop the underground extraction now. “My expectation is there’s probably going to be more optimism about the ability to augment supplies than might be borne out in reality,” said Ellen Hanak, vice-president and director of the Public Policy Institute of California Water Policy Center. The water table is expected to continue to sink, as farmers are expected to continue to pump – at least, if they can. It is unlikely that the Central Valley will see the pain of Sgma shared equally. The cost of sustainability appears set to hit the valley’s most modest players first. There are roughly 8,000 small farms between Fresno and Tulare counties alone, according to the 2012 agricultural census, many of them farmed by immigrants. Ruth Dahlquist-Willard, small farms adviser with the University of California Fresno Extension, worries about how those small farms will fare over the next 20 years, as the water table continues to drop. For farms that can’t rely on surface water, local Sgma plans in their current form could mean the difference between making it another season or selling the farm. The growers with the short straws will continue to lose. The plans set both goals and failure points for groundwater depth. In an analysis of the Central Kings groundwater sustainability plan in Fresno, UC Davis researcher Darcy Bostic found 20 agricultural wells would fail if the water table met the agency’s objectives, and 71 would run dry if it sank to its failure point. Those numbers are probably even higher, said Dahlquist-Willard, but many vulnerable wells are older than the state database. The plan assumes agricultural wells are about 600ft deep, but some small farmers in the area have just 80ft wells. “One question is, what happens under Sgma?” she said. “Another question is, what happens under Sgma when there’s another drought and the options are more limited than they were in the last drought?” Gianina Thaoxaochay and her husband are Hmong, a tight-knit agrarian community in Fresno. They farm 10 motley acres just south of the city, lined with a variety of flowers and vegetables, including carrots, beets, bok choy, long beans and Asian squash. Thaoxaochay, 50, relies on groundwater for all her irrigation. She pays for an allotment of surface water from her irrigation district, even though she doesn’t use it – it comes just twice a month, which isn’t often enough to grow vegetables. Like many other small acreage farmers in local Latino and Asian ethnic farming communities, Thaoxaochay only found out about Sgma recently. When she heard about the law on the radio last year, she was shocked. “I’m worried. Without that water we cannot grow anything at all,” she said. “It seems like things are getting tougher and tougher.” There is a little more hope for small growers with more cost-effective, higher-value permanent crops like fruits and nuts, and the access to surface water to irrigate them. Masumoto, the peach farmer, has a clear view of the snowy Sierra Nevada mountain range. That snowpack has been scant in this extraordinarily dry winter – roughly half of average – but the soil on the Masumoto family farm is still moist, the color of chocolate milk. Masumoto dug her fingers into the ground. “We’re in a really lucky position,” she said, brushing the dirt from her hands. Farms here on Fresno’s east side are naturally wetter, receiving more average rainfall than their neighbors to the west. Masumoto also relies on the Sierra snowmelt, which flows through a series of canals managed by the local irrigation district. Her farm happens to sit alongside one of those open channels, which helps recharge the water table below her land. “The story of water is not local – it’s hyper, hyper, hyper-local,” she said. Where other farmers fear the impacts of Sgma, Masumoto is more fearful of inaction. “Locally it seems to me like the good old boys’ club is being entrusted with implementing Sgma,” she said. “It’s not matching the urgency with which I feel we must adapt, prepare, invest and change our ways of being farmers.” “We’ve fallowed land – a lot of our land,” she said, looking out over a lush expanse on the farm that used to be planted with rows of grapevines. “I would much rather all of us give up a little to keep on surviving than put blinders on as if there aren’t going to be climatic changes.” Farmers who can afford it are hoping to offset Sgma’s impact not by fallowing, but by tapping other resources. Larger firms are able to lobby for additional water rights, plant higher-value crops, buy surface water through brokers or buy land that comes with additional water access. In Fresno county, the water flows from east to west by way of nature, pumps and politics. The Westlands irrigation district covers roughly 1,000 square miles and represents the water interests of 700 farms on the west side of the county, making it the largest agricultural irrigation district in the US. Where growers here have drilled deeper for their water, the ground has sunk into “cones of depression”, drawing more water from the east. Farmers in the area relied on groundwater alone to water their crops until Westlands came late to California’s water wars in 1952. But what the district lacked in good timing, it has made up in economic and political muscle. Westlands is seeking permanent rights to water diverted from the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta, after decades of temporary contracts. Powerful allies in the federal government may help it succeed: the interior secretary, David Bernhardt, lobbied on behalf of Westlands before joining the Trump administration, and continued working on Westlands issues after agreeing to stop. Under Bernhardt and Donald Trump, the interior department has paved the way for re-engineering California’s water allocations and sending, in Trump’s words, “as much water as possible” to farmers. Westlands contends that additional surface water, whether from the government or private purchase, is key to the sustainability of its aquifers under Sgma. “Westlands plans to continue acquiring supplemental water transfers to augment its Central Valley Project surface water allocation, which will reduce groundwater pumping,” Katarina Campbell, Westlands’ supervisor of resources, said in a statement. Daniel Errotabere, 64, is a third-generation farmer and the president of the Westlands board of directors. “Some degree of regulation was probably needed to save us from ourselves, but now we’ve become extremely inflexible in drought times,” he said. “In the old days when we had plenty of surface water, we would only pump in truly dry years. Now we’re pumping almost all the time. In the big picture, the answer to groundwater usage is surface water delivery.” Errotabere and his two brothers use drip irrigation on the almonds, pistachios, wine grapes, cotton and vegetables on their 5,200 acres in order to keep water use – and costs – low. Looking to raise receipts, Errotabere and other growers across the valley have turned to higher-profit commodities like nuts, which are far more valuable than fruits and vegetables. California almond acreage has more than doubled since 2000. They are also a less labor-intensive crop. But what growers save in worker costs, they can end up spending on water: it takes a gallon to produce one almond. “We catch a lot of arrows for growing almonds, but those are the ones that pay the bills. I used to love growing a lot of cantaloupes and lettuce, but it just financially can’t work,” he said. “Under all this stuff, you can’t be a small family farm. It’s driving out the smaller players – they can’t keep up.” Between 2017 and 2018, California lost more than 1,000 farms, most of them small. Public comments on groundwater sustainability plans reveal that managers of large farms are looking to learn more about plans for water credits and new markets that would allow for the sale of more water. The ranks of those large farms are growing – despite increasing dryness, there is still money to be made in Central Valley soil. Over the last decade and a half, right through the drought, hedge funds including the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and Hancock Agricultural Investment Group have increasingly become major players in the Central Valley. Luis Katsurayama has managed Jasmine Vineyards in Kern county for six seasons. In recent years, he’s watched mid-sized grape growers around him sell, one after another. “These pension funds and investment firms see this land as a goldmine,” he said. “We’re going to lose out on a lot of the farming essence of California.” Kern county nearly matches Fresno’s agricultural output, but the farms here are larger – on average, over 1,200 acres. This is where Trump visited to rally with farmers and sign a long-promised memorandum to deliver more water through federal channels, over objections from the governor, Gavin Newsom, and environmentalists. “It would be different if you had a drought,” he told the Bakersfield crowd erroneously – more than half of the state is abnormally dry or in moderate drought. “You don’t have a drought. You have tremendous amounts of water.” If a wet spring compensates for this dry winter, all that promised water could make up some of the Sgma difference. But it will still have to actually get here. And the Friant-Kern canal, a 152-mile federal lifeline for 15,000 farms across the valley, has been so damaged by land subsidence from overpumping groundwater that it can now carry less than half of the water it was designed to convey. Less water means more expensive water, one way or another, at a time when growers are also coping with other rising costs. At Jasmine, they’re pulling out some of the farm’s least productive vineyards. The fields will go fallow until they figure out how, and if, they can afford to farm them again. “We’re trying to diversify but let’s be realistic – we’re grape growers. How many almond trees can really be planted here in the Central Valley?” said Katsurayama. With the institution of Sgma, experts expect more almonds, more contraction and more consolidation. That will send ripple effects across the valley and beyond, as farmland values dip and produce prices rise. But the first to feel it will be the people who once worked the now-empty fields. On a dry winter morning in the vineyards of a Delano grape grower in Kern county, workers pruned back dried vines under a clear, sunny sky, making their way quickly down the rows. Sgma may control these workers’ fates, but they had never heard of the law. Maria Duran, 35, has been working in the fields for 14 seasons. “I hadn’t heard about it at all,” she said in Spanish from behind the bandanna that covered her face, protecting her from the valley dust. She furrowed her brow and readjusted her gloved grip on the long pruning shears. “The ones who are going to feel it the most are farmworkers.”"
"Greenpeace faces a heavy fine after admitting that its climate activists boarded a North Sea oil rig in defiance of a court order last year. Transocean, the US-based drilling contractor, has asked the court of session in Edinburgh to impose unlimited fines on Greenpeace UK and consider jailing its executive director, John Sauven, for contempt of court. The legal action is the latest challenge by an oil major following Greenpeace’s decision to switch the focus of its climate campaign to the North Sea oil industry in protest at its role in the climate crisis. In December, Shell won a court ruling banning Greenpeace from occupying four of its rigs in the Brent field after Lady Carmichael, a judge in Edinburgh, ruled that the protest group was breaching Shell’s property rights and risking its activists’ safety.  The Transocean case came after Greenpeace activists climbed on to the Paul B Loyd rig while it was at anchor in the Cromarty Firth north of Inverness in June last year. Greenpeace was protesting at its contract to drill new oil wells in the Vorlich field for BP.  The day after the first group of activists boarded the rig on 9 June, Transocean and BP won an interim interdict, or emergency injunction, banning Greenpeace from occupying it or coming within 500 metres of it while at sea. That first group was removed by police on 13 June. The following day, two more activists occupied the rig for less than 24 hours. After the rig left the Cromarty Firth under tow to the Vorlich field, speedboats from the Greenpeace International protest ship Arctic Sunrise briefly breached the 500-metre exclusion zone around it. Lawyers for Greenpeace UK admitted in the court on Monday that they knew both incidents put the organisation in contempt of court. James Mure QC, for Greenpeace, told Lady Wolffe, the judge, they were justified in defying the court order to raise public awareness of the significant impact that North Sea oil production was having on the climate. With Sauven sitting behind him, Mure said there was scientific consensus that drilling for new oil reserves would breach the Paris agreement on capping carbon emissions, and would accelerate climate heating. Before pleading for leniency and an acceptance that Greenpeace was acting in the public interest, Mure cited statements from BP executives including Bob Dudley, the company’s chairman, admitting that the world faced a climate crisis. Greenpeace was upholding a long tradition of civil disobedience, Mure added. “There are few amongst us who are willing to bear witness [to the climate crisis] in a more challenging way,” he told the court. Wolffe confirmed she had read Greenpeace’s submissions on the climate science and the Paris agreement, and said: “One just has to have regard to the extraordinary weather events on the continent in the last month or two.” Despite supporting the first emergency injunction, BP has not joined in with Transocean’s decision to sue Greenpeace for contempt – the environmental campaign group believes that shows BP is anxious to avoid unfavourable publicity. Jonathan Barne QC, acting for Transocean, said his client “does not call into question the sincerity of the beliefs or the motives which led to this action, and the pursuer doesn’t call into question Greenpeace’s right to protest”. But by the time the second group of activists had climbed on the rig, Greenpeace “had made their point and made their point well”. Greenpeace “breached the interdict in the full knowledge it was doing so and Greenpeace wore that breach as a badge of honour”, he added. That was a direct challenge to the authority of the court and a restriction of Transocean’s rights to go about its business, and was inherently dangerous, Barne said. Wolffe said she would announce her decision in court on 23 March."
"There are beautiful signs of spring popping up in the grounds of the hospice where I work. It’s hard not to have mixed emotions: it is beautiful, especially bathed in bright winter sunshine, but knowing it’s only early February means we could just as quickly have deep snow next week. The life that’s appearing feels all the more fragile at this time of year and in turn it’s a reminder of the crisis our planet is facing. The photo of flowers above was taken this year on a ‘path of life’ at St Gemma’s hospice in Leeds on 6 February. The path is a place where anyone can come to reflect and remember. The wintry photo is from a similar time last year on 1 February when there was snow on the ground. Looking at the two they look like completely different seasons. In early February last year our gardening team were out clearing snow off the paths, whereas this year there’s barely been a hint of it. Natalie Clince, digital marketing manager, Leeds  With the warmer weather our rhubarb is growing strong – which is a concern if we have frost later. Our rhubarb is organic and has been in the garden since we bought the house over 30 years ago. This year they seem to be appearing incredibly early. The daffodils are just coming up now too. I was in shock at how early they were and how beautiful and vibrant the colours are against the starkness of winter. Clare Howarth, 54, designer, from Manchester Serra da Estrela is the highest mountain range in mainland Portugal, reaching 1,993 metres above the sea. Back in the late 80s and early 90s it was very common to see snow at this time of year. Lately it is rare a snowfall will last more than a couple of days, except at the top. It’s actually becoming more common to watch the fruit trees blossoming earlier. The above photo was taken on 5 February this year, a very warm day of about 20C, and shows an almond tree in bloom – something that usually happens in early March. The below photo was taken in February 2013 at the same location but showing the surroundings on a snowy day. Isabel Garcia, 35, Portugal My partner and I are passionate hill walkers, hikers and in general outdoorsy people, so there’s plenty of room to compare. It’s been an incredibly warm winter this year and we’ve barely noticed the snowcaps on the hills in Lomond and Trossachs national park. Last year we were not able to take the road over the hills from Aberfoyle due to ice and snow; today it was completely clear and not a sign of snow. We found these flowers during a walk in February this year around Loch Katrine, near the southern slopes of Primrose Hill. It’s a stark contrast compared to last winter here in Scotland when we went over snow of 10-15 centimetres for many kilometres – bloom was completely out of question. Martynas Virzintas, 39, hospitality manager, from Glasgow  Spring is starting to burst out all over. The snowdrops have appeared and opened fully within a few days which is a little puzzling as they seem to have done so more rapidly than usual. Rather strangely, most of the flowers are coming out at the same time, even though they are normally staggered between late January through until April. Often the UK winter is persistently dull and grey – but not this year. David Seedhouse, author, Wolverly, West Midlands I am chair of an environment scrutiny commission looking at ways we can reduce our carbon emissions in Southwark. I live in the middle of the city on the river and took the below photo in Southwark park, one of the oldest in London. I have noticed that spring is coming earlier and earlier each year. Snowdrops, prunus, narcissus and iris are not usually fully out but they are in full vigour right now. Blossom does make dreary places look beautiful and at the moment the scents of spring are greeting us before the end of winter. Leanne Werner, Labour councillor in Southwark, London Mount Fuji is visible most days from the training ring where I work as a horse groom. Locals say that usually at this time of year the whole mountain is white. Last year there was more snow in January and February, whereas this year Fuji-san is only half covered in snow. You can see this from the photo I took on 3 January this year. Even though it was last year, when I arrived in Japan on 21 March, I noticed the sakura (cherry blossom) bloomed four days later when normally this doesn’t happen until April.

"A builder from Merseyside has launched a project that aims to remove plastic from the British construction industry within two decades. Neal Maxwell, who has worked in the trade for more than 30 years, co-founded the non-profit organisation Changing Streams after a trip to the Arctic. Appalled by the levels of plastic pollutants in the Arctic Ocean and the often-lethal impact on animals in the polar region, Maxwell and researchers from the University of Liverpool have drawn up a programme that they say could make construction plastic-free by 2040. The sector is the second largest producer of plastic waste in the UK, after packaging. It is estimated the building trade generates 50,000 tonnes of plastic waste each year. Along with the architect Dr Gareth Abrahams from the university’s School of Environmental Science, Maxwell has drafted a charter that they hope could become legally binding. The programme for the construction indusry includes:  the phasing out of paint containing plastic; the establishment of a “traffic light” guide to warn which paints contain plastic to dissuade DIY consumers from buying them; the creation of a template house made without plastic; the end of the use of plastic wrapping for building materials such as bricks and cladding. Maxwell co-founded Changing Streams in 2018 after he and his wife toured the Arctic on a scientific exploration ship. He said: “On board were 20 scientific specialists from all around the world who helped us understand about the environment and the impact global warming and plastic pollution was having. “We were told about the walruses while out in kayaks and learned about their feeding habits and plastic ingestion via clams when in the water. But the moment of truth for me came when we got back to England, when I went on our first food shop at the supermarket to stock up the kitchen again. When I saw row upon row of things covered in plastic it turned my stomach – I had to get out of the shop. “When I got home I realised I had to do something about plastic pollution. And I could only do that in the industry I’ve worked in for over 30 years. That trip and that moment in the supermarket afterwards convinced me that I should try to make my industry plastic-free.” Maxwell said he was even more shocked when he discovered how much plastic was used in the construction business. He and Abrahams hope a “carrot and stick” approach can win over builders, many of whom fear replacing plastic will raise their costs. “We will not only ask government eventually to adopt this as legally binding regulations, but also petition large pension fund providers which finance construction to adopt the charter as well,” Maxwell said. Abrahams says the University of Liverpool aims to construct plastic-free accommodation on its campus, which is undergoing a multimillion-pound rebuild. He said: “One of our projects is to create the first ever plastic-neutral commercially viable house. We want to show the building industry this can be done. And through things like coding paint we can hopefully change consumer behaviour as well.” Maxwell says plastic became widely used in the late 1950s and 60s. “What did we do before [it] was ubiquitous? Pre-plastic, we built houses, factories, offices and buildings without it. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel here. There are alternatives we have used before and new ones we can invent. “We used to use asbestos throughout our industry before we knew the damage it was doing to our lungs. We know the damage plastic is doing to our planet and other species. Shouldn’t we treat plastic as the new asbestos?”"
"One in 10 of all new homes in England since 2013 have been built on land at the highest risk of flooding, official figures reveal, potentially leaving tens of thousands of people in greater danger from extreme winter storms. The number of properties built in these high-risk areas annually has more than doubled in recent years, with more than 84,000 new at-risk homes in total since 2013, according to a Guardian analysis of government data. In the aftermath of the devastating Storms Ciara and Dennis, experts and council leaders have warned that residents are being left at risk in part due to the pressure on local authorities to build thousands of new homes despite a dearth of suitable sites. Prof Robert Wilby, of the University of Loughborough, said the government should review its housebuilding target in light of the increasing risk from floods: “We’re compounding the existing risk by continuing to build on the floodplain. The more we’re paving over natural areas the more we’re making it easier for water to move across the land and enter rivers.” The figures emerged on Wednesday, with householders across large parts of the country braced for further bad weather, with another month’s worth of rain expected in the next 24 hours in some places. Those already battling the aftermath of several days worth of rain have been told to expect even more, with pockets of North Wales, northern England and Scotland among those in line for further deluges. Thousands of people have already been affected by the most damaging winter storms in recent times, with the worst hit areas in South Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire, where major incidents have been declared. With many people forced to evacuate their homes, experts warned that targets given to local authorities for new builds often fail to take into account local flood risk. The government has promised to build 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s to help solve the UK’s chronic housing shortage. Data from the ministry of housing, communities and local government (MHCLG) shows that the number of new houses built on land at the highest risk of flooding has risen from 9,500 in 2013 to 20,000 in 2017-18, following a peak of nearly 24,000 the previous year. In Calderdale, the West Yorkshire valley that has been hit by four floods in the past eight years, one in five new homes have been built on land with a high risk of flooding since 2015. The data relates to houses built in what the Environment Agency calls “flood zone 3”, the highest level of risk where the likelihood of flooding is 1% or higher each year. Tim Swift, the leader of Calderdale council, said local authorities had been left in an “impossible position” due to the housebuilding targets imposed on them by central government and the pressure to alleviate the flood risk. “Councils are stuck between the government demands for housebuilding and the difficulties for identifying suitable sites,” he said. “There’s got to be a look at planning policy and the relationship between housing numbers and the pressures on flooding.” Wilby said the issue was one of several that needed to be examined by the government in light of storms Ciara and Dennis. He said ministers also needed to rethink contingency planning for widespread disasters like these – with multiple agencies with often overlapping roles on the ground – and ensure the regular maintenance of flood defences and drainage systems. Another key issue is funding. Boris Johnson has committed to spending £4bn over the next five years on flood defence schemes. However, the Environment Agency and independent experts have said this is too little and that money needs to be committed way beyond 2025 so planners can mitigate future disasters. “A greater level of investment would mean that we could prepare better for floods,” said Prof Hannah Cloke, of the University of Reading, who is helping the Environment Agency respond to the widespread damage caused by storms Ciara and Dennis. She said that with more funding “people would not be at such great risk” and planners could make bold changes to cities and landscapes that at the moment “we just can’t do”. She added: “You can’t plan ahead to deal with climate change unless you have a sustainable funding source to take those big measures, to redesign cities and landscapes so we can design better for floods.” Ministers have also been advised to place more emphasis on natural flood management, such as planting trees, building so-called “leaky dams” and capturing water upstream, as well as building more hard structures like flood barriers. An MHCLG spokeswoman said: “Local authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need and our planning policy is clear that housing should be located in the areas at least risk of flooding.” She added that when development in a risk area was “absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding”. However, in Calderdale, Swift said while there were measures to ensure new homes were flood-resilient, in practice this relied on good building control and regulations and that it was “not always possible to achieve that”."
"The canals of the West Midlands may seem an unlikely source of warmth, but these waterways could soon be used to heat hospitals and tower blocks under a plan to harness Britain’s hidden heating sources. The government has promised to spend more than £20m on nine schemes across the country to exploit cheap, renewable heat from canals, old mineshafts and in London tube lines. It will spend another £70m to build some of Europe’s first plants to generate green hydrogen gas for homes and factories, including a project in Grimsby that will use the clean electricity generated by offshore wind turbines to make the low-carbon alternative gas from water. Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for business, energy and clean growth, said cleaning up emissions from industry and housing was a big challenge, and an important part of “eliminating our contribution to climate change by 2050 while also growing our economy”. The government’s hunt for alternative renewable sources of heat has gained pace after ministers pledged to ban gas-fired boilers from newbuild homes from 2025. Officials estimate that the latest funding could provide a local renewable energy resource to 250,000 people by 2030, which would cut their energy bills by half while helping the UK to meet its climate targets. Birmingham’s canals have been picked to play a role in the UK’s green heating revolution by GreenSCIES, which is also working on a proposal that uses “waste heat”from the London underground to warm hundreds of homes in Islington, north London. The consortium, led by London South Bank University, plans to use the government funding to grow the GreenSCIES project and install water source heat pumps in the canal, which runs through Sandwell near Birmingham. The heat pumps work like a refrigerator in reverse, using a coolant gas to transfer heat from the water to be piped into a council tower block of 1,200 residents, many of whom are fuel poor. An extension of the project could be used to warm Birmingham City hospital. Heat pumps will also be used at another government-backed project in Rugeley, north of Birmingham, where a defunct coal-fired power plant is to be turned into a sustainable village of 2,300 homes, warmed by local canals and geothermal heat from disused mineshaft. Once at full scale, the Islington project will provide heat to an estimated 33,000 residents and nearly 70 local businesses. It will also help to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 80% compared with traditional gas-fuelled heating systems while also addressing fuel poverty. Government officials also plan to throw their support behind two schemes, on the banks of the Mersey and near Aberdeen, to produce low-carbon hydrogen by splitting traditional heating gas and capturing the carbon dioxide that is released before it can contribute to global heating. Hydrogen was injected directly into a UK gas network for the first time this year. A 20% blend of hydrogen in the national gas grid could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 6m tonnes a year – the equivalent of taking 2.5m cars off the road."
"Storm Dennis is believed to have caused the worst winter floods in recent times, in part because the rain was so widespread but also because it has fallen on ground already saturated from Storm Ciara the previous week. Storm Dennis affected huge swaths of Britain, from the Scottish Highlands to the Cornish coast and large parts of Wales and Northern Ireland. It triggered a record-breaking number of Environment Agency flood warnings and alerts in England on Sunday. The Environment Agency says its flood defences – both permanent and temporary measures – are working. It says that as many as 20,000 properties have been protected from storms Ciara and Dennis due to these measures. However, Britain has experienced an exceptionally wet winter and many rural areas, including towns and villages, have been left vulnerable to the higher river levels and saturated ground. Also, physical flood structures are only one part of the armoury. Flood barriers are a small but important part of the protection from devastating storms. Experts say that while Britain can never be fully flood-proof, much more could be done to better protect those in vulnerable areas. One way is to have a robust planning policy that keeps new housing developments out of flood plains. Another is natural flood management, such as planting trees, building “leaky dams” and water storage facilities. These all help slow the flow of water downstream and would take the edge off severe storms , said Prof Hannah Cloke, of the University of Reading. Prof Robert Wilby, of Loughborough University, said natural flood management would help mitigate small floods but would be overwhelmed by the likes of Ciara and Dennis. Another important tool is forecasting: the Met Office’s new £1.2bn supercomputer could be a game-changer in predicting the areas most at risk of flooding. Experts say more energy should be devoted to contingency planning, local resilience measures and regular maintenance of flood defences and drainage systems. The government says it invests in areas of the highest priority. Critics say this often means protecting urban areas or properties of high commercial value, at the expense of rural communities, farms and villages. One problem is the fluctuating amount of money set aside for flood prevention each year, which means agencies cannot plan too far ahead or invest in radical changes to the landscape. In early 2019, the Environment Agency said at least £1bn a year was needed to tackle flooding and coastal erosion – more than the £600m-£800m a year that has been spent since 2010. Boris Johnson’s government has committed to spending £4bn on the issue over the next five years but experts argue that a more ambitious programme needs to be implemented, looking at a broader range of defence mechanisms. “Hard flood defences are just a tiny part of what we should be doing,” said Cloke. “There’s no realistic way we can manage future flooding with hard flood defences – we really need to be thinking more than that.” The recent floods have been so widespread and damaging because the ground across Britain is saturated. It has been an exceptionally wet winter so far with autumn rainfall records being broken for South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. England as a whole had its fifth wettest autumn on record. Why? In large part, this is due to the climate emergency. Evidence from the Met Office shows the number of winter storms has increased in the north Atlantic and that they are getting stronger. Heavy rainfall events are also becoming more frequent: warmer air carries more moisture, which means rain falls in heavier showers."
"Before the storms, blue sky lures us out to the less familiar Devon side of the valley. Over there, in the centre of Bere Alston, red crab apples cling to ornamental trees and a nearby line of washing billows dry beside the wind-rocked branches of pink camellia. Blasting across from Hingston Down, gusts buffet full-out daffodils on top of hedges; more sheltered lanes drop downhill between banks of pennywort and moss overhung by swaying catkins. Towards Tuckermarsh Quay, past the bridge over a cutting of the derelict Southern Railway (linking Plymouth with Waterloo via Okehampton), woodland overwhelms formerly cultivated plots. Daffodil buds point skyward between ivy, hart’s-tongue fern, primrose and spears of onion-scented ramson; fallen trees sprawl among hazel bushes and the midday sun sidelights tall mossy trunks. Down by the Tamar, opposite sunlit Calstock, shady Buttspill Wood occupies a river cliff with undergrowth of shining holly grounded in the absorbent leaf mould of oak and beech. Out in the open and beneath the viaduct, a path continues on the levee separating vacated green pastures of Ferry Farm from straw-coloured reedbeds lapped by the flooding tide. Around the Danescoombe bend, Cotehele’s chapel in the wood perches on a rocky promontory among lichen-encrusted trees; downstream, the tide-washed “hard” beneath South Ward Mine was the landing stage for an established ferry across this waterway. A century ago my grandfather would have been rowed over from Cornwall, en route from the manorial mill to Plymouth’s Corn Exchange, via the railway station, a mile-long walk uphill. Beyond Braunder Wood, land harvested of maize for fodder remains impacted and waterlogged, shedding runoff towards the river; sheep and lambs on steeper ground along an adjoining tributary tread lighter than a group of Hereford yearlings further on, but most fields await drier weather before animals can be turned out. Drab unshorn hedgebanks and regenerating woodland masking abandoned market gardens and historic mine workings brighten in today’s sunshine, glossing ripe ivy berries, gilding yellow gorse and masses of catkins. Towards Halton Quay and Pentillie the expanse of water appears as a shining lake before the ebb reveals mudbanks and strands of wrack and debris."
"Last week, the UN issued a warning about the numbers of desert locusts currently swarming through much of East Africa; they have now reached Uganda and Tanzania. The outbreak is the largest for decades and has already devastated crops in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, countries with fragile food security. The problem is not confined to Africa, with swarms also occurring in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. In the current outbreak, one swarm in Kenya measured 40km by 60km and as many as 150m locusts can gather in a square kilometre. It is estimated that even a small swarm can devour enough food for 35,000 people daily. When a single desert locust – actually a type of short-horned grasshopper in the family Acrididae – lives alone it is light brown in colour and does relatively little damage. However, when the environment is favourable (often after heavy rain and cyclones) and lots of locusts come together in the same place – they change colour to pink (immature) and then yellow (mature) and form swarms, a process known as gregarisation. There is no reliable way to tackle a swarm of locusts. Their occurrence and movements are hard to predict and they move very fast over large, often very remote areas. They can be sprayed with pesticide from planes and drones. The best tactic is to spray the locusts before the gregarisation process begins; Mauritania has been praised for taking this pre-emptive approach. Heavy rains help create perfect breeding conditions for locusts and these have been caused recently by a powerful cyclone off Somalia. Some forecasters suggest that an increase in the frequency of Indian Ocean cyclones could be due to global heating, which may lead to more regular swarming in Africa."
"A temporary ban on wildlife markets in China to curb the spread of coronavirus is “not enough” and should be made permanent, a prominent Chinese environmental leader has told the Guardian. Echoing calls from experts worldwide who have denounced the trade for its damaging impact on biodiversity as well as the spread of disease, Jinfeng Zhou, secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF), said the ban failed to address the root cause of the outbreak, which was poor regulation and high levels of illegal trade. The flu-like virus is believed to have emerged from Huanan seafood market in the industrial city of Wuhan where wild animals such as snakes, porcupines and pangolins were kept alive in small cages while waiting to be sold. The national ban means the trade of wild animals will not be allowed in markets, restaurants or on e-commerce sites until the coronavirus outbreak ends, Chinese officials said on Sunday. Zhou told the Guardian: “This temporary ban is not enough. The trade should be banned indefinitely, at least until new rules are introduced. We have had similar diseases caused by illegal wildlife trafficking and if we don’t ban the trade these diseases will happen again.” China has a wildlife protection law that was adopted in 1988 but the list of protected wild animals has not been updated for three decades and critics say the authorities do little to enforce it. The CBCGDF – which was founded in 1985 and is one of China’s oldest wildlife organisations – is lobbying for a new biodiversity protection law to properly safeguard the country’s wildlife. Zhou said: “The announcement [on Sunday] lacked clear regulations on management, control and punishment. If there are no rules, there are no rules – there must be a set of responsibilities in order for officials to control the trade.” The temporary ban has put the spotlight on China’s poorly regulated wildlife trade, which is driven by the country’s appetite for traditional medicines and exotic foods. Before Huanan seafood market was closed on 1 January, it contained 30 species of animal, including live wolf pups, salamanders, golden cicadas, civets and bamboo rats. Animals sold in these markets are often kept in filthy conditions and left to fester in their own waste, which means they incubate diseases that can then spill into human populations. Similar markets are found all over the country and have been the source of outbreaks in the past. Dr Christian Walzer, chief global veterinarian at for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said the temporary ban was an important first step in making China’s wildlife trade permanently illegal. “Humans are getting sick from eating or being exposed to wildlife in these markets; wildlife populations are being depleted as they are poached and hunted for these markets; and economies and the poor are harmed as the mass culling of animals in response to these outbreaks increase the cost of basic animal protein (domesticated farm animals like chickens and pigs) that hit the poor the hardest.” In 2002–3, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) – which is a type of coronavirus – spread across China and went on to kill 800 people worldwide. It resulted in a temporary ban on wild animal markets, and bats were later found to be the source. Chinese government medical advisers have identified badgers, snakes and rats as possible sources of the latest outbreak. However, the current wildlife trade ban will have no impact on curbing the spread of the virus, according to Prof James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge. Evidence suggests it was a “single spillover event to humans, followed by human to human transmission”, he said. While most people would strongly support bans on the marketing of live wild animals, it is not always simple to implement overnight bans on well-established types of trade, according to Wood. “Jinfeng Zhou makes statements that are highly informed by detailed knowledge of the situation regarding wildlife markets in China,” he said. “It is important that clear frameworks are developed and implemented, as otherwise it could be possible for wild-caught animals to be sold at markets that have been developed for animals bred in captivity.” The temporary ban comes as China prepares to host the major Convention on Biological Diversity in Kunming this October, which is a chance for world leaders to agree a new action plan to stop global extinctions in the next decade. Globally 8,775 species are at risk of extinction as a result of illegal trading, according to a 2019 paper published in Science. Steven Galster, founder of the anti-wildlife-trafficking group Freeland, said: “China is to be congratulated for taking such a bold move to ban the wildlife trade and we should encourage China to keep this ban in place permanently. A sustained ban will save human lives, and contribute to a recovery of wildlife populations worldwide.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

"Powers to prevent the export of plastic waste to developing countries, binding targets on air and water quality and the protection of wildlife will be enshrined in law under the environment bill due to be introduced in parliament on Thursday. The commitments will replace the UK’s current obligations on environmental protection under EU law, and the UK will be able to diverge in future from new requirements in EU regulations. The government has promised to review every two years “significant developments in international legislation on the environment to ensure we keep abreast of developments”, but it will not be obliged to update British law in line with any such developments. Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, said: “We have set out our pitch to be a world leader on the environment as we leave the EU, and the environment bill is a crucial part of achieving this. It sets a gold standard for improving air quality, protecting nature, increasing recycling and cutting down on plastic waste.” While the bill will create a framework for legally binding targets, these targets – such as limits on air pollutants – will not be in place until October 2022 after the government has consulted widely. On air pollution, the government has pledged an “ambitious” target to reduce fine particulate matter, a lung-damaging pollutant that has been linked to numerous illnesses. But it is not clear whether other pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide, will be included, and what powers will be available to local authorities to reduce pollution in their areas. Ruth Chambers, of the Greener UK coalition, said it was not clear that the new bill would strengthen existing protections. “There are continuing concerns that ministers will decide the green watchdog’s budget and board, with a weaker legal status for environmental principles,” she said. “Reviewing international legislation could be helpful, but cannot and should not be seen as a substitute for committing in law to the high standards we already enjoy.” The new commitment to ban plastic exports to poor countries – an increasing problem for the developing world, as China has closed its doors to plastic for recycling – is the main addition to the bill since its last version under Theresa May’s government, which had to be abandoned during the parliamentary wrangles over Brexit. However, Libby Peake, of the Green Alliance, said the commitment only repeated the UK’s obligation under the Basel convention, which is independent of Brexit. “The UK already has the power to stop polluting plastic leaving our shores, but has been terrible at enforcing it,” she said. “The Environment Agency has been under-resourced to carry out inspections and carried out only three unannounced site visits in 2017-18.” The environment bill will join the updated agriculture bill and fisheries bill in forming a new legal framework for environmental protections post-Brexit. For the last four decades the UK’s obligations on these issues have been laid out largely in Brussels. The bill gives people a greater say in the management of local street trees, which have been the subject of fierce rows in Sheffield and other parts of the country. It will also enshrine in law the idea of “biodiversity net gain” – that is, when construction or other development takes place, any natural ecosystems that are lost or disturbed as a result will be restored or recreated elsewhere, for instance through tree-planting.

"VicForests has been forced to immediately stop logging in parts of Victoria’s central highlands after the supreme court granted an injunction to a citizen science group pushing for a stop to logging of unburnt areas in the wake of bushfires. Wildlife of the Central Highlands (Wotch) has launched a fresh case against VicForests in a bid to stop logging of threatened species habitat after the country’s unprecedented fire season. Late on Wednesday, the court granted an interim injunction to halt clearing of forest in three coupes that were being logged. A larger injunction covering 10 coupes for the duration of the case will be sought when the matter is before the court again in February. Wotch brought the case because the areas targeted for logging are habitat for the greater glider, the smoky mouse, the sooty owl and the powerful owl. The Victorian government has identified each of these among the species it holds immediate concern for as a result of the unprecedented bushfire crisis. Wotch alleges that logging in areas where threatened species affected by the fires have been sighted or where there is known habitat is illegal until the state and federal governments conclude their responses to the bushfires for wildlife. The court accepted that there was “prima facie” evidence of a threat of “serious or irreversible damage” to threatened species and their habitat if harvesting operations continued in the coupes. The court said “the recent bushfires have caused extensive environmental damage, the severity of which is only beginning to be understood”. Danya Jacobs, a senior lawyer with Environmental Justice Australia, said it was a good result for threatened species “who suffered a huge blow after the catastrophic bushfires”. “Important unburnt habitat is now safe from logging, while this case moves to the next stage,” she said. Philip Marshall, a citizen scientist with Wotch, said it was important the forests were protected. “We cannot allow logging to continue the widespread destruction inflicted by these bushfires when the central highlands are among the last refuges for these precious species,” he said. VicForests said it was unable to comment on matters that were before the court."
"Banning the import and export of big game hunting trophies would recognise the destructive impact European powers have had on wildlife in former African and Asian colonies, Sir Ranulph Fiennes has said. Speaking to the Guardian, the veteran British explorer said hunting endangered species such as rhinos, elephants and lions to keep their body parts as trophies should be viewed with the same scepticism as Chinese traditional medicine in terms of the damage it does to biodiversity. The 75-year-old explorer, who spent a large part of his childhood in South Africa, has called for trophy hunting to be “stopped country by country” and said efforts to halt the extinction of wildlife around the world were hypocritical while big game hunting was still allowed. Reflecting on his early years in Cape Town and the influence of the British empire on trophy hunting, Fiennes said: “Just as much as the Belgians in the Congo and the French elsewhere, they unleashed the plague of persecuting animals – not like the locals did to eat, but purely for the pleasure of killing. That started the devastating damage to many, many wonderful species.” Comparing trophy hunting with the demand for ingredients such as powdered rhino horn in traditional medicine in Asia, he added: “It’s not medically proven in any way. And yes, it goes on. China is particularly guilty, as are South Korea and many other countries in that area. “You’ve got the empire lot and the weird medical quack lot both going on to this current day and it’s got to be stopped country by country. We can stop it in the UK at least and thereby feel slightly less guilty because of our ancestors.” Fiennes’s comments come during a consultation by the British government on applying controls to trophy hunting, including a proposal to ban imports, that was laid out in the Queen’s speech. In the wake of the death of Cecil the lion in 2015, France, Netherlands and Australia introduced bans on the import of lion trophies. Last year, the Guardian revealed lion bones, leopard skulls and an ottoman chair’s elephant leather were among the 74 rare animal body parts legally brought into the UK in 2018. Under international rules overseen by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), trophies can be moved around the world if they do not affect the survival of a species. Fiennes said: “Bearing in mind that climate change is helping to remove animals and in 50 years time probably humans as well, now is the time for us to get into a position without being hypocritical. “We are all hoping that Boris will see that cruelty is what we’re talking about – bullying bastards are involved and people who are vain sticking lovely dead animals on their walls.” In America, Donald Trump has previously spoken out against big-game trophy hunting despite Donald Trump Jr being a keen hunter. A week-long “dream hunt” with the US president’s son was auctioned off earlier this month at an annual trophy hunting convention organised by Safari Club International (SCI), where it went for $150,000. Another lot offered the chance to shoot an elephant on a 14-day trip to Namibia. Supporters of trophy hunting such as SCI argue that the practise supports conservation efforts for endangered wildlife. The organisation said it had written to the governments of Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe in relation to the proposed trophy hunting import ban in the UK. When contacted by the Guardian about the trophy hunting consultation that ends on 25 February, a Defra spokesperson said: “Following the pre-election and Christmas periods, we are extending the trophy hunting consultation by one month to ensure all interested parties are able to have their say.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"Lions, rhinos and cheetahs are among the wild species at risk of irreversible “genetic pollution” from breeding experiments, scientists have warned. South African game farmers have increasingly been breeding novel trophy animals, including some freakishly-coloured varieties such as the black impala, golden wildebeest or pure-white springboks. Some hunters pay more to bag unusual trophies, but now the South African government is under fire for permitting further gene manipulation ventures that scientists say could have a damaging effect on the continent’s wildlife. Writing in the latest issue of the South African Journal of Science, a group of 10 senior wildlife scientists and researchers have criticised the government for quietly amending the country’s Animal Improvement Act last year to allow for the domestication and “genetic improvement” of at least 24 indigenous wildlife species – including rare and endangered animals such as rhino, cheetah, lion, buffalo and several antelope species. The researchers warn that: “A logical endpoint of this legislation is that we will have two populations of each species: one wild and one domesticated … domesticated varieties of wildlife will represent a novel, genetic pollution threat to South Africa’s indigenous wildlife that will be virtually impossible to prevent or reverse.” Lead author Prof Michael Somers, a senior researcher at the Mammal Research Institute at the University of Pretoria, says the government should scrap the controversial law amendment which lumps together rare and endangered species such as rhinos with rabbits and domesticated dog breeds. Somers and his colleagues say the act typically provides for domesticated species to be bred and “genetically improved” to obtain “superior domesticated animals with enhanced production and performance”. These animals “can also be used for genetic manipulation, embryo harvesting, in-vitro fertilisation and embryo transfers,” say the scientists. They argue that the law will not improve the genetics of the affected wildlife species but rather will pose ecological and economic risks as it will be expensive and almost impossible to maintain a clear distinction between wild and domesticated species. Somers and his colleagues say the government did not appear to have consulted either scientists, government wildlife agencies or the general public about the controversial move. Last year, in response to concerns that the legal amendment would remove the listed species from the ambit of conservation legislation, the government’s environment department issued a statement to emphasise that that game breeders would still have to comply with the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act and regulations concerning threatened or protected species. But Somers and his co-authors remain concerned, saying that in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, where there is close cooperation between game breeders and the provincial conservation organisation, the authorities still had difficulty keeping track of what happens on game farms and in enforcing legislation. “This new law will add to this difficulty, and will likely be less controlled in some other provinces,” they said, adding that the genetic consequences of intensive or semi-intensive breeding of wildlife species were “negative and considerable”. “Intensive breeding through artificial (non random) selection of individuals for commercially valuable traits (eg horn size/shape, coat colour) represents humans taking over this natural process. Such artificial selection by humans is even more powerful than natural selection in creating distinct phenotypes within very short time frames.” Michael Bruford, a professor of biodiversity at the University of Cardiff and co-chair of the Conservation Genetics Specialist Group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, added his support to the concerns raised. “The Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2020 targets clearly state that signatory countries should minimise genetic erosion (loss of genetic diversity) in domestic, socio-economically and culturally valuable species,” he said. “However you regard these species – and they cannot reasonably be classified as domestic animals – South Africa’s proposal will very likely lead to genetic erosion, in contravention of the CBD target,” he added. “This proposal also comes at a time of rapid environmental deterioration, when we need to be increasing the resilience of our species by ensuring they retain as much genetic diversity as possible”."
"An elusive British mammal, the tiny bat Nathusius’ pipistrelle (Pipistrellus nathusii), may be more widespread and numerous than previously thought.  Sometimes described as a rare visitor or a new coloniser because of climate change, it may have been here decades but had gone undetected. Perhaps this is because the species tends to avoid humans and lives in woods on the edge of lakes where insects are plentiful. It is also a featherweight, a maximum of 15g, the same as a 50p coin. All British bats are fragile-looking creatures, most often seen by humans on warm summer evenings at dusk, although they are often unnoticed when out hunting. They even emerge in the winter if it is warm enough. Now that bat detectorists know this species of pipistrelle is resident in the UK, sightings are being reported not just in the south-east of England but in Anglesey, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Cornwall. In the summer breeding season males have territories, the successful ones have a harem of up to 10 females, while others manage only two or three. Perhaps the most extraordinary feature is that they migrate across the North Sea. One that was ringed at Blagdon Lake, near Bristol, was discovered in the Netherlands three years later, 370 miles away. "
"Freshwater insects, mosses and lichens are bucking the trend of wildlife losses in the UK and have expanded their ranges since 1970, according to a new study. Reductions in air and water pollution are the most likely reason. Scientists say their new analysis shows that amid big declines in wildlife, action can help to reverse the trend for some species. The work analysed millions of sightings of 5,000 different invertebrate species by volunteers over 45 years. The research also found that the average range of insects had increased over that time. This finding does not conflict with other reports of serious declines in insect populations, the scientists said. The new analysis considered only whether a species was present or absent from a site, while the other studies measured falls in abundance and, for example, a population could fall by 90% and still occupy the same range. The scientists also said much wildlife had already been lost by 1970, which means that date is a low baseline. The pressures on invertebrate life, as well as better studied mammals and birds, include destruction of natural habitats, pollution and pesticides and, increasingly, the impacts of the climate crisis. “By looking at long-term trends in the distribution of understudied species, we found evidence of concerning declines but we also found that it’s not all bad news,” said Charlie Outhwaite at University College London, who led the new research. The areas in which freshwater insects, such as mayflies, dragonflies and caddisflies, were found plunged by 47% from 1970 to 1994, but have expanded strongly since and were 7% higher in 2015 than 50 years ago. “That coincides with the implementation of the [EU] urban wastewater treatment directive”, which significantly cleaned up rivers, Outhwaite said. Mosses and lichens have expanded their average range by 36% since 1970, the study found. “Mosses and lichens are very sensitive to air quality and it seems like they have been improving” since the Clean Air Act in 1956, she said. The 3,000 species of terrestrial insects analysed experienced a slight increase of 5% in their range since 1970. But Outhwaite said: “We just looked at range and not the number of individuals. So it’s very possible that there are still huge declines happening in terms of the number of individuals.” “We just don’t have abundance data for [most invertebrate species], especially at a national scale,” she said. “So we’ve had to do the best we can by looking at their range size. But it’s really important we don’t over-interpret it and think everything’s fine.” The new work, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, also shows that the ranges of many insect groups in the UK have declined since the mid-2000s. Other research has shown big falls in insect populations since that time, which was when neonicotinoid pesticides were introduced. “The trends in bees seen in this new study mirror the bee trends found in our 2019 research,” said Gary Powney, at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, which was not part of the latest work. “The rapid and substantial decline in these pollinators in the late 2000s is a major cause for concern.” Other groups losing range in the new analysis included spiders and freshwater snails and mussels. The molluscs did not recover after 1994, Outhwaite said, “so something else is driving that change, potentially invasive species”. But fungus gnats and weevils showed strong expansion of their ranges. Determining the exact causes of changes is difficult, she said: “It’s challenging because you have multiple threats happening at the same time.” Prof Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new study, said data collected by volunteer recorders had to be treated carefully. “Recorder effort has greatly increased in recent years, along with the publication of new identification books, online guides, recording apps and so on,” he said. “Obviously the more you look, and the more experienced the recorder, the more you will find. The modelling purports to take this into account, but I do not see how.” The relationship between the range and abundance of species is not clear, Goulson said, although they would be expected to track one another. But the new work suggests range could expand for some species while their abundance falls. “All in all, it’s very puzzling,” he said. “This kind of data is very messy in terms of biases, like sampling effort over time,” said Outhwaite. “But the models are designed to try to take those into account, so they don’t influence our trends.” She also paid tribute to the volunteer recorders. “Our study demonstrates the power of citizen science, as anyone can contribute to impactful research. There are over 80 recording schemes in the UK now, so there is definitely something for you if you are interested.”"
"When a Danish trawler docks on the island of Rügen in the early hours of a stormy Thursday morning, the Euro-Baltic plant at Sassnitz-Mukran suddenly jolts to life. Via a network of subterranean tubes, 1,400 tonnes of slippery North Sea herring are pumped from the belly of the ship and belched out onto an assembly line inside the factory on Germany’s largest island, where the silvery-blue fish are blow-dried, weighed, gutted and either sliced into fillets or chopped into bite-sized chunks. Forty hours earlier, these oily foragers were basking off the coast of the Shetland Islands. Thanks to the European Union’s common fisheries policy (CFP), they now float in vats of marinade, gently shaken every six hours by a robot to spread the brine. Some of them will soon be ready to be wrapped around slices of pickled gherkin to become rollmops, a popular German hangover cure. If Boris Johnson’s government were to have its way, however, the assembly line at Sassnitz-Mukran could soon come to a halt. As negotiations on post-Brexit fishing rights get under way , the UK has reaffirmed its intention to become an independent coastal state when the extension period ends this year. Operating under the UN convention on the law of the sea rather than the CFP, Britain would have control over an exclusive economic zone up to 200 nautical miles off its shore and wants to annually set its own quotas for those it allows to fish in its waters. With the promise to “take back control” resonating particularly loudly in totemic Brexit-supporting fishing communities such as Grimsby, this is likely to mean preferred access to British fishermen and pushing out EU boats. The fear at the herring processing plant on Rügen is that it won’t even come to that. “The worst-case scenario if we get a hard Brexit after all, without an agreement on fishing rights,”said Uwe Richter, the factory’s director, “[is] we’d lose our access rights to the British economic area in an instant and wouldn’t have any opportunities to bring in any herring in the second half of the year.” In theory, under such a scenario it would be possible for Scottish trawlers to deliver herring to Rügen instead. But if a bust-up over fishing rights were to derail negotiations over a trade deal between Britain and the EU, it could quickly spell trouble for Euro-Baltic. “If there is no trade deal we get whacked with tariffs and paperwork, so the herring stinks to the heavens by the time it arrives and the whole business becomes unaffordable,” Richter said. “Herring is a very sensitive fish. You can’t afford to transport it from auction to auction. If you want a good product, you need the shortest routes possible.” Such fears are shared in Berlin’s seats of power. The German government believes the explosive debate around fishing, which makes up only 0.1% of the UK’s economy and 0.02% of Germany’s, has the potential to sour the tone of more important negotiations, such as over trade, security cooperations and financial services. “If the negotiations get bogged down on fishing, which is not crucial economically but highly symbolic and emotive, it becomes harder to have a more sober debate further down the line,” said a German official familiar with the talks. Part of the problem is that fish, and herring in particular, is not just a highly symbolic subject for Britain, but also for the woman at the top of Germany’s government. The Euro-Baltic plant lies in Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I, which has since 1990 been the constituency of Angela Merkel. What locals here call “the silver of the sea” has been a key industry in the region for centuries. Some of the small herring-fishing villages on Rügen’s northernmost tip date back to the 12th century, and the industry blossomed again during the time of the German Democratic Republic, when East Germany’s socialist regime invested heavily in expanding ocean fishing. Franz Plaep, 82, a retired trawler captain, remembers the 1950s as the island’s “golden era”, when Sassnitz harbour was home to 200 vessels that sailed as far as Africa or New York, and fishermen had one of the few profession in the one-party state that knew no borders. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fishing industry on Rügen collapsed with the same speed as many of East Germany’s other state-run industries. In Sassnitz harbour, one company still sells soused, pickled or smoked herring its cutters catch off the island’s coast as a local delicacy in a company-owned shop, but only a small share of the fleet’s catch is exported off the island. A group of fishermen in Rügen’s north-west are hoping to turn tinned herring into a luxury product in the way the Portuguese have managed with sardines, though the scale of their enterprise is even more limited. In the seaside bar where Franz Plaep and his former colleagues meet every morning from 8 til 9 for a coffee, there is a famous photograph on the wall that shows a young Angela Merkel talking to local fishermen in a hut in the village of Lobbe. The photo was taken in 1990, when she was 36 years old. The fisherman’s hut has since shut down, like many others; of about 2,000 fishing businesses that existed on the island in 1990, barely 100 remain. When Dutch multinational Parlevliet & Van der Plas (P&P) built the Euro-Baltic processing plant in 2003, it became a crucial crutch for a regional economy in structural decline. With 140 full-time employees and 80 seasonal contract workers, it is one of the biggest employers on the island. Local authorities had managed to entice P&P to the island with EU grants and by helping to procure scientific permits to reclaim the plot of land from the sea on which the plant now sits. In 2020, however, Brexit is one of two developments threatening to kick the last legs from under Rügen’s remaining fishing industry. Catchment quotas for the Baltic sea, set by Brussels on the advice of maritime scientists, have shrunk dramatically in recent years, down 65% from last year, to 1,700 tonnes. In 2003, fishermen were still allowed to fish 35,000 tones of herring out of the Baltic. The reasons behind the decline of stocks are unclear, with speculative fingers pointed at global warming, noisy sub-aquatic building works around the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and a growing population of hungry seals. “The quota may go up again, of course,” said Uwe Richter. “But when you are at such a low level it may take longer than we can afford to wait.” Processing different fish instead, such as anchovies or red mullet, is not an option – the high-tech machinery inside the plant is tailored towards slender herring. For now, the viability of his business is reliant on access to British waters. “Without them, we run the risk that the plant will be at a standstill for long periods.” Merkel appears to be aware of their plight. In Germany’s federalised political system, delegates are not expected to parade local issues into the business of the Bundestag in the way they are in Westminster. But in her role as environment minister under Helmut Kohl and later as chancellor, Merkel has frequently visited fishermen on the shores of the Baltic Sea, most recently in 2015, when she christened “Mark”, one of the large trawlers in Euro-Baltic’s fleet that could from next year be barred from British waters. The threat posed to the local fishing industry by Britain’s exit from the EU, people on the island say, has been on the chancellor’s mind since the UK voted to leave. Her chief of staff visited Euro-Baltic as soon as Brexit negotiations started in earnest, and in the 2017 coalition treaty between Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic party, the word “Brexit” appears only once – under the chapter heading “Fishing, Angling and Aquaculture”. If there’s still hope in Sassnitz, it’s because there is an expectation that the Brits will come to recognise the absurdity of the situation. One of the quirks of European cuisine is that both Germany and Britain’s culinary habits are not matched to the maritime fauna at its disposal. Herring plays a minor role on British menus, and the cod used for fish and chips is largely caught in waters off Scandinavia. In Germany, meanwhile, herring remains one of the three most popular types of fish on the menu. If British fishermen want to sell the fish in their seas, they will not only need some form of easy access to EU markets, but also trawlers of the size and processing infrastructure of the scale provided by Euro-Baltic. Britain could try to build its own processing capacity, perhaps even buying out large Dutch companies such as P&P or Cornelis Vrolijk that dominate the trade, suggests Rodney Forster, a marine scientist at the University of Hull department. “Could the UK build factory freezer trawlers and processing facilities, and find markets for a large-scale pelagic fishery? Or more likely, could the UK simply buy out P&P and re-flag some of its vessels as UK, and move processing to the UK? Could Grimsby be expanded as a fish processing base?” Financially, that seems possible, he adds. “But would Britain perform such a volte face in industrial policy for such a small sector of the economy? I would be surprised.” For now, Uwe Richter reckons, a no-deal Brexit would be bad news for both herring handlers in the Baltic and the North Sea. “Our worst-case scenario is also the worst-case scenario for British fishermen.”"
"Travel on one of Brighton’s new buses and you could experience a unique innovation in air pollution control. The seaside city has high rates of walking and one of the lowest rates of car ownership in the UK. Bus journeys per resident are second only to London and more than twice those in Merseyside and Manchester. But this has led to air pollution problems where almost all of Brighton’s buses routes (4,000 buses per day) converge in the crowded city centre. To help, 30 new buses are now using geofencing to automatically switch from diesel to battery power when they enter the city’s low emission zone. Other trials with geofencing in Bristol and San Francisco have switched buses to battery power to reduce air pollution near schools and hospitals. Brighton is no stranger to bus innovation. More than 100 years ago, it boasted the UK’s largest fleet of electrobuses. Unlike today’s electric buses, such as the fleet in London, the early Brighton buses did not have time out of service for charging. Instead, after about 40 miles, the buses called briefly at a battery swap station. Despite their reliability and popularity with passengers a lack of spare parts led to their retirement around 1916.

"The dance of lights emanating from fireflies is among the most spectacular nocturnal sights in the natural world but experts have warned certain species may be at risk of extinction. Amid a range of threats, an academic survey of firefly experts from around the world found that habitat loss is considered the heaviest pressure on the insects, which include more than 2,000 species. Pesticide spraying and the use of artificial lights at night are the other leading threats to the creatures, which are in the beetle family. Most firefly species aren’t well documented in terms of populations, with substantial data only existing for a few, such as the common European glowworm and a separate species found in Malaysia. But these records have shown declines, raising concerns that fireflies could be facing the sort of woes that have sparked fears elsewhere of a broader crisis in the insect world. “If people want fireflies around in the future we need to look at this seriously,” said Sara Lewis, a professor of biology at Tufts University in Massachusetts, who led the survey. “Fireflies are incredibly attractive insects, perhaps the most beloved of all insects, because they are so conspicuous, so magical. “They spark wonder in people. When you are in your back yard or park you notice them and are amazed. They are one of the few things that universally give people a feeling of falling in love in nature.” Lewis is leading a team of biologists associated with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature seeking to better understand the challenges faced by fireflies and help safeguard them. “We want to keep fireflies lighting up our nights for a long, long time,” said Sonny Wong of the Malaysian Nature Society, a member of the group. Some fireflies are habitat generalists but others are at particular risk if areas are razed for residential or commercial development. Lewis said the Bethany Beach firefly, found only in a handful of wetlands along Delaware’s Atlantic coast, is an example of a firefly in such peril. “Unfortunately people also like to live on the coast and there’s been tremendous residential development there,” she said. Juvenile fireflies develop underground or in leaf litter, making them vulnerable to insecticides used to target crop pests. Fireflies have also suffered from the explosion in light pollution over the past century, a problem that scientists have warned is driving the decline of other insects, especially moths. On top of their incandescent beauty, fireflies are considered important in the ecosystem, preying upon creatures such as slugs and snails. “They also play a role as a flagship species for insect conservation, because they are so attractive,” said Lewis. “People, certainly in the US, who don’t like insects would say, ‘I love fireflies and I’ll do anything to conserve them.’ We want a world where they are still around. At least with light pollution there’s an easy way to reverse things – you just turn off the lights.”"
"The annual migration of monarch butterflies from the US and Canada is one of the most resplendent sights in the natural world – a rippling orange-and-black wave containing millions of butterflies fluttering instinctively southward to escape the winter cold. The spectacle when they reach their destination in central Mexico is perhaps even more astonishing. Patches of alpine forest turn from green to orange as the monarchs roost in the fir trees, the sheer weight of butterflies causing branches to sag to the point of snapping. Tens of thousands of the insects bounce haphazardly overhead, searching replenishment from nearby plants. To witness this sight is as if to enter a waking dream. “People have a spiritual and emotional connection to monarchs,” said Sonia Altizer, a monarch butterfly researcher at the University of Georgia. “Many people tell me that seeing them was a highlight of their life.” The recent deaths of two butterfly conservationists in the region has, however, drawn attention to a troubling tangle of disputes, resentments and occasional bouts of harrowing violence that has lingered over the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, a sprawling world heritage site situated 60 miles north-west of Mexico City. Mustachioed and gregarious, Homero Gómez González tirelessly promoted the El Rosario sanctuary, a section of the butterfly reserve that receives the bulk of tourists who come from around the world to see the monarchs. He featured in mesmerizing social media videos – posing with butterflies fluttering around him – and called the creatures “a marvel of nature”. Gómez, who was 50, disappeared on 13 January after attending a patron saint festival in the municipality of Ocampo; his body was found two weeks later at the bottom of a watering hole. His death has yet to be ruled a murder, although police say he suffered a blunt trauma to the head. The incident raised fears that gangs, possibly tied to the illegal logging of the butterfly reserve, had targeted Gómez for his advocacy of ecotourism over the felling of trees in this rugged swath of Mexico where communities, often beset by poverty, have traditionally relied upon the harvesting of timber, potatoes and wheat. Those concerns were further heightened this week after the death of a part-time tour guide from another nearby butterfly sanctuary, called Raúl Hernández Romero. His body was found 1 February with injuries possibly inflicted by a sharp object. “The panorama for the community, the forest and the monarch butterflies is now very complicated and uncertain,” Amado Gómez González, one of Gómez’s nine siblings, told the Guardian. “There are now these two crimes and it has spread fear. You find yourself thinking ‘What if this is a group that is coming to try and take the sanctuary away from us?” Investigations into the two deaths are ongoing. But some conservationists fret they are a byproduct of the violence that has long troubled the state of Michoacán, which stretches from the mountains of central Mexico to the west coast. As they have done across the country, organized crime groups linked to the drug trade have diversified into many other activities, including kidnapping, avocado cultivation, land theft – and the lucrative market in pine, fir and cedar wood. Logging is supposedly under tight controls, but high prices mean lumber mafias often stray into protected areas – and are prepared to use violence. “In Michoacán, a tree is worth more than a human life,” said one former state official. “Homero Gómez was in conflict with these loggers,” said Homero Aridjis, an environmentalist and poet, who is a longtime defender of the monarch butterfly sanctuaries. “They’ve always been a very dangerous group because there are always politicians, businessmen involved in deforestation.” Aridjis said his own activism against illegal logging, the planting of avocado orchards and the proposed construction of a mine near the sanctuaries has brought threats. He largely stays away from the butterfly sanctuaries due to security concerns. But others suggest Gómez may have fallen foul of a backlash to his buccaneering self-promotion and questions over his role as the former leader of the El Rosario community, which is run as an ejido – a traditional Mexican collectivist arrangement where residents share ownership of the land and its bounty. “In this system, it’s easy for a leader to become abusive with the community’s income,” said a Michoacán conservationist who was familiar with Gómez and the sanctuary but did not want to be named. The conservationist insisted it was still safe for butterfly guardians to do their work. “He was an outspoken person, he drew a lot of attention to himself. I don’t know why he was killed, but because of the non-transparent management of the ejido he had a lot of enemies. It’s difficult to say this in Mexico because the press has portrayed him nearly as a saint.” Regardless, Amado Gómez’s fears that “large groups” might seize the sanctuary are not without foundation. Criminal groups have already moved in on resources such as water, forests and minerals – most famously in the indigenous Purépecha community of Cherán, where locals rose up in 2011 to halt illegal loggers, backed by a drug cartel, from clearcutting their forests. The demise of Gómez also highlights the misery suffered by Mexico’s beleaguered environmental defenders, who have been murdered with impunity in shocking numbers. Fourteen defenders were murdered in Mexico in 2018, according to Global Witness. Security concerns are rife in the region, and many prefer silence. “It’s very difficult [to speak out], and even more so for those who live here,” said a local researcher, who preferred to remain anonymous. While the reasons for the deaths of the two men have yet to fully emerge, concerns are already swelling that the incidents will hurt tourism. The fragile security situation across Mexico has been blamed for a quiet winter for visitors in one of the major sanctuaries, Sierra Chincua, even before the deaths. The monarch butterflies themselves are also coming under growing pressures. A historic low in overwintering populations was recorded in 2013-14, amid a longer-term slump that has prompted mayors in cities across North America to promise remedial action. It’s suspected that butterfly numbers have been winnowed away by the use of toxic pesticides and razing of critical monarch habitat in the US and Canada. The decline was reversed somewhat last year but scientists warn the annual monarch migration faces an existential threat due to the climate crisis. The oyamel firs preferred by monarchs in Mexico are being stressed by rising temperatures and drought, with predictions the trees will be virtually wiped out by the end of the century. Global heating is also reducing the viability of milkweed, the sole plant where the monarch reproduces, in US and Canada. This trend is set to restrict the butterflies to isolated pockets and end their epic migration to Mexico, a journey that can stretch for 3,000 miles. A separate monarch migration, which brings butterflies to the warmth of coastal California, has shrunk from millions of insects in the 1980s to fewer than 30,000 individuals now. “It’s so obvious that it’s painful,” said Orley Taylor, a biologist and co-founder of Monarch Watch, a group of US volunteers focused on studying and conserving the species. “Within 30 years or so we probably won’t be talking about the monarch migration. We risk losing something very special indeed.” The demise of the overwintering monarchs would send an economic and cultural shock through central Mexico, although there are currently more pressing concerns in a region beset by crime and few economic opportunities. “People are all for protecting the butterflies, but people have to have the necessities to survive,” said Father Martín Cruz Morales, a local priest, on a break from a community lunch of tacos and aguas frescas to celebrate the anniversary of a colleague’s ordination. In El Rosario this week, Gómez’s friends and family packed a billiards hall – emblazoned with the image of Homer Simpson – to pray the novena, or nine days of prayer. Over pastries and hot cups of fruit punch, Amado Gómez remembered his brother, a former logger, as an ambitious but often altruistic man, who graduated from Mexico’s premier agricultural university and mostly worked in government until launching his activism in favour of the monarch butterflies. Homero Gómez led tree-planting initiatives in El Rosario. He also helped organize patrols to protect the forests; teams of 10 persons still head out day and night into the hills to guard against incursions from illegal logging – something that locals say hasn’t occurred in the butterfly reserve for at least two years. “They know that people are organized here and know that it’s difficult to cut down a tree and escape,” Amado Gómez said. “Nobody trusts the local police so they do [security] themselves with sticks, with guns, with whatever they can use themselves.” Altizer, the University of Georgia researcher stressed that she didn’t think the reserve was too dangerous to visit and argued that tourism and conservation efforts should continue as before. “El Rosario has so much to offer tourists, it’s right in the core of the biosphere reserve,” said Altizer. “If you think any place should be safe for monarchs and people it should be there, which makes this shocking. It makes me wonder if this will deter tourists from going there in the future. It sends a worrying message.” She said scientists have long been advised to be cautious in the region, to not drive around at night and to avoid certain areas. A vehicle owned by the WWF had to cover its logo up on a previous visit due to fears of attack. “You see federal police patrolling the forest in military-style vehicles which is a little disconcerting,” she said. “There is drug cartel violence in Michoacán, and if that bleeds over into logging operations I don’t know what the best strategy to combat that is. People in these communities already have to deal with a lot of hardships. It’s difficult to promote ecotourism when logging continues even after the designation of the biosphere reserves.”"
"The tree leans into the light. As the sky darkens, the crown of a black poplar catches the gold of February sunlight. Big old black poplars, Populus nigra, are leaners. They are trees of European floodplain forests and when these leaning towers finally keel over, they grow shoots back up again from the wreckage, which will eventually fall to create new woods. Black poplars are slow walkers of the floodplain, water bailiffs holding the flow in the landscape. This one, growing in the valley of a tributary of the River Severn, is the British subspecies, P nigra betulifolia, the Atlantic race of European black poplars.  The Forestry Commission says there are only 7,000 true black poplars left in Britain. Floodplains are for development, and leaning trees are dangerous; the gnarly old giants, tumbling in slow motion through a world that no longer exists, are anachronisms. The drifts of cotton-woolly seeds that the black poplar produces are not popular – a 1990s survey found someone who blamed them for the failure of his business – which has been one reason why there are so few female trees left. Drainage, river channelling, intensive agriculture, building development, urbanisation, lack of legal protection, depleted genetic diversity, fragmentation of habitat and a shortage of information has the black poplar leaning towards extinction. Since the 19th century, imported hybrids have taken over its commercial viability for forestry plantation. The future for the black poplar is in climate adaptation: conserving flood water and wildlife species. Improvements in DNA testing can sort out the hybrids from the endangered native subspecies, and conservation measures are tied to flood control and pollution filtering in river catchment management.  In the past, the tree was used to treat the “falling sickness” – perhaps because of its less than upright character – and was renowned for its versatile, flame-resistant timber. Its bulk and size made it a landmark, such as the flag-bearing, ceremonial Arbor Tree in Aston on Clun. Irrespective of the uses we put it to, this sudden illumination of a wild, eccentric figure on the streamside reveals an ancient character hiding in plain sight, leaning to the light."
"As we walk northwards from the fishing village of Boulmer, the beach is heaped with waist-deep piles of seaweed. There must have been a recent storm to have thrown up so much debris. A nimble robin picks off tiny insects from this new feast. Sanderlings skitter along on speedy legs, feeding as they go. The waves have deposited large grey boulders, as yet smooth and uncolonised by limpets. Though there’s a cold wind snagging at our clothes, the far-off edge of today’s low tide is lacy and calm. Birds feed across the wide area of exposed rocks and pools: a hunched heron waiting sharp-eyed; cormorants the colour of Whitby jet; vibrant oystercatchers, strikingly black and white. Redshanks strut on bright legs, delving with their black-tipped red beaks. Turnstones work fast, head-butting bladderwrack to snap up crustaceans and molluscs. In a shallow inlet, there are drifts of rusty-headed wigeon. Black-tailed godwits probe wet muddy sand with long bills, their bodies slender and elegant on thin legs. There is motion everywhere we look. The distant sandy-coloured walls of Dunstanburgh Castle are lit by pale sunlight, a ragged wedge sticking out into the North Sea. We meet no other walkers all the way to Howick Haven. The low cliffs around this sheltered bay are topped in a scrub of gorse and bramble. A black redstart perches briefly on a dock seedhead before dropping into long grass, searching for insects or spiders perhaps. In the calm water of the Haven there’s a small raft of goldeneye. Below the north-facing cliff, fresh water bubbles out of level rock to flow away down a narrow channel to the sea. Grainy sand is being churned around in this small erupting cauldron. With its feeling of magic, I’d like to think it was a natural spring. It was, in fact, a geological experiment, an artesian borehole drilled in the 1960s by a team from Newcastle University to prove the succession of strata. Though I know its story, it still seems otherworldly, a feeling amplified by the fluting cry of a curlew as it takes flight over our heads."
"Mike Potts was aware he was at risk of being a victim of crime, he just didn’t think it would happen to him. But Potts is an owner of an increasingly valuable commodity that thieves are targeting with growing sophistication in the US: bees. A booming demand for honeybees for pollination drew Potts, owner of Pottsy’s Pollination in Oregon, to load 400 hives of his bees on trucks and drive them down to California’s agricultural heartland last month. He unloaded them to a holding area just outside Yuba City and returned just a few days later to find 92 hives had been whisked away by thieves. “I pulled in the yard and noticed that there was some stuff missing,” said Potts, who estimated the theft cost him $44,000. Police subsequently pulled over three suspicious beekeepers traveling late at night, to no avail. “I’ve heard that there had been some stealing but didn’t think it would happen to me. It’s frustrating because it’s getting harder and harder to keep bees alive. And then you transport them down and they just get taken.” The theft is the latest in a string of beehive heists, often undertaken at the dead of night using forklifts and trucks. Hives are regularly split open or dismantled, interventions that can kill tens of thousands of the kidnapped bees. The problem has become severe enough in California that certain police officers now specialize in hive crime. “Hive theft has always been an issue but it has definitely increased over the last eight years,” said Rowdy Freeman, a Butte county police officer who is commonly referred to as “bee theft detective”. Freeman has compiled figures showing there was an explosion in California hive thefts in 2016, with 1,695 being taken, compared with 101 in 2015. In 2017, the figure was 1,048 hives. “The number fluctuates but it is definitely something that will continue and that will require resources and advancements in the use of technology to help prevent and deter theft.” The center of beehive thefts is California’s Central Valley, a fertile stretch of agricultural land responsible for about a quarter of all the produce grown in the US. This huge output – of lettuce, grapes, lemons, apricots and more – requires pollination from far more bees than naturally live in the area. The main driver of the demand for honeybees is the almond industry, which has doubled in size over the past two decades. There are currently 1.17m acres of almonds in California that require pollination which, at a standard rate of two beehives an acre, means the industry somehow needs to conjure up 2.34m beehives for a short window of time each February, when almond trees start to blossom. Beekeepers from across the US congregate in the Central Valley in a sort of annual almond jamboree; more than two-thirds of the nation’s commercially managed honeybees sent on trucks to a 50-mile-wide strip of fertile land. Unlike native, wild bees like bumblebees, honeybees are carefully marshaled in hives and are now more valuable as contract pollination workers than as honey producers. But the almond industry’s growth is heightening the demand for more bees at a time when even maintaining current numbers is a struggle. Due to the ravages of deadly mites, diseases and toxic pesticides, beekeepers now typically lose 40% of their colonies each winter, only making these numbers up through splitting hives and using various treatments and supplements to boost reproduction rates. This dynamic – growing demand for pollinators at a time when supply is under pressure – has seen the typical cost of a hive for pollination shoot up, from just $35 a few years ago to $200, and upwards, now. Pollination has become big business, causing some desperate beekeepers, or organized gangs, to be drawn to beehive crime. “Normal people can’t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck,” said Charley Nye, a beekeeper researcher at University of California, Davis. “So it’s a pretty small pool of people that are able to steal them. But the reward is so big that I think it can be tempting to people to do that.” Lloyd Cunniff, who has been involved in beekeeping since he was 13 years old, never intended to bring his bees to the Central Valley, where endless rows of almond trees stretch out across the landscape in almost every direction. But Cunniff, now 59, had seen his third-generation apiary in Montana decimated by colony collapse disorder – a mysterious syndrome where the worker bees vacate a hive en masse – and needed the income. In January 2017, he loaded 488 beehives, each handmade in distinctive pine and cedar, and headed west. Through a trusted intermediary, Cunniff set his hives down to rest in a remote area near a levee. As is typical in the beekeeping world, there were no fences or other security systems to protect them. The next day, amid heavy fog, Cunniff went back to find them. “We had a GPS reading and we drove out there and my hired man said: ‘There’s your turn.’ And I turned in there and I said: ‘This can’t be the right turn.’ And he said: ‘Why?’ I said: ‘Because there’s no bees sitting,’” Cunniff recalled. “And I thought, ‘Uh-oh.’” All 488 boxes had gone, quickly and skillfully loaded on to a truck and spirited away, costing Cunniff not just the $100,000 in pollination fees but also the basis of his livelihood. He wasn’t to know, but he was just one of many victims of a well-orchestrated operation. Not long after the theft, police were called to a scruffy field near Fresno where they saw something akin to bee carnage. Beehives were scattered randomly across the land, some open with their innards torn out, others scratched and daubed in paint. An irate swarm of bees made officers wary of exiting their cars. “It was like a chop shop for bees,” said Andres Solis, a Fresno detective who specializes in agricultural crime. “None of the boxes matched, it was really untidy. And there were a lot of aggressive bees.” Police called in beekeepers who estimated there were 2,500 hives belonging to a variety of legal owners. A nearby man, Pavel Tveretinov, was arrested under suspicion that he was hacking up the hives in order to multiply them and sell them on to needy growers. An alleged accomplice, Vitaliy Yeroshenko, was also arrested and both now face trial. “Victims started coming out of the woodwork after we started putting it out there,” Solis said. “We looked at what we saw and thought none of these beehives belonged to these gentlemen.” The overall number of thefts dropped following the arrests but beekeepers are concerned that the ballooning demand for honeybees is only going to spur further criminal enterprises. The fallout from the ecological crisis in the bee, and wider insect, world is likely to include more and more bee rustlers. “There’s a shortage of bees this year, again,” Cunniff said. “You watch in this next week or two, there’s going to be stealing of bees like crazy down here. “It was just my turn. That’s how I look at it because it happens to somebody every year down here. They’re stealing them all the time. It’s just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.”"
"One of the dive instructors points out two blacktip reef sharks circling a docile green turtle busy grazing on algae. Stingrays of various sizes, colours and shapes pass beneath us. Suddenly, a pod of dolphins appears, swimming over the hard corals. The dive takes place on what appears to be healthy and pristine coral reef surrounding Lady Elliot Island, at the very southern end of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef off Queensland. There are no visible signs of the bleaching that has plagued other parts of the reef for some years, but the government agency responsible for the reef, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, has confirmed that the natural landmark has suffered a third mass coral bleaching episode in five years, describing the damage as “very widespread”. Mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 hit vast areas of the reef. As the rate at which bleaching events hit the world’s biggest reef system increases, scientists, farmers and volunteers across Queensland are trying to do their bit to lessen the impact. Gary Spotswood is a third-generation farmer at Mt Alma Organics, an organic farm a couple of hours drive from Townsville, a city on the north-eastern coast of Queensland. Spotswood has installed pumps to accumulate the run-off on his 430 acres, which then filters through aquatic plants growing in the adjacent wetlands. The project is partly funded by a grant from the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, which was awarded a controversial A$444m (£217m) from the Australian government to sponsor projects on the reef. “I try to keep as much water on the land as possible,” says Spotswood, who leads courses in land use for other farmers and graziers. “Changes take time. But in five years people have changed their habits in how they use the land,” he says. At Townsville’s tropical marine research centre, scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) are looking at how so-called super corals (corals that can resist increased water temperatures) could be used to save the reefs. About 25 strains of coral are being crossbred with the same or different species. The research is being carried out in the National Sea Simulator, the world’s most advanced research aquarium, and intends to show that young coral offspring – produced from mixing corals from various parts of the reef – can survive in warmer sea temperatures. “It’s like crossbreeding corn. We do the same thing with the corals, so they can withstand higher temperatures,” says Kate Quigley, a researcher on reef restoration at Aims. The method is called “assisted gene flow”, and although at an early stage, shows encouraging results in the sea simulator, as well as on the reef – where cross-fertilised corals have been transplanted. The hybrids have one parent from the northern parts and one parent from the central reefs, and the results show that corals with at least one parent from the more heat-resistant northern reefs survive when placed in cooler environments. The research has also confirmed that the offspring inherit heat tolerance from their northern parents, and these genes may ultimately be passed on to make reefs more heat resistant. Aims also conducts research on how to decrease the numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish (cots), which prey upon corals. There are currently more than five million cots on the reefs between Cairns and Cooktown, and the invasion spreads south as the heavily spined species (which normally range from 25–35cm across, and can have up to 23 arms) devours corals and leaves nothing but traces of fine calcium carbonate.  Female cots can produce up to 50 million eggs a year and each one annually ingests 10 square metres of coral. Rising sea temperatures and increased availability of nutrients due to run-off from farming practices are said to be behind the rise in cot numbers. So far divers have culled about half a million by injecting the starfish with white vinegar. Scientists at Aims are attempting to wield another – more natural weapon – to combat the mass outbreak. They breed the rare giant triton, a large marine snail that feeds on cots. The scientists aim to reintroduce the snails on reefs – from where they have disappeared.  The climate crisis and evidence of another mass bleaching, however, continue to overshadow any sign of progress. Quigley says hundreds of studies point in the same direction. “They are showing that climate change is the biggest threat against the reef,” she says. “We don’t know what the future reefs look like. But we need to mitigate the effects that climate change has on the corals.”"
"He has been called a diva and pretentious, and there are even those who don’t like his acting – but never before has Joaquin Phoenix been accused of causing mental health problems for British livestock farmers. On Tuesday, the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) president, Minette Batters, changed all that, opening a new front against the US actor by claiming that he and other celebrity campaigners for veganism had played a part in demonising the UK’s meat producers and doing “enormous damage” to their wellbeing. Days after the Joker actor’s Oscars speech attacking the meat industry, Batters said farmers fearing the imminent loss of their livelihoods and family holdings were in a state of stress and anxiety. Asked at the union’s annual conference who she thought was driving the view that meat was bad and plants were good, she said: “A lot of people who seem to hit the red carpet at the Bafta awards.” She added: “Celebrities have to be careful [because] there are real-life consequences for others … Joaquin Phoenix, he’s had a really challenging life, and you really feel for him and a lot of the things he was saying, but he has to remember there are people at the end of this, there are small family farms and they get hurt too.” Her comments were immediately criticised by vegan and animal rights groups, who accused Batters of making claims without evidence and ignoring the ethical problems posed by meat production. “Veganism is something of an easy target at the moment and I’m not sure that we are the cause of farmer’s problems,” said a spokesperson for the Vegan Society. “There are many causes of mental health issues and stress in farming and I haven’t seen evidence, a piece of research, showing that veganism is one of them.” Phoenix, who has been a vegan since he was three, made a plea for tolerance and equality in his acceptance speech for the best actor award at the Oscars, saying no race, gender or species had rights over another. “I think we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world,” he said. “We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakeable. Then we take her milk that’s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.” Veganism continues to grow in popularity in the UK, with supermarkets clearing shelf space for plant-based ready meals, and meat-free dining in restaurants and pubs now commonplace. Other celebrities who have spoken about the health benefits of plant-based diets are Benedict Cumberbatch, Ellie Goulding and Beyoncé, with their support credited with aiding a rise in veganism’s popularity. Batters said she was not saying “veganism is wrong”, but argued that the debate around animal products had become so binary that meat was being put in the same category as tobacco. “I remember the interview I did with Evan Davis on PM to talk about the government’s new food strategy and he said: ‘Is eating meat the new smoking?’ He compared us with the tobacco industry and you think, ‘Whoa, just think about all of this’.” But the Vegan Society questioned whether its members were really so influential, pointing out that the total number of vegans in the UK was still only 600,000, and saying: “The fact is 99% of the population are still eating animal products. There might be a lot more meat reducers, but this is not an industry that has been threatened by veganism.”  Dawn Carr, the director of vegan corporate projects at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), said farmers were not the only ones feeling anxious. “We can’t turn a blind eye to the visible fear and distress shown by animals raised for their flesh, milk and eggs,” she said. “They have no choice, but farmers do: instead of sending sentient animals to slaughter, they can sow oats or soya beans or grow vegetables, grains, nuts or fruits instead, depending on the quality of their land.” Batters called for kindness to be shown to farmers and an understanding that they were “human” too. “It’s very polarised and it’s doing enormous damage to the mental health of livestock farmers,” she said. “It’s just about instilling this philosophy and being kind and farmers need – we all need – to think that too … in this world of social media, we just need to take a step back sometimes.”"
"The government must act urgently to stamp out the “curse” of single-use plastic sachets, billions of which are helping to fuel the global plastics crisis, campaigners are warning. A coalition of more than 50 business leaders, politicians and campaigners is demanding that the plastic sachets – used for everything from ketchup to shampoo – be included in European and UK legislation outlawing other “throwaway” items such as plastic straws and cotton buds. Its findings, published on Wednesday, reveal that 855bn sachets are used every year globally – enough to cover the entire surface of the Earth – and with many thrown away without being opened. Despite this, sachets have been almost entirely exempt from the broader crackdown on plastic, the campaigners say in an open letter sent to UK newspapers. Sachets are not covered by the EU single-use plastics directive, which is to outlaw a host of throwaway items by 2021. When Michael Gove was environment secretary, the government announced bans on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds in England, which will take effect in April. The environment bill 2020, introduced to parliament this month and due for its second reading on Wednesday, seeks to introduce charges for single-use plastic items but fails to regulate sachets. Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet, which is leading the campaign, said: “In recent years governments and business have gone all out to enforce a ban on plastic straws, cotton buds and even bags. “And yet the plastic sachet, the ultimate symbol of our grab and go, convenience-addicted lifestyle, has been virtually invisible to all. The result? Our Earth is saturated with these uncollectable, unrecyclable, contaminated, valueless little packets. It’s time to close the legal loophole. Now more than ever before we have to sack the sachet.” The letter has been signed by global campaigners including the UN secretary general’s special envoy for the ocean, Peter Thomson, business leaders such as Iceland Foods’ managing director, Richard Walker, the Time Out group chief executive, Julio Bruno, and the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt. Virtually never recycled, plastic sachets are typically used to package single-serve portions of liquids and sauces such as ketchup, vinegar and mayonnaise, and are also popular for hand wipes, shampoo, washing powder and face creams.  In an attempt to find an alternative, the UK’s Just Eat chain has recently teamed up with Unilever to pilot Hellmann’s sauces packaged in seaweed-based sachets."
"New figures reveal that the number of large industrial-sized pig and chicken farms in the UK continues to rise, with close to 2,000 across the country. In 2017, the then environment secretary Michael Gove told MPs: “One thing is clear: I do not want to see, and we will not have, US-style farming in this country.” However, the number of industrial-sized pig and poultry units in the UK has risen by 7% from 1,669 in 2017 to 1,786 this year. Chicken farms are classed as “intensive” if they have capacity to house at least 40,000 poultry birds, while pig farms must have 2,000 pigs raised for meat or 750 breeding sows. Intensive pig and poultry facilities require a permit from the Environment Agency to operate, which is not the case at present for intensive beef and dairy units, so their numbers are not monitored.In England alone, according to 2020 data obtained by the Guardian and Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the number of permitted intensive livestock facilities in England has risen 7% since 2017 to 1,313 as of February this year. Of these, 1,092 are poultry and 221 are pig units, up from 1,016 and 210 respectively. Scotland has seen a rise of 10% and Wales has seen the highest rise, up 21% since 2017. Northern Ireland’s figures have not shown any increase.There is concern that Brexit and new trade deals might further fuel intensification if farmers are forced to stay competitive in the face of cheap, low-welfare imports. At present, the new agriculture bill offers no legal guarantees to prevent this. Driven in part by supermarket pressure to keep prices low and consumer demand for cheap meat, the growth of industrial farming remains divisive.Intensive pig and poultry farms have been linked to local biodiversity damage from ammonia emissions and to detrimental impacts on local communities including noise pollution, increased traffic, and potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and air pollutants. It is also seen as a driver of deforestation in South America, through its reliance on protein-rich crops such as soya as animal feed. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The UK has some of the highest animal welfare and environmental standards in the world. This means all livestock farms, regardless of their size or scale, must meet our high standards and comply with robust legislation.”However, animal welfare charities say 70% of UK farm animals, more than 1 billion animals every year, are now kept in intensive indoor units that Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion in World Farming calls “the biggest cause of animal cruelty in Britain today”. Chicken is our most popular meat, with 20 million birds slaughtered every week in the UK. The vast majority (86%) of industrial-sized farms are in the poultry sector, with 1,534 industrial-sized farms. Previous research from 2017 found seven out of the 10 largest farms in the UK housed more than 1 million birds. But large-scale and intensive methods of farming poultry with high stocking densities and fast-growing breeds have been linked to poor animal welfare. Chickens are bred to grow four times faster than in the 1950s – taking  35–45 days to reach a target slaughter weight of 2–2.5kgs. Almost one-third of intensively reared broiler chickens in the UK develop heart and lung problems. And more than half of the birds in flocks with fast-growing breeds have severe walking problems, with many suffering from lesions on their feet through sitting in their own waste.  The intensification of the poultry sector has also generated local conflict with units often built in regional clusters surrounding slaughterhouses and factories. The Cluck Off campaign in Rushden, Northamptonshire, is fighting Bedfordia’s proposal for a six-shed unit for 314,000 birds, while in Horham and Southolt, Suffolk, locals are trying to stop Epigs Ltd’s plans for 12 poultry houses producing 800,000 chickens every eight weeks. The National Farmers’ Union says farm size is not the critical factor in dictating the welfare of birds. “It is crucial we recognise that animal husbandry and stockmanship are the greatest factors that determine animal health and welfare, not farm size or system of production,” said its chief poultry adviser, Gary Ford.  While outdoor production accounts for 40% of the UK pig industry, the majority of UK pig farming is now intensive with 60% of sows and almost all fattening pigs kept indoors in concrete or slatted floor pens – entitled to one square metre of space each.In the pig sector, there are 252 industrial indoor units in the UK, up 5% since 2017. Previous research from 2017 found the largest then could hold 23,000 pigs. Abnormal behaviour such as tail biting is common  in intensive pig units but can be reduced by providing adequate enrichment such as straw. However, more than 70% of pigs in the UK have their tails cut off to mitigate tail biting and stress aggression. Around 60% of sows give birth while confined in a farrowing crate. The government recently rejected attempts to outlaw the use of farrowing crates despite their adverse impact on sow welfare, inducing repetitive stress behaviours such as bar biting. The National Pig Association states that the production system doesn’t dictate animal welfare and it’s the treatment of individual animals that is important. A spokesperson said: “The primary purpose of the farrowing crate is to prevent the sow from rolling on and crushing her piglets (due to the sow being about 150 times the size of the piglets). The crate also enables stockpersons to work easily and safely around the sow and her piglets, during a time when sows can be particularly aggressive.” Philip Lymbery of Compassion in World Farming hopes that Brexit will lead to a new policy direction, supported by political and public pressure: “We’re at a crossroads and have an opportunity to reinvent British food and farming. We can move towards a thriving countryside where farm animals are restored to the land.”"
"Tens of thousands of families who bought new homes in flood-risk areas are facing “crippling” financial costs, as they are ineligible for cover under a government-backed insurance scheme, a study has found. Research by the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue found that 70,000 homes had been built on land at the highest risk of flooding in England since 2009, including 20,000 that were not protected by flood defences. Homes built after 1 January 2009 are not eligible for insurance under Flood Re, a government scheme launched in 2015 with the aim that about 350,000 homeowners would have access to affordable cover. However, the scheme has been criticised – not least because tens of thousands of people who bought new homes in flood-prone areas in the past decade are not covered. The government ordered a review into flood insurance following the storms over Christmas. The study found that about £31bn worth of properties had been built after 2008 on land in England at the highest risk of flooding. The vast majority of these properties are protected by the Thames Barrier in London, it said, although £5bn worth of buildings remain unprotected. Of the 70,000 new homes built in these at-risk areas since 2008, 20,000 are not protected by flood defences. Lincolnshire had the greatest concentration of undefended at-risk homes, according to the report. The thinktank said the government had not done enough to inform new-build homebuyers of their flood risk over the past decade and should step in to help. Helen Jackson, the author of the report, said: “Government policy over the past decade has seen individuals as entirely responsible for finding out their flood risk, but obviously many are simply not aware. “Many of those seeing their communities deal with flooding would view this onus on them as individuals to have understood how flooding could affect them as a bit heartless.” The National Planning Policy Framework, which guides local planners on the government’s housebuilding policies, states that “inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding should be avoided” by directing development away from areas at highest risk. It adds that where development is necessary, it should be “made safe for its lifetime without increasing flood risk elsewhere”. However, experts say that any housebuilding on high-flood-risk land risks exacerbating the problem elsewhere because it involves paving over green space that would otherwise help soak up rainwater. A government spokesperson said: “Local authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need and have the final say on planning permissions for new developments. However, flooding risk should always be a consideration to ensure building takes place where this risk is lowest. “Where development in a risk area is absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding. “To better understand if some households are not receiving sufficient insurance cover, we have announced an investigation into this issue.”"

"A new investigation has linked the world’s biggest meat company JBS, and its rival Marfrig, to a farm whose owner is implicated in one of the most brutal Amazonian massacres in recent memory. The report by Repórter Brasil comes as JBS faces growing pressure over transparency failings in its Amazon cattle supply chain. On 19 April 2017, nine men were brutally murdered in what became known as the “Colniza massacre”. The men had been squatting on remote forest land in the state of Mato Grosso when their bodies were found, according to court documents. Some showed signs of torture; some had been stabbed, others shot. According to charges filed by state prosecutors in Mato Grosso, the massacre was carried out by a gang known as “the hooded ones”. The aim, they said, was to terrify locals, take over land they lived on and extract valuable natural resources. The first reporter to reach the lawless, far-flung region only got there a week later. On 15 May 2017, prosecutors said they had charged Valdelir João de Souza, a farmer who owned two timber companies on neighbouring land, and four others with homicide and forming or being part of an illegal paramilitary group. Prosecutors said de Souza had ordered the massacre, although he had not been present when it occurred.  Since then de Souza has been a fugitive. But in April 2018 two adjacent areas of land – Três Lagoas and Piracama farms - in nearby Rondônia state were registered under his name (one of the oddities of the Brazilian property system is that landowners register their own land and boundaries). The two farms covered 1,052 hectares (2,599 acres) in an area set aside by the government for low-income agricultural workers. Satellite images show extensive deforestation on the Três Lagoas farm in 2015.  Government sanitary records seen by Repórter Brasil show that on 9 May 2018 143 cattle were sold by the Três Lagoas and Piracama farms to a farm owned by Maurício Narde. Minutes later Narde’s farm sold 143 animals of the same sex and age – 80 female cattle between 13– 24 months old and 63 female cattle over 36 months old – to a JBS meatpacker. In June 2017, according to court documents in a separate case, Narde worked at a sawmill owned by de Souza in Machadinho d’Oeste in Rondônia state. He still works at the same sawmill, although it has since changed its name and is no longer controlled by de Souza. Reached by telephone by the Guardian, Narde confirmed the transaction but did not explain why he had sold the cattle after buying them minutes beforehand.“We buy and sell, just to keep things moving,” he said, before deciding not to answer any more questions and concluding the interview. The quick sale of the cattle suggests what environmentalists call “cattle laundering” – when cattle from a farm that has environmental issues sells cattle to a “clean” farm. This gets around monitoring systems because meat companies including JBS do not monitor these “indirect suppliers”. “This series of coincidences suggests a common practice, which is the triangulation of animals,” said Mauro Armelin, director of Friends of the Earth Brazil. “It is a practice that could indicate cattle laundering.” On 25 June 2018, according to government sanitary records, Três Lagoas also sold 153 head of cattle to the Morro Alto farm in Monte Negro, Rondônia, owned by José Carlos de Albuquerque. In the following months de Albuquerque sold dozens of head of cattle to JBS and Marfrig slaughterhouses. De Albuquerque told Réporter Brasil that the sale had never been completed – but the report cited sanitary records showing the cattle had, in fact, entered the Morro Alto farm. Contacted by the Guardian by phone and email, he declined to answer questions. The Repórter Brasil investigation highlights the difficulties that Brazil’s big meat companies have in monitoring their supply chains. JBS and other big companies such as Marfrig committed to not buying from farms involved in illegal deforestation in two separate agreements signed with Greenpeace and Brazilian prosecutors in 2009 and subsequent years. Under the Greenpeace deal, the companies also promised to remove producers accused of land grabbing or convicted in rural conflicts from their suppliers lists. The deal with federal prosecutors similarly bans farms that have been convicted of involvement in rural conflicts, or that are being investigated. Greenpeace quit their deal in 2017, after JBS was fined for buying cattle from farms in illegally-deforested areas in the Amazon state of Pará. An audit by federal prosecutors found that 19% of the cattle JBS purchased in the state in 2016 had “evidence of irregularities”. In the years following the cattle agreement, JBS made enormous progress in improving its monitoring of Amazon suppliers and the company defended its sustainability in a statement. “We monitor over 280,000 square miles, an area larger than Germany, and assess more than 50,000 potential cattle-supplying farms every day, as well as conducting daily checks of all purchases to ensure compliance with strict standards. To date we have blocked more than 8,000 cattle-supplying farms due to noncompliance,” it said. But while the company now has a complex system in place to monitor its direct suppliers, it is still unable to monitor its indirect suppliers – those farmers who sell to farms that then sell on to JBS. De Souza’s case has yet to be concluded. Ulisses Rabaneda, a lawyer representing de Souza, told the Guardian that he had decided not to reply to questions from the media at this stage in the court proceedings.  In an interview with the Gazeta Digital in 2019, de Souza said he was innocent of all charges, had never been involved in death squads, and remained a fugitive because he was scared he would be murdered by the real killers if he handed himself in. “I never went around armed, so why at my age of 41, with solid companies, a peaceful life, no debts, without any problems, would I do something so barbaric?” de Souza said in the interview. “I built everything with the honesty and effort of my family. Why would I throw it all away?” JBS told Réporter Brasil that de Souza was not a supplier and that it does not “acquire cattle from farms involved in deforestation of native forests, invasion of indigenous reserves of conservation, rural violence, land conflicts, or that used slave or child labour”. “JBS reiterates that any attempt to link the company to the person mentioned in the report, who was never on its list of suppliers, is irresponsible,” the company told the Guardian. Marfrig declined to comment on the investigation and sent the statement it had previously sent to the Guardian in December in which the company recognised that 53% of its Amazon cattle comes from indirect suppliers. “Marfrig is fully aware of the challenges related to the livestock production chain and recognises its role as an important transformation agent to ensure production vis-à-vis the conservation of Brazilian biomes, especially the Amazon,” the company said.  It detailed measures including a supplier monitoring platform and its Request for Information (RFI) tool, in which suppliers voluntarily list the farms they may have acquired animals from. The company says a third of the cattle it sources in the Amazon come with an RFI, and it is now working to improve the process with World Wildlife Fund. In 2017, a Greenpeace report published after the Colniza massacre said a company owned by de Souza, called Madeireira Cedroarana, had accumulated around $150,000 (£116,000) in unpaid fines over a decade from Brazil’s environment agency, Ibama. Between January 2016 and October 2017 the company exported thousands of cubic metres of timber to the US and Europe. In 2018 it changed its name to Colmar Madeiras; it continues at the same address, but de Souza is no longer its controlling partner. In the interview with Gazeta Digital, he said his company had challenged fines it had received."

"The Great Barrier Reef has experienced a third mass coral bleaching event in five years, according to the scientist carrying out aerial surveys over hundreds of individual reefs. With three days of a nine-day survey to go, Prof Terry Hughes told Guardian Australia: “We know this is a mass bleaching event and it’s a severe one.” It follows the worst outbreaks of mass bleaching on record killing about half the shallow water corals on the world’s biggest reef system in 2016 and 2017. Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University and one of the world’s leading authorities on bleaching and the Great Barrier Reef, said: “We know enough now that [the bleaching] is more severe than in 1998 and 2002. How it sits with 2016 and 2017 we are not sure yet.” He said a fuller picture would be possible after the final three days of surveying. “They are crucial,” he said. Working with a staff member from government agency the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), Hughes has assessed bleaching levels on 682 reefs from a spotter plane flying at about 500 feet.  Global heating caused by escalating atmospheric greenhouse gases is a major threat to the world’s coral reef ecosystems. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the published evidence suggested a majority of tropical coral reefs would disappear even if heating was limited to 1.5C and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. The globe has warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution. Not all bleached corals die. Corals bleach when they sit in waters that are unusually hot for too long. They can recover if temperatures fall, but are often killed when high temperatures are sustained. Hughes said the first four days of aerial surveys last week covered almost 500 reefs from the Torres Strait to Cairns. They revealed a mixed picture, with some severe bleaching on reefs closer to shore, but outer “ribbon reefs” in the far north escaping damage. He said surveys this week in the central parts of the reef had found extensive bleaching at levels “comparable to 2017”, when it is estimated about 22% of shallow water coral along the reef’s 2300km died. Hughes said about 80 reefs between Tully and Townsville were badly bleached. Both inner and outer reefs were hit. “We could see that some of those corals were big enough that they must have survived the 2017 bleaching and now they re-bleached,” he said. In more positive news, he said popular tourist spots between Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands had not been badly affected and would likely recover from mild bleaching. But some juvenile corals “about the size of dinner plates” had bleached in the central part of the reef, which he said would affect the pace at which the area recovered from previous bleaching events. Hughes said he was worried about corals in areas yet to be surveyed in the south. Those reefs had higher proportions of corals that were more susceptible to bleaching. “If they do bleach severely, we will see significant losses,” he said. In 2016 and 2017, there was no severe bleaching south of Hydrographers Passage, a natural shipping channel north-east of Mackay. Hughes said by late Tuesday they had surveyed about 10 reefs south of the passage and found all were severely bleached. Further south, at Heron Island, near Gladstone, researchers from the University of New South Wales have been monitoring bleaching since January. Associate Prof Tracey Ainsworth, from the centre for marine science and innovation, said shallow reefs around the island had “really suffered” after being left untouched in 2016 and 2017. “This is the year that the southern Great Barrier Reef has taken a bit of a hit,” she said. Ainsworth said reefs in deeper water had been less affected, but there had been near 100% impact in shallow lagoon areas that were exposed, or close to exposed, at low tide. “Pretty much everything [in the shallows] is bleached. There wasn’t a lot of difference between the species and there is quite a lot of mortality,” she said. While they were spared in 2016 and 2017, it is not the first time the reefs at Heron Island have bleached. They were significantly affected during localised bleaching in 2011. “I’ve been working on these shallows of nearly 20 years so it’s a real shame to see this coral bleaching… but it has been a relief to see it hasn’t affected all of the reef,” Ainsworth said. Hughes’ surveying team was preparing on Wednesday to fly from Mackay to observe about 200 reefs that make up the Swain and Pompey reef groups. On Thursday, they will fly over the Capricorn Bunker Group that includes the Heron Island research station. They will return to Mackay on Friday, taking a track farther offshore. Richard Leck, head of oceans at environment group WWF Australia, said the bleaching had hit Heron Island and surrounding areas when they had been “looking the best they had in decades”. “It’s really worrying,” he said. Leck said the GBRMPA had said limiting warming to 1.5C was the only hope for a safe outcome for the reef, but the federal government’s climate targets were consistent with double that. “We need a target for 1.5C and a realistic plan to get there,” he said. A five-yearly report by the major marine park authority last year found the reef’s outlook had deteriorated from poor to very poor, and warned the window of opportunity to improve its future was “now”. The latest mass bleaching comes as Unesco’s world heritage committee is scheduled to assess the reef’s status this year. It is the first time the committee will have considered the natural wonder’s world heritage status since the back-to-back bleaching events. It comes during an ongoing debate over how countries should manage the impact of the climate crisis on world heritage sites. It is unclear what the coronavirus pandemic will mean for Unesco’s meetings."
"I say it a lot, but don’t take my own advice enough. Experiencing nature is about slowing down – stopping, in fact. The stiller you stay, the more you see. Nature confides when you’re not blundering through it. But that’s only half the story. The rest is attention. It takes mental effort to stand, orient, step and not fall on your face. Backroom brainwork for sure, but it still absorbs neural capacity, and so the best way to see is to sit. The bench under the kitchen window is as good a place for this as I know. Three metres from the bird feeder, a bed of overgrown lavender and rosemary, a backdrop of grass too scruffy to be called a lawn and a wooded slope that limits the horizon to less than 100 metres. We’re lucky, I know it. In this space, if need be, we can exercise the dog and ourselves. We can feel the sun, listen to the birds, sniff the wind without fearing what the air might contain. I settle. The dog dozes at my feet. In the dense matrix of rosemary stems I notice an ancient football we thought we’d lost, then furtive movements of dunnocks and a chaffinch, picking at spilt birdseed. A wren peeks. Robin sings. Long-tailed, coal and willow tits return to the feeder and tree sparrows skirr past in a small, hectic squadron. A blue tit alights on the wall of the house and begins inspecting every cranny in the stonework, pausing every second to check its surroundings with eyes black and bright as thought itself. Peer and scan, peer and scan. There’s another movement in the rosemary and I realise a young rabbit has been there all along – less than a collie’s standing-leap from the dog’s snoozing muzzle. They are all stay-at-homes, I realise. Despite wings and swift feet, their lives will likely be lived wholly in the arena I can see now. They notice the overhead trajectories of crows, wood pigeons and buzzards the way I register a passing helicopter, clueless as to where it came from or where it might be going. For these little homebodies, this horizon is all there is. And I’m reassured it can be enough."
"It landed with the lightest of pressure, toes thin as fuse wire splayed on my outstretched fingers. With eyes closed, one might have mistaken the weight for the touch of falling raindrops. There, on my upturned hand, a robin – my friendly garden robin. Dark pupils watched me as it tucked in to the seed mix on my palm, picking sunflower kernels from the pile one at a time. It was in no hurry. In the past I have hand-fed robins that grab and dash, but this one steps forward to the centre of my palm and calmly eats its fill before heading off. Back in December this individual made itself known as I topped up the bird table, perching on the wooden slats almost as soon as I laid out dawn offerings. I felt sure I could forge a closer bond. By nature, robins shadow animals that disturb the soil and expose invertebrates – whether wild boar or gardeners – so are one of our most approachable birds. It took a fortnight to win its confidence. At first I rested my hand next to the seed as it fed on the table. Once it became used to this, I filled my palm with titbits, from which it snatched the odd morsel. Finally, the only food to be had was that which I held out – and following a few nervous flypasts, it plucked up courage and alighted. Now this bold little companion waits for me to come, and is on my hand and eating within seconds, its chest as bright as a segment of clementine, its back a warm brown. Although the sexes look alike and both sing through the winter, it is the males that become lead vocalists during the breeding season. Now spring is here, I feel certain mine is a male as he floods the air with rich refrains. One morning he paused while feeding to listen to a distant rival, puffed up his chest in territorial defiance and burst into song. Throat quivering, cascades of sweet notes poured from his gaping beak, my fingers his songpost. It was worth all the daily deliveries for this special honour – the enchanting moment a wild bird sang from my hand."
"Looking at a map is travelling of a strange sort. A way of getting outside, without going outside. Of exploring while still. Where you can visualise the roll and tumble of land, and its vertical space, on something entirely flat. Where the tiniest twitch of gaze can leap miles. And decades. On the National Library of Scotland’s website you can time travel through maps. Go back, and back, and civilisation falls off these sheets like loosened scales. From a screen of pixels, shades of paper and shifts in typeface immediately evoke the smell and scratch of a mapmaker’s tools, separated from you by nothing but a dozen decades or so. I wanted to see how long a wood outside my town, one I’d always thought striking, has been there. A 1905 map shows it, and also that it was once a quarry. I print the map to go and look. The wood is castle-like, moated by a wide belt of grass and surrounded on all horizons by houses. And the things not on any map: traffic noise, the glow of a petrol station sign. And birds. The wood is saturated with bird sound, and the thickety noise of unseen life. I see little of it: crows, like apostrophes in the canopy; a young rabbit fleeing through sharp undergrowth. Inside, it is dense and close, resplendent with growth unchecked. Purple buds stud the ground with colour. It’s hilly, steeply so: dug out, and reclaimed. Pathways through it suggest humans – trees bent into arches, firepits, one odd little hovel. Someone’s home? The hard lines of a phone mast mingle with the branch-scrabble above. A landscape shaped by people, left to nature, but still peopled. I stand still, and close my eyes. Time is gone, and all I hear is the birds. Home, but first a detour through a residential close, to see the site of something on the old map: a hospital for infectious diseases, complete with the oddly specific “smallpox huts”. I wonder if the people inside these houses know. Not so long ago, that might have seemed archaic and alien. Times do change. But though disconnected, sometimes they bend together and touch unexpectedly, like an untidy fold in a map."
"The cancellation of a series of cross-country running races in West Yorkshire because of coronavirus has apparently saved hundreds of migrating toads from being squashed underfoot. A toad protection group said hundreds of the amphibians have been trampled by fell runners in previous years. The popular races take place close to a pond where the toads mate, the group said. The races, known as “bunny runs”, are hosted by the Wharfedale Harriers and had been due to take place in April during the evening.  Sue Patchett, leader of the Riddlesden Toad Patrol, said many toads have been trampled underfoot in previous years. She had been recruiting new marshals to help rescue vulnerable toads during this year’s run. Patchett has done toad patrolling in Riddlesden for 15 years. “I used to do it by myself but five years ago I formed a group and there’s now approximately 10 to 15 of us,” she said. “Every spring when darkness falls, hundreds of toads embark on their migration down from gardens on the hillside in Riddlesden and they head downwards towards the canal. “Many are killed and injured on the streets but we’re dedicated to helping by going out with torches and buckets to collect up as many toads as we can find and we release them by their breeding ground. We can save over 1,000 toads in season.” Patchett blames the annual bunny runs for hundreds of toads being trampled and killed.  But Steve Milner from the Wharfedale Warriors, who helps to plan and organise the runs, said: “I haven’t ever seen any evidence of it, of toads being trampled. “I’ve spoken to a lot of people from the race and no one has ever said they’ve seen anything. The location is also a very popular place where people walk as well.” Resident Jo Edwards, however, said she saw hundreds of dead toads while walking close to the pond the morning after one of the bunny runs. “We witnessed dozens and dozens and dozens of trampled toads,” she said. “They were either dead or still dying and they all had their innards spilling out. There were so many of them. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see.” Edwards has, in the past, taken part in the bunny runs and says the “fast and furious” route often leads to runners using the path closest to the pond where the toads congregate. “The ground’s uneven and it’s rocky,” she said. “When you’re running, it’s hard to avoid things – you’ve just to place your feet where they land.” Patchett has asked Bradford council if the location of the runs can be changed. A council spokesperson said: “These races have run for many years and this is the first time we’ve been approached about the issue.” At the time, the council granted permission for the evening runs to take place as long as they were rerouted. Milner said the Wharfedale Harriers made plans to adjust the route but Patchett said the best solution would be for the runs to be held during the daytime or later in the year."
"At least 80% of the Blue Mountains world heritage area and more than 50% of the Gondwana world heritage rainforests have burned in Australia’s ongoing bushfire crisis. The scale of the disaster is such that it could affect the diversity of eucalypts for which the Blue Mountains world heritage area is recognised, said John Merson, the executive director of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Institute. The data is based on a Guardian Australia analysis of areas burned in New South Wales and Queensland and was confirmed by the NSW government. Guardian Australia reported in December that 20% of the Blue Mountains world heritage area had been affected by fire in the early months of the crisis. Four times that amount has now burned in what Merson said were fires of a scale that “has never happened before”. “This is totally, totally unique. As everybody keeps saying, it’s unprecedented,” he said. The Blue Mountains world heritage area covers one million hectares of national park and bushland and is dominated by temperate eucalypt forest. The area is renowned for the diversity of its vegetation and is home to about a third of the world’s eucalypt species. While most are fire-adapted and can regenerate, many of the species depend on long intervals between fires, Merson said. “We had a very large fire in 2013. It’s only six years after that,” he said. “The eucalypts can be very badly reduced in diversity if fires come through in too short and intense intervals. Their numbers will virtually collapse.” He said the full impact on tree species and wildlife would not be known until more assessments were done as fire grounds became accessible. But there are concerns about the effect on breeding and feeding habitats for species including the spotted-tail quoll and the brush-tailed rock-wallaby. The fires have also burnt swamp communities that release water slowly and are important water resources. They flow into streams that feed into Sydney’s water supply and provide water for wildlife. It was revealed this week that a rescue mission by NSW fire crews was able to save the only known natural grove of Wollemi pines, so-called “dinosaur trees” that fossil records show existed up to 200m years ago. Merson said the fires had entered areas that had not burnt previously and the need for the rescue mission was indicative of the intensity of the fires in the region. “This is climate change in its most fundamental form,” he said. “This is right in our face. We’re living it.” Further north, the fires have devastated parts of the Gondwana rainforest world heritage area, a collection of reserves of subtropical rainforest that span 366,500 hectares across NSW and Queensland. Guardian Australia used newly released data which combines all burned areas in NSW and Queensland since 1 July 2019, and calculated the area of overlap with world heritage areas. This analysis shows 53% of the Gondwana rainforest area has burned. Guardian Australia spoke to Mark Graham, an ecologist with the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, in December. Graham is based in the Bellinger Valley near some of these fires. He said since December there had been “significant, additional fire in areas that hadn’t burned” in Barrington Tops, and that most of the Gondwana areas have taken a “massive hit”. “It’s heart-wrenching. It’s disturbing. It’s frightening.” Graham said his area had experienced some rain in recent weeks but there were now concerns that sediment washed into the Bellinger River has affected the food sources for the critically endangered Bellinger River snapping turtle. A spokesman for the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment said understanding the impact of the fires on both world heritage areas was a priority. “Analysis will improve as the forests becomes safe to enter and the smoke clears, enabling accurate satellite and aerial imagery to help guide our assessment and on work on ground,” he said. He said both regions contained a mixture of forest types, some of which was adapted for fire, but others that were more sensitive to fire, such as dense rainforest. Jess Abrahams, the nature campaigner for the Australian Conservation Foundation, said climate change was hitting Australia’s world heritage areas “very hard”. “We have witnessed consecutive years of devastating coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, while global heating has been described as a catastrophic risk to the Wet Tropics and Shark Bay world heritage areas,” he said. “It’s really upsetting to see how much of the Blue Mountains world heritage area has been burnt. “This is a place many Australians know and love. It has significant Indigenous cultural values and is home to a number of rare and threatened species.”"
"Political appointees at the interior department have sought to play up climate pollution from California wildfires while downplaying emissions from fossil fuels as a way of promoting more logging in the nation’s forests, internal emails obtained by the Guardian reveal. The messaging plan was crafted in support of Donald Trump’s pro-industry arguments for harvesting more timber in California, which he says would thin forests and prevent fires – a point experts refute. The emails show officials seeking to estimate the carbon emissions from devastating 2018 fires in California so they could compare them to the carbon footprint of the state’s electricity sector and then publish statements encouraging cutting down trees. The records offer a look behind the scenes at how Trump and his appointees have tried to craft a narrative that forest protection efforts are responsible for wildfires, including in California, even as science shows fires are becoming more intense largely because of climate change. James Reilly, a former petroleum geologist and astronaut who is the director of the US Geological Survey, in a series of emails in 2018 asked scientists to “gin up” emissions figures for him. He also said the numbers would make a “decent sound bite”, and acknowledged that wildfire emissions estimates could vary based on what kind of trees were burning but picked the ones that he said would make “a good story”. Scientists who reviewed the exchanges said that at best Reilly used unfortunate language and the department cherry-picked data to help achieve their pro-industry policy goals; at worst he and others exploited a disaster and manipulated the data. The emails add to concerns that the Trump administration is doing industry’s bidding rather than pursuing the public interest. Across agencies, top positions are filled by former lobbyists, and dozens of investigative reports have revealed agencies working closely with major industries to ease pollution, public health and safety regulations. A USGS spokesperson said Reilly’s emails were “intended to instruct the subject matter expert to do the calculations as quickly as possible based on the best available data at the time and provide results in clear understandable language that the Secretary could use to effectively communicate to a variety of audiences.” The agency added that it “stands by the integrity of its science” When forests burn, they do emit greenhouse gases. But one expert said the numbers the interior department put forth are significant overestimates. They say logging wouldn’t necessarily help prevent or lessen wildfires. On the contrary, logging could negate the ability of forests to absorb carbon dioxide humans are emitting at record rates. Chad Hanson, a California-based forest ecologist who co-founded the John Muir Project and who has opposed logging after fires, called the strategizing revealed in the emails a “blatant political manipulation of science”. Mark Harmon, a professor emeritus at Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, said while it’s normal for the department to want to quantify emissions from fires, it’s unclear whether they began the process with a particular figure in mind. “Gin-up is an unfortunate phrase to be sure, but it might have been a very imprecise way to ask for an estimate. It certainly does not inspire confidence,” Harmon said. He said the resulting quotes from top officials and press releases from the department are “about what you would expect from agencies trying to justify actions they already decided to take with minimal analysis”. Harmon added that “the effect of logging on fires is highly variable,” depending on how it is done and the weather conditions. Not long after the interior department came up with its carbon emission estimates from the 2018 California wildfires, Trump issued an executive order instructing federal land managers to significantly increase the amount of timber they harvest. This fall, he also proposed allowing logging in Alaska’s Tongass national forest, the largest intact temperate rainforest in North America. Trump has also tweeted multiple times about wildfires, saying they are caused by bad land management or environmental laws that make water unavailable. Monica Turner, a fire ecology scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said “it is climate that is responsible for the size and severity of these fires”. An Interior department spokesperson said the department’s role is to follow the laws and use the best science and that it continues “to work to best understand and address the impacts of an ever-changing climate.” Agency officials started emphasizing wildfire emissions data as a talking point as early as August 2018. In an email chain that month, Reilly was asked by interior’s former deputy chief of staff Downey Magallanes to sign off on a statement that fires in 2018 had emitted 95.6m tons of CO2. “Interesting statistics,” Reilly responded, noting that emissions would vary based on the types of trees on the land. “…We assumed woodlands mix since we don’t currently have details on the overall land cover types involved. Any variance to the fuel type will still leave it in the range to make the comparison, however. I’ll use this one if you don’t object. Makes a good story.” Reilly, who was confirmed to his position in April 2018, later asked career scientists at the agency for updated numbers, according to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. “I need to get a number for total CO2 releases for the recent CA fires and a comparison against emissions for all energy in US … Tasker from the boss; back to me ASAP,” he said on 10 October 2018. His boss at the time was the former interior secretary Ryan Zinke. The job fell to Doug Beard, the director of the National Climate Adaptation Science Center, and Bradley Reed, an associate program coordinator in the Geographic Analysis and Monitoring Program, who responded with numbers from his team that afternoon. In November 2018, Reilly once again asked for the same estimates of carbon dioxide generated by two devastating fires that fall in California – the Camp and Woolsey fires. “The Secretary likes to have this kind of information when he speaks with the media,” Reilly said in a 16 November email to David Applegate, the associate director for natural hazards. Applegate directed Beard to get the numbers, and Reilly chimed in, asking Beard: “Can you have [the scientists] gin up an estimate on the total CO2 equivalent releases are so far for the current 2 fires in CA?” He said he wanted to compare the figures to the carbon pollution caused by transportation in California.  “That would make a decent sound bite the Sec could use to put some perspective on it,” said Reilly. Just a week earlier, the ferocious Camp fire had destroyed Paradise, California, killing dozens and becoming the deadliest wildfire in the state’s history. The scenes detailed were horrific. Conservatives have insisted that the wildfires are happening because environmentalists have overzealously encouraged the conservation of forests. Trump has battled with California – the face of the American progressive movement he opposes – over a multitude of other issues, including the state’s longstanding climate policy of requiring new cars to go farther on less fuel. The new emails show communications staffers and political appointees using government scientists as foot soldiers in those battles. Now, under the leadership of the former lobbyist David Bernhardt, the agency has sought to remove consideration of climate change from many of its decisions, while expanding oil and gas drilling on federal land. Multiple whistleblowers have accused the department of stifling climate science. Bernhardt in a May 2019 hearing told lawmakers there are no laws obligating him to combat climate change. After Reilly asked his staff to calculate the wildfire emissions numbers in November, an interior spokeswoman emailed him asking for the same information so she could put out a statement from Zinke. A few days later, the agency published a press release on Zinke’s behalf, with the title “New Analysis Shows 2018 California Wildfires Emitted as Much Carbon Dioxide as an Entire Year’s Worth of Electricity.” “There’s too much dead and dying timber in the forest, which fuels these catastrophic fires,” Zinke said. “Proper management of our forests, to include small prescribed burns, mechanical thinning, and other techniques, will improve forest health and reduce the risk of wildfires, while also helping curb the carbon emissions.” Hanson, the forest and fire ecologist, said that in addition to using the government data for political purposes, the department numbers overstated the carbon emissions from forest fires while downplaying emissions from fossil fuels. He said that the carbon emissions numbers generated by USGS and released to the public were an “overestimate” that “can’t be squared with empirical data” from field studies of post-wildfire burn sites in California. Other scientists the Guardian spoke with did not dispute the government’s data, but did find fault with the way it was presented to the public. “The comparison of fire to electrical emissions [in California] was not explained or justified”, said Harmon, the Oregon State University scientist. “Picking other sectors would have left an entirely different image in the reader’s mind…If the comparison had been made nationally it would have been found that fire related emissions of carbon dioxide were equivalent to 1.7% of fossil fuel related emissions. So it is hard to escape the conclusion that some cherry picking was going on.” Jayson O’Neill, the deputy director of the Western Values Project, said the emails are another example of the administration “trying to find ways to tell a story to achieve industry goals”. “As wildfire experts have repeatedly explained, you can’t log or even ‘rake’ our way out of this mess,” O’Neill said. “The Trump administration and the interior department are pushing mystical theories that are false in order to justify gutting public land protections to advance their pro-industry and lobbyist dominated agenda.”"
"Bramblings are probably among the commonest birds that most Britons have never knowingly seen. Fringilla montifringilla is the chaffinch equivalent that’s found across the boreal forests of northern Eurasia, but here they appear only in winter, visiting almost anywhere with trees, frequently in towns and even big cities, and routinely at birdfeeders. Beechmast is a key part of their diet and at Lightwood there are currently about 500 bramblings scattered across the high canopy. The flock is hypervigilant and edgy, so that no single bird is in view for any length of time. Small groups repeatedly take short downward flights on a trajectory that makes them seem as if they’re skiing between the branches. Then up they surge back to the tops. Occasionally one tree inexplicably gathers them in and they’ll sit there en masse, glowing but restlessly rearranging position, like strangely animate tree decorations. The male’s front and shoulders are sunset orange, and his head is blackish. All bramblings have undersides of linen white that can gleam silver in sharp light. Their backs are brindled pinky brown, with two black-and-white slashes over the wings. The other compelling detail is a pure-white rump, and as a flock departs it will present as a galaxy of snowy spheres that all flash as they vanish into the dark chaos of the treescape. A final key element in the pleasure of brambling flocks are their calls, especially a minute, repeated djup in flight, then a longer zweejj that sounds like wet sponge on rubber. The brambling’s beak is yellowish pink and pointed like tweezer tips, which it uses to extract beech seeds from their spiny cases. Here the birds are feeding in a way I’ve never observed before, peeling off strips of moss and lichen from the branches of the sycamores. Presumably they are in search of arthropods, but in aggregate the technique sends down a drizzle of plant fragments. But moss stripping is a business that holds them barely a minute, and off they swirl as one, amid fresh squalls of buzzy notes, the sudden sleet of their white rumps and a faint susurration composed by a thousand small wings."
"Thousands of sheep waiting to be exported ended up dying of hunger and thirst, after an outbreak of Rift Valley fever led to a temporary Saudi block on trade. The appearance of the disease in any country that depends on the export trade is potentially catastrophic. Countries are supposed to notify the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), which will then place restrictions on their trade. Sudanese government ministers admit it was a difficult decision to send the notification, knowing that it would have profound economic effects. The outbreak has now been declared over. Live animals are one of Sudan’s most important exports, bringing in approximately $500 million (£384,620) in 2018, according to the International Trade Centre. But in September last year, Sudan informed the OIE that Rift Valley fever had found its way into the country. In October Saudi Arabia, which buys more than 70% of its livestock from Sudan, announced a ban on imports. The ban had a devastating effect on farmers and exporters, who were forced in some cases to sell their animals at half the usual price. Siddiq Hedob, a member of an independent livestock exporters’ body in Khartoum, estimated that about 30% of the exporters in Sudan “have lost money”. “When the minister of health announced the decision, there were about 80,000 sheep at Port Sudan waiting to be transferred to Saudi but it didn’t happen, even though they were all healthy,” Hedob said. “So they spent about four days without food or drinking water and many of them had died and were thrown in the sea.” However, other sources denied that animals had been disposed of in the water. Exporter Abdelrahman El-Shaeekh said thousands of his cattle were being kept in Omdurman city, which was costing him a lot of money. He did not know when exactly they could be sent off to Saudi Arabia. “I have 6,000 sheep and I had to keep them in Omdurman. Each cost me 40 Sudanese pound (£0.70) a day for food and drink, apart from what I pay for the vet,” he said. Rift Valley fever is a disease that affects both humans and animals: it is transmitted by mosquito and leads to miscarriage and sometimes death in animals. A vaccine for both humans and animals exists. The disease has been moving across east Africa for the last couple of years and the World Health Organization has been among the agencies monitoring its progress and warning of possible economic impacts. A Sudanese government official said notifying the OIE had been the correct decision. Minister of Health Dr Akram Altoum told the Guardian: “When I first consulted the minister of finance, foreign minister, animal resources minister, trade and the industry, and the local governments, we agree[d] that yes this is painful, but please go ahead and declare. We felt it had to happen, it’s a principle.” “It would cost our economy thousands of dollars and a whole market of exports, but we had to do it. We didn’t do it with any expectations of reward, but it came with its own reward. We collaborated with countries like Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council and they helped to control the disease. Thanks to the vaccine and the technical support they gave us … it will be behind us.” It is believed that other countries have been less rigorous about notifying the authorities about suspected outbreaks. Questions have long been asked about the mysterious absence of African swine fever from Belarus, for example, which is entirely surrounded by countries that have suffered severe epidemics."
"The growth of the live animal export trade will make the spread of diseases more likely, experts have warned. Almost 30% more pigs, goats, cows and sheep were shipped, flown and driven across the world in 2017 than a decade earlier, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. The figure is set to rise further, partly because it is still often cheaper to move live animals than use refrigerated transport, despite advances in technology. Consumer demand for fresh meat is also rising as the global population approaches 8 billion, including many who are increasingly adopting diets rich in meat. But transporting live animals around the world increases the risk of disease transmission, according to veterinarians and epidemiologists who fear the growing industry may have already caused viruses to spread. Jeroen Dewulf, a veterinarian at Ghent University in Belgium, said the introduction of the African swine fever virus (ASF) into Belgium had almost certainly been caused by human interference: either through imported contaminated animal products or by illegal movements of wild boar. “There are several drivers of spreading diseases, but live animals are the largest source of infection,” Dewulf said. “The more you are going to move animals, the more you run the risk that diseases will be spread through these animals. There are other routes, the virus can be transmitted in meat products for example, but it’s much more efficient to transmit via live animals.”  David McIver, a senior scientist and epidemiologist at biotech company Metabiota, said the rise in live animal exports was a growing issue for many other diseases, such as avian influenza virus, mad cow disease and Nipah virus, while he warned that ASF could one day feasibly threaten humans in some form. “The first case of Nipah virus in 1998 came after an outbreak in Malaysia following the expansion of pig farming in pristine rainforest areas,” he said. “Bats were eating fruit, they dropped it with their saliva on it, it was eaten by pigs, then it gets into humans and there were 105 deaths. Tons of swine had to be culled to get the outbreak under control. If we’re exporting those animals around the world we’re potentially moving unknown pathogens to new places.” In another well-known case, British live cattle exports, as well as those of beef products, were banned in the 1990s due to the fear of spreading bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease. It is believed that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare, fatal brain disorder, is likely to be caused by people ingesting meat contaminated with mad cow disease. The authors of a study in journal BioMed warned in 2015: “Animal trade is an effective way of introducing, maintaining and spreading animal diseases, as observed with the spread of different strains of foot and mouth disease in Africa, the Middle East and Asia and the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), for example, into Oman and Canada through the importation of infected cattle.” McIver added: “Even though ASF doesn’t affect humans now, pigs and people are not so different biologically and immunologically, so it is conceivable that a few small changes in the genetics of the virus can allow that to hop into people and then we’ve got ourselves a serious problem.” Prof Dirk Pfeiffer, from City University in Hong Kong and the Royal Veterinary College in London, said the risk depends on where you are in the world. “It’s very regulated in high-income countries with fairly effective measures in place protecting their livestock populations from spread of infectious diseases,” he said. “The real issue is in many of the low- to medium-income countries where there are new opportunities for money to be made, and that includes increased meat demand. Movements of live animals in these parts of the world play a role in spreading animal disease.” In China, for example, live animals are regularly moved around the country in order to supply the ‘wet markets’ where butchers serve up freshly slaughtered meat. These places have long been connected with disease risk – and, indeed, the recent outbreak of coronavirus has been traced back to a wet market in Wuhan. A system managed by the World Organisation for Animal Health monitors disease outbreaks and provides information based on the reporting of affected countries. While it is praised for its role, it has to rely on prompt and honest reporting from states to be fully effective. “One of the perverse incentives about the surveillance system is that the harder you research the more likely you’ll find something, and then the country will be a victim of finding something,” Dewulf said. “In Belgium, for example, with the recent ASF outbreak, we were carefully monitoring, we notified all the responsible agencies, and then we faced all the consequences, such as trade restrictions, etc. In consequence, our animal industry has been hit very hard.” But despite the growing realisation of the need to control exports more robustly, experts warn that it would be impossible to screen all animals. “In most cases where we look at the transmission of disease, whether in humans or livestock, we tend to see them move quicker and in more diverse ways than our surveillance systems are able to keep up with,” McIver said. Nor are these systems designed to screen live animals or meat products entering or leaving countries, he said, before warning of diseases which have not yet been identified. “Due to the sheer volume of animals that move around, the budgets that are allocated towards it are not always sufficient and in many cases we’re only able to look for things we know about. Animals may be coming or going with pathogens that are potentially really dangerous but we just haven’t dealt with them yet.”"
"Each year, unfathomable amounts of energy are added to the oceans. Scientists measure heat in joules; the amount of heat in the oceans is so large that we report it in zettajoules. What is a zettajoule? It is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules. The amount of heat we are putting into the oceans is equivalent to about five Hiroshima atom bombs of energy every second. I am part of the team of researchers that published a paper on ocean warming that shows the total heat of Earth is increasing with global heating, as scientists have predicted for decades. Each year, we take Earth’s temperature to try to determine what is happening to our climate. Each year the news is worse than the year before. There is hope, which I will discuss later. But first, let’s talk about the new study. As humans emit heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, it creates an energy imbalance. There is more heat coming in than going out. That means the Earth is out of balance, and temperatures are rising. The vast majority of the excess energy – more than 90% – ends up in the oceans. Consequently, ocean temperatures are rising, and we can measure it. Global warming is really ocean warming, and it has severe consequences. First, it makes ocean levels rise, because warming water expands. Scientists estimate that by the year 2100, oceans will be about 3ft higher than they were in the year 2000, displacing 150 million people around the world. Warmer oceans also make our weather more extreme. They supercharge typhoons and hurricanes. They make rains more deadly and flooding more severe. The rising temperatures are also threatening sea life. We are experiencing major die-offs of coral reefs, which are incredibly important to ocean biodiversity. Rising ocean water is not just a problem for fish and sea life, it is a problem for everyone. The leader of our team, Dr Lijing Cheng, developed an innovative way to measure ocean temperatures. We only get data where we place temperature sensors, and sophisticated mathematics are used to fill in the gaps and create a continuous picture of what is happening. His method of filling in the data gaps has been shown to be very accurate and scientists around the world have adopted the techniques.  Often when scientists report climate data, they try to show trends. It isn’t so important what the ocean temperatures were last year or what they will be this year. What really matters is the trend: are the oceans getting hotter or colder? Using the late 1990s as a reference, we see that years prior are colder and years after are warmer. In fact, we see that the oceans have warmed continuously since about 1990. This long-term trend is what climate breakdown looks like, and it is terrible news for the future of the planet. All reasonable people know that the climate is warming and humans are the cause. Sometimes, I am asked for proof of warming, and there are many things I can point to: ice is melting, air temperatures are increasing, sea levels are rising, etc. But the best proof of warming is in the oceans. No one can dispute the data. The oceans are unequivocally warming. So, what do we do about it? Well, we can begin to use energy more wisely. This will not only help with the climate crisis but save money as well. Secondly, we can maximise our energy from renewable sources such as wind, water, and solar. One of the things that gives me hope is that energy from solar and wind power is now cheaper than dirty coal. The benefits of solar and wind depend, of course, on how sunny or windy the conditions are, but with the drop in green energy prices, it no longer makes economic sense to build coal plants. Another bit of hope is represented by the growing actions of our youth. Make no mistake, the Greta Thunbergs of the world will change things in ways that privileged middle-aged white men like me cannot. Their generation will inherit a dire situation, but they have the passion to act, and decades of unarguable evidence that they must. So yes, 2019 set yet another dire record for Earth’s climate. But the fight continues to make the future more habitable for our children and their children."
"The Galápagos National Park has announced it is ending a captive breeding program for giant Española tortoises, after one tortoise produced more than 800 offspring, helping save the species. When the breeding program began, just 15 representatives of the species Chelonoidis hoodensis remained in the wild on the island of Española. Twelve were female and three were male. Extinction seemed imminent. But included in the captive breeding program was Diego, an enterprising male on loan from the San Diego Zoo. His inclusion turned out to be pivotal. The breeding program produced 2,000 tortoises, 40% of which were thanks to Diego, who is now more than 100 years old. “We developed mathematical models with different possible scenarios for the next 100 years and in all the conclusion was that the island has sufficient conditions to keep the tortoise population that will continue to grow normally, even without any new repatriation of juveniles,” said Washington Tapia, director of the Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative (GTRI). Officials said the success of the program was also thanks to the eradication of non-native species and the cultivation of cactus on which the tortoises rely. Once, 15 species of giant tortoise called the Galápagos Islands home. Two of those species are now considered extinct. According to the GTRI, in the mid-1800s the tortoises served as food for buccaneers and whalers and were also hunted for oil. "
"Clothes washed at 25C on a 30-minute cycle shed fewer microfibres into waste water and keep their colour for longer, researchers at the University of Leeds have found. This makes sense. After all, consumers have long been advised by detergent manufacturers and environmental organisations to turn down the dial on the washing machine to 30C. Dropping to 25C is a small adjustment, but possibly a greater psychological one: will clothes really be clean at that temperature, and on such a short cycle? Lucy Cotton, the report’s lead author, said that the temperature of the water used in the test machines, which were set on a “cold” cycle, was 25C. Her research tested the release of dye and of microfibres from a range of consumer clothing, such as Fruit of the Loom T-shirts. However, the clothes were not dirty when they went into the wash, and only the release of microfibres and desorption of dye were measured. “We weren’t testing for cleanliness,” she says. “One of the things that is useful about this study is that it puts the onus on detergent manufacturers to explore this area. Can they make the cleanliness happen in a cold, quick wash?” Wrap, the waste reduction charity that has a campaign called Love Your Clothes, considers 30C to be a cold wash – even though, in 2013, the EU’s Ecodesign initiative made an even lower 20C setting compulsory on new washing machine models, and 30C is not cold (my local outdoor lido is heated to 25C). But according to the Energy Savings Trust, washing clothing at 20C instead of 40C saves about 66% of the energy used for a load (compared to a 40% saving for dropping to 30C). Proctor & Gamble tested its Ariel Gel for effectiveness and stain removal at 20C, while Which? magazine found in a test that an olive oil stain was the only one a 20C wash couldn’t shift compared with a 40C wash. It’s got to be worth a try. But just remember to keep the cycle length short, and avoid a delicates wash because these use more water than average cycles and cause more microfibres to shed."
"Appearances aside, true peace is elusive here. The A1, just over a rise, keeps the background away from silence most days. It’s subtle, like an endless exhale, and you don’t notice it’s there – but you notice when it’s not. Sunday mornings come close. Then, you register other sounds. Different sounds. More deliberate. Designed to scare. I walk the lane that leads to a low amphitheatre of farmland four miles wide, and I hear one: a distant crack, softly reverberating. Sometimes they are dull and boxy, echoless, like a finger flicked against cardboard. Sometimes they sound like cannon, and bounce around the landscape’s shallow folds. Bird scarers are interesting. They’re battle tactics, as old as agriculture, that examine reflexive responses and enemy psychology across species borders. Consider the thinking behind anti-crop-picker methods: from scarecrows to plastic owls and herons (static, or with moving heads for sharper foes). From plastic bottles on windmills to “terror eyes” balloons to lasers to propane-powered bangers that pierce the Sunday silence. There are laws on these last, but not many: four bangs an hour are allowed, only during daylight and as loud as you want. The bang isn’t just to make the birds jump, I’ve read. They are meant to sound like guns, because birds know what guns do. That intelligence is critical. Here by the dry-stone wall of the lane I’m surrounded by wispy-winged bugs of some sort – odd, on such a cold day – too instinctive to be bothered by anything. Yet in the field there is a kite. Not a child’s kite: a decoy kite. The silhouette is unambiguous. The splay tail and hard angle of the wings make it a ringer for the red variant, reintroduced and thriving around here. It’s a strange feedback loop. Plastic, masquerading as a species driven out by farmers in the first place – now re-abundant for real. I wonder if the fake kite is putting the real ones off; two wood pigeons nibbling this field seem to be banking on it. Not long after, I hear the bang again. The pigeons don’t move. I take a step toward them and they take flight. Maybe they’re smarter than we give them credit for.  "
"The live export trade carrying millions of sheep and cattle across the seas each year is plagued by “old” and “inferior” ships that are a threat to animal welfare, claims a leading shipping company.Livestock carriers are a key part of the multibillion dollar live export industry, dominated by Australia, South America and Europe. In 2017, almost 2 billion animals were exported in a trade worth $21bn (£15bn), with a significant proportion travelling by sea. But most of the ships are old car carriers or other former cargo ships, rather than purpose-built vessels that can meet higher standards of animal welfare, said Wellard, one of the world’s largest livestock exporters, based in Australia. A spokesperson for the company, which shipped nearly 400,000 cattle in 2019, said: “The old converted vessels bring the standard of the whole industry down. If you’re using a ship that was originally built for another purpose, you’re compromising on your animal services when you convert it to a livestock vessel. “The biggest threat to the global live export industry is old ships. They have inferior standards and livestock services and they are more prone to accidents and breakdowns. Those ships give a bad name to a legitimate industry.” More than half of the 129 livestock carriers listed as active with a working automated tracking system on at least one marine website were built before the 1980s. “The livestock carrier fleet is one of the oldest sectors in the globally trading fleet with an average vessel age of 38 years old,” said Adam Kent, managing director of market analysts Maritime Strategies International (MSI). In comparison, the average age of a container ship is 13. “Only the Laker fleet, trading on the freshwater Great Lakes, has an older average age,” he said. “Given that around 80% of all livestock carriers are converted vessels, which were originally designed for another cargo, the relative investment in the sector is significantly below other ship types,” he added. Most ships were converted from general cargo or “roll on roll off” (RoRo) vessels, meaning ships that have been designed to carry wheeled cargo.The Dutch company Vroon, which owns the subsidiary Livestock Express, is known as the “world’s biggest independent seaborne livestock carrier”, with a fleet of 13 purpose-built vessels. Around half its ships have a gross tonnage of 10,241 and can carry more than 4,600 heads of cattle. Livestock Express managing director Paul Pistorius warned that converting old vessels into livestock carriers means making “compromises”. “When converting a vessel, you must live with the original hull and machinery and furthermore you always need to make compromises during the conversion phase. History has shown that these compromises may lead to poor animal welfare outcomes. “There are indeed a lot of old conversions and also recent conversions of old hulls. Unfortunately, many of these vessels don’t always meet the standards to which we believe livestock carriers should adhere,” he said. The practice of transporting thousands of live animals (some ships carry more than 10,000 animals) across the sea for weeks at a time means attention must be paid to the welfare of animals. Older ships were not built for this purpose, which raises concerns. The most common health risks for animals on ships are fatigue, heat stress, overcrowding and related injuries, and the spread of disease. Lynn Simpson, a former veterinarian on livestock export ships, has been a vocal critic of the long-distance ship trade. She’s witnessed cattle forced to stand on hard floors for weeks on end, sick, injured animals left to die, and sheep literally cooking from the inside with their “fat melted and like a translucent jelly”.“Some animals are held on decks for as long as 40 days, living on hard decking of concrete and metal. They [the animals] are not built to cope with these environments,” said Simpson. She points out that the long time spent at sea makes it even more critical for ships to be well-adapted for animals to protect their health and welfare. “A truck is transporting from A to B, but a ship is really a floating feedlot. They are at sea for up to six weeks so it’s not just a small period of time. They [the animals] have to eat, sleep, drink and recover.”“The live animal trade is not one where great fortunes are made. The unsuitability of the ships has created a lot of issues for the welfare of the animals. There has been a lot of concern about converted ships, which have a checkered history of inspection failings,” said Andrew Linington, former editor for the maritime trade union, Nautilus International. In November the Queen Hind, a 40-year-old vessel owned by Romanian company MGM Marine, was carrying more than 14,000 sheep when it capsized en route from Romania. The 22 crew members were rescued but just 180 sheep survived. Campaign groups said at the time that a major problem was that often vessels were not built for the journey. “They are old vessels that are converted to transport animals,” Francesca Porta from Eurogroup for Animals in Brussels told the New York Times. That incident prompted Nautilus International to call for an investigation into converted livestock carriers, saying the industry must “learn safety lessons for keeping seafarers safe and improving animal welfare”. “There’s a risk that in these long-distance transport there are major problems with animals overheating in highly humid, dirty conditions … where a vessel has been converted it will be less able to control bad conditions,” said a spokesperson from Compassion in World Farming. Mortality figures in the export of livestock are largely unavailable as the majority of countries, aside from Australia and New Zealand, do not require them to be publicly reported. The International Maritime Organization only requires an investigation of casualties at sea if they led to the death or serious injury of a person, or serious damage to the ship or the marine environment. In Australia the government reports on any shipments where the mortality rate exceeds 1%. In August 2017, around 2,400 sheep died from heat stress on a ship sent from Australia to the Middle East. For Europe, the only available mortality figures are from media reports on major incidents. In 2015, Jordan rejected a shipment of 13,000 sheep from Romania because 40% of the animals were dead. A veterinary inspection at port found that it was not disease that caused the high mortality rate, but a failure to provide adequate food or water on the eight-day trip. Simpson said the mortality rates were likely to be higher in other regions not reporting figures. “The ships I was on 10 years ago carried 10,000 cattle for 20-day voyages and if you lost 15 animals I would say that was average. When they were travelling out of South America, the crew told me the same ships would have 14,000 cattle and would lose 300–500 animals in a voyage.“They don’t care about animal welfare. It is just about numbers, which would be fine if we were talking about cans of soup.”A large number of livestock-carrying ships are also sailing under flags of convenience with poor reputations for ship safety. Out of the 129 ships listed as active, 52 are flying flags from countries currently blacklisted by the port inspection body the Paris MOU, which conducts more than 17,000 inspections on ships every year in ports around the world.In addition, 10 of the companies that own or manage converted vessels built before 1975 are listed as “low or very low-performing” by the European Maritime Shipping Agency.

"The Danish government has been labelled “unsatisfactory” and “ineffective” in an audit of its ballooning piglet trade published today.  In 2008 3.2 million live pigs were exported from Denmark; by 2018 that number had risen to 9.6 million. But the government continued to carry out just 100 checks a year up until 2018, according to the audit, with just 0.4% of transports being checked. The report also found that even when transporters repeatedly violated the rules, there was no kind of fine or sanction. The report concludes that as a result, there was “an unnecessarily high risk that the pigs may be injured or have suffered injuries during transport”.  In recent years Denmark has built up an industry in exporting piglets, and a particularly productive partnership with Poland. Danish pigs have been bred to produce large litters, so Danish piglets are cheaper than elsewhere in Europe. But regulations and labour costs are less onerous in Poland, so it is cheaper to rear and slaughter pigs there. As a result trade has increased, with Denmark exporting more than six million piglets to Poland in 2017.  The vast majority of those are weaners – piglets of between 10 and 12 weeks that have just been weaned from their mothers. They are shipped in multi-storied trucks of up to five floors, and by law each piglet is allotted 0.2 sq metres of space. At the maximum speeds allowed, according to Google maps, the driver could make it border to border in just under six hours. In reality, the trip would take eight hours or more. The piglets, who will still have been feeding from their mother not long before setting off, are not fed during the journey: they do have access to water though, as long as the driver remembers to keep the tank full. The average Danish sow can produce a world beating 33.3 piglets a year. In the US the average is 26.4, and in the UK indoor herds are averaging nearly 26. But the Poles can rear them more cheaply. Over the last few years the Danes have raised welfare and environmental standards for their pigs. But that has come, as the industry acknowledges, at a cost. As the former UK head of the Danish Agriculture and Food Council (DAFC), John Howard, explained in Global Meat News in 2014: “We would prefer to see more pigs finished in Denmark, but there are high environmental costs experienced by Danish farmers which are not shared by their colleagues south of the border [in Germany].” Labour costs are cheaper in Poland, and in recent years processing infrastructure has been built. The piglets arrive at Polish farms, are raised, fattened, slaughtered and turned into Polish sausages. And Poland has made the most of the opportunity. Since 2000, the country has built an entire pork industry, one of the largest in the EU; it has its own national herd of about 10 million pigs, and imports more. It has invested in the processing equipment needed in order to turn those pigs into sausages. A lack of slaughter facilities has slowed many of its east European neighbours in developing a meat export industry, but Poland has spent more than $800m on processing equipment since 2000 and built modern abattoirs, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity. There are some who worry that this situation is not ideal for Polish farmers. “There are too few farms in Poland offering good stock for fattening. Farmers that want to specialise in pork but don’t want to breed pigs face the dilemma of where to source their piglets, often in batches of 1,000 or more. Foreign breeders can meet that demand,” said Martyna Batorska from the Warsaw Life Sciences University. “Polish pig farms are small and breed pigs in closed cycle, which is difficult, is too expensive and requires experience and time. In order to keep, say, 300 piglets for fattening, you need to have and take care of sows. Then you need to be able to maintain the right conditions for piglets after they’re born,” Batorska said. “It’s all very difficult. Much simpler just to buy piglets,” she added. “In Poland, farmers breed piglets only when they specialise in Polish breeds or if they’ve specialised in closed cycle pig farming, but those are few and far between,” said Maksymilian Zaręba, a farmer living near Pułtusk in the Warsaw province. And the piglets? The trade from Denmark is now attracting closer attention after Animal Welfare Denmark (AWD) obtained official veterinary records and published the fact that the monitoring bodies were carrying out just 100 checks a year on export vehicles. “That has now increased to about 250 a month,” said Ditte Erichsen, a vet specialising in transport who works with AWD. The journey logs for long transports showed that the monitoring bodies had found hundreds of violations, “but despite finding many violations, the inspectors had never reported anyone to the police”. But still, she said, it is nearly impossible to get data on the journey. “No one keeps records, that we’ve been able to find, about mortality rates, for example. You have young animals, travelling without food, and in some cases without water. But we really know nothing about them.” “Polish companies importing piglets must meet all standards for transport of live animals. If those standards are higher in the source markets, such as in Denmark or the Netherlands, then they must meet those standards. It is better conditions than [animal rights] activists want people to see,” said a manager at one of the piglet-importing companies, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) told the Guardian it has cooperated closely with the Danish auditor general (Rigsrevisionen) in investigating the long haul transport of pigs.  “The issues raised and the points of critique in the general auditor’s report are lessons to learn from. Since the summer of 2018, when the DVFA became aware that we did not systematically follow up on the logs, administrative procedures and control routines were amended to safeguard the conditions for transported pigs. Furthermore the number of physical controls of the pigs wellbeing as well as the standards of vehicles has been increased significantly.” Christian Fink Hansen, director at SEGES Danish Pig Research Centre, part of the DAFC, told the Guardian: “Meat production and export is of great importance to the Danish economy and creates a large number of jobs, so it is the aim of the Danish pig sector that as many pigs as possible are raised and slaughtered in Denmark. Because of the superior health status and genetics there is however a great demand for Danish pigs from other countries. It is a shared goal for farmers and transport companies that the pigs are transported in a safe manner, so they arrive in best possible condition and good health. All transport of animals from Denmark must comply with EU regulations for transport of live animals.” He added: “Denmark is a small country with a large production of livestock, so it is only natural that part of the production is sold outside the country. If you look at larger European countries, then a transport of piglets from Denmark to Poland easily compares to a transport within the country in, for instance, Sweden or Italy. So just looking at cross-border transport gives a somewhat biased picture.”"
"Colgate has launched a new toothpaste which is being billed as the first of a kind because it comes in a recyclable tube. Toothpaste tubes have traditionally been impossible to recycle because they are made from a mixture of plastic and aluminium. Consumers get through 20bn packs of toothpaste every year with discarded tubes contributing to the plastic pollution crisis. But Colgate’s new Smile for Good brand, which has also been certified by the Vegan Society, comes in a tube made from high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is the same plastic as milk containers. Colgate said its engineers had figured out a way to turn the hard plastic, which is widely recyclable, into a “comfortably squeezable” tube. The technology will be shared with rivals, Colgate-Palmolive said, as part of its commitment to reduce usage of what is one of the most widely used forms of plastic packaging that cannot be recycled. However, the green toothpaste, which is on sale in Waitrose and Boots, comes at a high price. At £5 for 75ml, Smile for Goods costs more than six times as much as a regular tube of Colgate. Colgate-Palmolive’s chief executive, Noel Wallace, said: “Colgate wants to make tubes a part of the circular economy by keeping this plastic productive and eliminating waste. If we can standardise recyclable tubes among all companies, we all win. We can align on these common standards for tubes and still compete with what’s inside them.” Colgate has also taken the unusual step of listing the toothpaste’s ingredients on the tube alongside a simple explanation of their function. Consumers trying to buy greener products were confused by the role of the various ingredients, the company said. While the role of fluoride is probably well understood, the tube explains that silica cleans and polishes while glycerin prevents the paste from drying out. As concern grows about the impact of single-use plastic on the environment, manufacturers and retailers have begun to tackle their substantial footprints. Colgate-Palmolive, which also owns the Palmolive and Sanex brands, has said the packaging on all its products will be 100% recyclable by 2025. Last year Unilever said it would halve its use of virgin plastic by creating greener versions of its household products, a shift that could make shampoo refill stations, cardboard deodorant sticks and toothpaste tablets the norm in supermarkets."
"Around the world, capital cities celebrated the new year and new decade with fireworks. Many people were disappointed with London’s show, as smoke obscured the views amid still air. Lack of wind also slowed the dispersion of firework smoke throughout London, creating the year’s first air pollution incident in the capital. It was also the first such incident to be recorded on any New Year’s Day in London since the start of modern measurements of particle pollution in 1993. For four hours, the air was filled with tiny particles of the metals that are used to make firework colours. These included barium, copper and strontium that produce white, green, blue and red colours, along with potassium and chloride that are used as firework propellants. Air pollution from northern France also reached the city later in the day. In 2019 over 300,000 people signed a UK petition to ban the sale of fireworks to the public. New Year’s Day fireworks in Sydney divided public opinion at a time when firefighters were tackling still-burning deadly bushfires and people were losing their homes. Although pre-recorded a few days before, Shanghai’s new year display, with lit drones creating shapes in the sky, may be a more environmentally-friendly, but still spectacular, way to start future new years."
"Customers of some of the UK’s biggest fast-food chains including Pizza Hut and Burger King may be eating meat that comes from chickens reared in poor conditions, claims a new report from a leading animal charity. Amid growing concerns about the intensive and large-scale production of meat – with some birds growing so fast that they routinely suffer from lameness and skin lesions – World Animal Protection (WAP) has ranked eight of the leading brands according to their commitment, ambition and transparency to improve chicken welfare globally. In the UK it has been calling on Nando’s to urgently improve its chicken welfare policies, but the results of its analysis, published on Wednesday, reveal the chain has for the second consecutive year received a “poor” rating. The most improved is KFC, which has leaped from “poor” last year to “making progress”. In July it became the first UK fast food chain to sign up to the European Chicken Commitment – new welfare standards for farmed chickens that will improve the welfare of millions of birds in the UK, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden. For its report the charity analysed the policies of leading chains with retail operations in the UK; Burger King, Domino’s Pizza Group plc (covering Europe), KFC, McDonald’s, Nando’s, Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Subway. It also included Domino’s Pizza Inc which operates in the US and Canada. Burger King, Pizza Hut and Domino’s were all classed as having a “very poor” approach to managing chicken welfare. Only three of the chains assessed were classed as “getting started” or “making progress” on improving chicken welfare standards – KFC, Starbucks and Subway. Most companies are still failing to take chicken welfare seriously, the report said. Ian Woodhurst, WAP UK farming campaigns manager, said: “While it’s encouraging to see companies like KFC starting to take chicken welfare seriously, many people in the UK are expecting to see other companies, such as Nando’s, also do the right thing for chickens. These companies face a real reputational risk if they don’t take action now to move away from the use of fast-growing chickens that suffer from catastrophic health issues and live their short lives in unnecessary pain. “Consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about animal welfare and these iconic companies have the power to put an end to this suffering that they are causing for the sake of their own profits. We will continue to speak up for chickens and consumers to put pressure on companies to make real change.” In the UK sales of red meat have fallen in recent years, but chicken – seen as a “healthy” meat – has seen sales rise. Fast-food chains are also increasingly launching “vegan-friendly”, plant-based versions of traditional meat patties. The charity is calling on the chains to take a lead on animal welfare and ensure that any chickens being served at their restaurants are reared in humane conditions. Nina Arnott, a spokesperson for Domino’s plc, said: “Domino’s Pizza Group is committed to ensuring high standards of animal welfare throughout our supply chain. We have strict welfare policies and regular checks to ensure our supply partners are 100% compliant. All our chickens are reared with natural daylight and enrichment, including perches and bales of straw. We do not have any battery cages in our supply chain. Domino’s has published a number of targets for 2020 to ensure we continue improving our welfare standards.” A spokesperson for Subway said: “Subway takes animal welfare seriously by working closely with our suppliers to ensure that animals are treated well in accordance with Subway’s global animal welfare policy. All UK and Ireland chicken suppliers and their producers must, as a minimum, comply with EU animal welfare legislation and globally we support the principles of the Farm Animal Welfare Council Five Freedoms, which is a framework to safeguard and continually improve animal welfare. A spokesperson for Burger King said: “Responsible animal welfare is a top priority for Burger King UK and we work very closely with our suppliers to ensure that all animals reared for meat are well cared for and treated. We require our meat suppliers and their producers to support the principles of the globally recognised Farm Animal Welfare Council Five Freedoms.” A spokesperson for McDonald’s said: “We are deeply committed to the health and welfare of all animals in our supply chain and know that our customers expect us to uphold high standards. Together with our suppliers, we work hard to focus on continuous improvement and have led the industry with positive moves on chicken welfare. For example, three years ago we made a progressive change to increase the daylight provision and enrichment for all birds in our supply chain for all chicken served in our UK and Irish restaurants, providing pecking objects and perches to encourage the birds to express their natural behaviours. These steps meet higher welfare scheme requirements and are ahead of many of our competitors. A spokesperson for Pizza Hut said: “We take animal welfare extremely seriously and have stringent policies in place to ensure all our suppliers adhere to the highest standards. We are also taking steps to ensure we continue to progress in this area – we support the European Chicken Commitment and as such we will expect our suppliers to meet a series of set requirements for all of the chicken in our supply chain by 2026. In addition to this, all our eggs are now free range, which is something we worked to achieve a year ahead of our target.” KFC said: “We know our customers care deeply about chicken welfare standards and our business depends on it. We were proud to be one of the first restaurant brands to sign up to the Better Chicken Commitment but we won’t stop there. This is just the beginning and we hope others take confidence from our commitment and join the growing movement to create real change to improve the lives of chickens.” Nando’s said: “We take animal welfare very seriously, knowing it’s as important to our customers as it is to us. We know that as a recognisable chicken restaurant group we have a responsibility to ensure that every aspect of how we source our chicken is done in the best possible way. We welcome initiatives like the Better Chicken Commitment and share the aspiration and recognition of the need to change, which we believe needs to be a combined effort across the industry. We look forward to keeping everyone updated on our plans as we move forward on this important issue.” Domino’s Inc and Starbucks have been approached for comment."
"Close to the Western River on Kangaroo Island, Pat Hodgens had set up cameras to snap the island’s rare dunnart – a tiny mouse-like marsupial that exists nowhere else on the planet. Now, after two fires ripped through the site a few days ago, those cameras – and likely many of the Kangaroo Island dunnarts – are just charred hulks. “It’s gone right through the under storey and that’s where these species live,” said Hodgens, an ecologist at Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife, a not-for-profit conservation group. “The habitat is decimated.” On Friday afternoon word came through that three other Land for Wildlife sites protecting dunnarts and other endangered species, including the southern brown bandicoot, had also been consumed by fire on the island off the South Australian coast. Prof Sarah Legge, of the Australian National University, said the prognosis for the Kangaroo Island dunnart was “not good” and its plight was symbolic of what was happening all across the east coast of Australia. “Many dozens” of threatened species had been hit hard by the fires, she said. In some cases “almost their entire distribution has been burnt”. So far, the Australian bushfire season has burned through about 5.8m hectares of bush, known across the world for its unique flora and fauna.  Ecologists say the months of intense and unprecedented fires will almost certainly push several species to extinction. The fires have pushed back conservation efforts by decades, they say, and, as climate heating grips, some species may never recover. Climate scientists have long warned that rising greenhouse gases will spark a wave of extinctions. Now ecologists fear the bushfires represent the catastrophic beginning of a bleak future for the country’s native flora and fauna. “It feels like we have hit a turning point that we predicted was coming as a consequence of climate change,” Legge said. “We are now in uncharted territory.” Bushfires don’t just burn animals to death but create starvation events. Birds lose their breeding trees and the fruits and invertebrates they feed on. Ground-dwelling mammals that do survive emerge to find an open landscape with nowhere to hide, which one ecologist said became a “hunting arena” for feral cats and foxes. “It’s reasonable to infer that there will be dramatic consequences to very many species,” said Prof John Woinarski, of Charles Darwin University. “The fires are of such scale and extent that high proportions of many species, including threatened species, will have been killed off immediately.” He said footage of kangaroos and flocks of birds fleeing fires was no evidence of their survival. With fires extending so widely, they run out of places to escape. “We know that the species that can’t fly away – like koalas and greater gliders – are gone in burnt areas. Wombats may survive as they’re underground but, even if they do escape the immediate fire front, there’s essentially no food for them in a burnt landscape.” Woinarski said the critically endangered long-footed potoroo was restricted almost entirely to East Gippsland, which has been devastated by this year’s fires. In southern Queensland, much of the known range of the silver-headed antechinus “has been obliterated by fires”, he said. He said fires had always been a feature of the Australian landscape but in normal circumstances extensive patches of unburnt areas were left, which helped species survive. “There are no winners in fires like this,” he said. “These fires are homogenising the landscape. They benefit no species. “This is a harbinger of a bleak future for our wildlife. They have set back conservation in Australia for a very long period, but [the fires] are a sign of an even more bleak future ahead. Because of climate change, they will become more frequent and more severe. It’s a sad time for conservation in Australia.” He said it was “quite likely” the fires would have caused some extinctions but “we won’t know until after this summer ends”. “There’s an obligation now to do immediate reconnaissance for these species.” Legge offered other examples. The endangered Hastings River mouse, she said, had had about 40% of its known distribution “toasted”. Fire has also covered about a third of the range of the vulnerable rufous scrub-bird. “Even some species that are not snuffed out completely will struggle in the coming months,” she said. “I think this is the end for a number of species.” One estimate of the number of animals affected by the fires has come from the University of Sydney ecologist Prof Chris Dickman. Using previous research compiled in 2007 on the impact of land clearing in New South Wales, Dickman estimated that about 480 million mammals, birds and reptiles had been affected – but not necessarily all killed. His estimate did not include bats, which are susceptible to fires and are also critical for moving around seeds and pollination. “There is a suite of small animals that live on the forest floor,” he said. “If the cover is removed, then foxes and cats move in and they use the burned areas as open hunting arenas.” As the fires moved into Kosciuszko national park, he was now concerned about the endangered mountain pygmy possum. One important factor, he said, was the ecological role that many affected animals played. Bandicoots and poteroos help to move fungal spores around after fires that promote regrowth. If those animals die, that “ecological service” goes with them. Prof Brendan Wintle, a conservation ecologist at the University of Melbourne, said the scale and timing of the fires was “terrifying”. “If this is what we are seeing now are the beginnings of changes due to climate change, then what are we looking at 2C or 4C? I don’t think we can get our heads around what that could be like. This is not the new normal but it’s a transition to something we have not experienced before. “This is really concerning, not just for the impact that this event will have, but the prospect of this happening on a regular basis is really quite terrifying, and it will be to the point where forest ecosystems have changed to have a different character. When they change you definitely lose species.” Wintle said species such as the yellow-bellied glider and the greater glider, already threatened by climate change, would be severely affected. “These species require large old trees to den and they can’t survive without at least some large old living trees in their range.” He said East Gippsland was a stronghold for the two species but it appeared that “vast swathes” of habitat had been burned in recent days. Much of the known range of the endangered brush-tailed rock wallaby – a species already “right on the edge of extinction” – had also been burned, he said. Three-quarters of threatened species in Australia are plants, many of which exist in only small pockets, such as the dark-bract banksia and the blue-top sun orchid. “You can lose the lot in one big fire,” Wintle said. “If the timing is wrong, or the fire is too hot, you can also lose the seed bank and that’s then another species on the extinction list.” Prof Richard Kingsford, director of the University of New South Wales Centre for Ecosystem Science, said the fires would rob many bird species of vital old-growth trees they need to breed. Fire had taken away the invertebrate bugs the birds feed on, and that food source would not return until there was significant rain. “There are a whole lot of things that are ecologically off the scale,” he said. “We won’t really know how much of a tipping point these fires have been, but the scale in terms of extent and severity I think will be a serious problem for many, many species. It will set back biodiversity in our forests for decades. “You have these incredibly savage blows and these animals have not evolved to cope with it. These fires are not, in the scheme of things, natural. “We don’t see these smaller animals being incinerated. There is a silent death going on.”"
" While the ubiquitous garden cross spider (Araneus diadematus) perishes in late autumn, another species of orb-weaver remains active throughout the winter. Common and widespread, Zygiella x-notata is typically found close to human habitation, its webs strung under guttering, and spanning door and window frames. Though similar in appearance to the two-dimensional, concentric-circle webs constructed by its more familiar relative, its orbs usually have a distinctive wedge-shaped segment missing from an upper quadrant, hence the spider’s common name, missing-sector orb-weaver. One afternoon I sat and watched a female spinning a web across my kitchen windowpane. She had already secured anchor lines to the uPVC frame and was methodically running out radial filaments like bicycle spokes, to form the foundation of the structure. Crabbing out her striped legs, she used the tarsal claws at the end of each appendage to grip and tension the silk as it was extruded from the spinnerets on the underside of her abdomen. Once the radii were complete, it took her just under an hour to overlay them. Beginning at the hub, she created a wide-spaced spiral of non-adhesive thread that allowed her to move about the web with ease. Next she worked inwards, weaving a more closely spaced spiral of sticky capture silk, the gap between each coil directly proportional to the distance between the spider’s back legs and spinnerets. In Britain, spiders are more commonly associated with Halloween than the festive season, but in Germany, Poland and Ukraine it’s customary to hang arachnid ornaments on the Christmas tree. This tradition is inspired by an eastern European folktale in which spiders adorn the bare branches of a fir with silver gossamer – the inspiration for tinsel. As the street lamps flickered on, the web bedecking my window shimmered with the lustre of mother of pearl. Illuminated by the bright LED light, the spider’s abdomen had a silvery sheen, an ethereal effect caused by light-reflecting guanine crystals beneath the skin – the same crystalline substance that gives fish scales their iridescent appearance. Superstition dictates that it’s bad luck to leave decorations up after Twelfth Night, but this living jewel and her handiwork won’t be coming down on Sunday."
"The scaly-foot snail is one of Earth’s strangest creatures. It lives more than 2,300 metres below the surface of the sea on a trio of deep-sea hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. Here it has evolved a remarkable form of protection against the crushing, grim conditions found at these Stygian depths. It grows a shell made of iron. Discovered in 1999, the multi-layered iron sulphide armour of Chrysomallon squamiferum – which measures a few centimetres in diameter – has already attracted the interest of the US defence department, whose scientists are now studying its genes in a bid to discover how it grows its own metal armour. The researchers will have to move quickly, however, for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has just added the snail to its list of threatened species. German and Chinese industrial groups have revealed plans to explore the seabed around two of the three vents that provide homes for scaly-foot snails. Should they proceed, and mine the seabed’s veins of metals and minerals, a large chunk of the snail’s home base will be destroyed and the existence of this remarkable little creature will be threatened. “On land, we are already exploiting mineral resources to the full,” says Jean-Baptiste Jouffray, of Stockholm University. “At the same time, the need for rare elements and metals is becoming increasingly important to supply green technologies such as wind and solar power plants. “And so industrialists are looking to the seabed where it is now technologically and economically feasible to mine for minerals. Hence the arrival of threats to creatures like the scaly-foot snail.” Jouffray is the lead author of an analysis, published last week in the journal One Earth, which involved synthesising 50 years of data from shipping, drilling, aquaculture, and other marine industries and which paints an alarming picture of the impact of future exploitation of the oceans. This threat comes not just from seabed mining – which is set to expand dramatically in coming years – but from fish farming, desalination plant construction, shipping, submarine cable laying, cruise tourism and the building of offshore wind farms. This is “blue acceleration”, the term that is used by Jouffray and his co-authors to describe the recent rapid rise in marine industrialisation, a trend that has brought increasing ocean acidification, marine heating, coral reef destruction, and plastic pollution in its wake. As they state in their paper: “From the shoreline to the deep sea, the blue acceleration is already having major social and ecological consequences”. Another illustration of blue acceleration is provided by seabed grabbing, state the authors. Article 76 of the UN convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS) allows countries to claim seabed that lies beyond the 200 miles of a nation’s exclusive economic zone. Since the first claim under Article 76 was made in 2001, 83 countries have made submissions. Put together, these claims account for more than 37 million sq km of seabed, an area more than twice the size of Russia. Many seabed grabbers include small island states that are trying to become large ocean states in the process. For example, the Cook islands in the South Pacific has claimed an area of seabed that is 1,700 times its land surface. “The extension of the continental shelf is therefore not only transforming the geopoltical landscape, it is also substantially shrinking the area designated as the common heritage of humankind,” states the report. Examples of the conflicts that could ensue because of the blue acceleration include the disruption of key fish stocks by drilling for gas or oil offshore; pipelines that prevent trawl fishing; and offshore wind farms that disturb tourism. Norway provides a stark demonstration of likely future conflicts. It aims to bring about fivefold rises both in salmon farming and cruise tourism in its waters over coming years while also building more and more offshore wind farms and more and more offshore gas and oil platforms. Seabed mining for minerals is also scheduled to begin. This saturation of ocean space renders Norwegian waters as being highly vulnerable to shocks, states the report. The South China Sea is another potential flashpoint. It is a key gateway in the region’s network of undersea telecommunication cables; a third of the world’s shipping passes through it; while half the world’s fishing boats operate in its waters – which are disputed variously by China, Malaysia, Vietnam and others. Should armed conflict break out here over any of these issues, there would be a far-reaching impact on the world’s economy. “The relevance of the ocean for humanity’s future is undisputed,” states the report. “However, addressing the diversity of claims, their impacts and their interactions, will require effective governance.” To achieve this, the authors call for greater accountability to be imposed on those financing the fundamental changes that are now being made to Earth’s oceans. These include both banks and governments. In addition, the vulnerability of small island states needs to be addressed, it adds: “Navigating the blue acceleration in a just and sustainable way requires particular emphasis on the implications of increased ocean use across the globe – and how these claims could have an impact on the economic safety and wellbeing of vulnerable communities and social groups.” "
"A good hour before sunrise, two song thrushes were in full voice in a small copse by the railway line. A little burst of this, a little snatch of that. What stirred them into pouring out attention-seeking nocturnes now? This was a time when tawny owl talons might be reaching for their last supper of the night. Out to the west, false dawn had begun at dusk the day before. The town’s street lamps, the glow-worms of winter, had fired the sky with a luminosity like dying embers. A far greater stimulus came from four blazing moons at the birds’ backs. A bank of security beams from the yard of an industrial estate whitened the trees, seeped into the hedgerow and lit the pale grass of the neighbouring field. This illuminated landscape was one of disorientating contrasts, the spotlights exposing every feature facing the factory to their remorseless glare, while all else was lost in deep shade. I stood before a stumpy tree that still held many of its leaves, curled like crinkled baubles. I could not fathom its species by vision alone in this bewildering chiaroscuro world, though I guessed at sycamore. This was an environment that mixed certainty and hunches. A few hundred metres on, I escaped into the comforting evenness of semi-darkness, where I could see that I couldn’t see. Thrush song sprinkled gently from far behind, and I looked back to find that distance had shrunk the harsh flares of the industrial estate to pinprick spots. The distraction broke my concentration; no sooner had I turned back than a teasel head came up at my thigh, taking hold with a disturbing animal-like force, tugging at my trouser leg, angrily insistent. Out to the east, colourful stars shone still at the end of this cloudy night, a vertical column of four reddish-orange lights rising above the wooded ridge. I joined the dots unthinkingly. These lights part-delineated the 244-metre-high mast of the Sandy Heath transmitter, a beacon for three counties, one that could be seen for 20 miles around. Would a migrating bird be lured by these guiding stars? Or could it recognise fakes in the dark?"
"It is one of the country’s top predators, with a 2.4-metre (8ft) wingspan and a preference for plucking fish from the ocean. So a young sea eagle’s choice of landlocked Oxfordshire as its home is unexpected. More surprising still is that the bird has lived for four months almost completely unnoticed by the public close to the M40 and the commuter belt. The eagle, known as G3-93, is one of six satellite-tracked specimens released on to the Isle of Wight last summer, when they became England’s first resident sea eagles, or white-tailed eagles, for 250 years. “He thinks he’s a red kite,” said Steve Egerton-Read, a project officer for the reintroduction programme led by Forestry England and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation. “Like all young birds, he tries to learn from other birds. In the absence of other eagles, he’s learning from red kites. He flies around picking up bits of dead stuff – dead rabbits, dead game birds.” Scavenging carrion is normal for young sea eagles, which rarely learn to hunt live animals in their first year. According to Egerton-Read, G3-93 is living on private land where the bird is safe from persecution by humans. “Oxfordshire is full of game shoots but there’s no ill-will towards it and the landowners are very pleased to have another exciting bird to add to their list,” he said. “I don’t have many concerns for their safety over southern England and there is much more food for them here than in Scotland.” In six months since the six eagles’ reintroduction into England, their tags have revealed their contrasting fates. One bird died shortly after release during a prolonged wet spell. It has not yet had a postmortem to reveal its cause of death. Another, named Culver, was tracked cruising over central London on a day-trip from the Isle of Wight. Unfortunately its tag failed and the bird is feared dead because it has not been spotted since. Barely one in three young eagles survive to adulthood so to have four of six surviving into 2020 was a very positive start, Egerton-Read said. Previous attempts to reintroduce sea eagles have been scuppered by fears they would terrorise pigs and lambs, but the current specimens appear to have melted into busy southern England. There have been relatively few reliable public sightings, although there was one unconfirmed report that an eagle devouring roadkill was narrowly missed by a lorry. Three of the eagles remain on the Isle of Wight. G3-18, a female, returns every day to a feeding station to take the fish Egerton-Read puts out. Another female, G3-24, and a male, G2-74, are living in the same woodland, leading to hopes that they may eventually form a mating pair. White-tailed eagles take five years to reach maturity, and even then may not breed successfully for another two or three years. The project aims to release as many as 60 eagles in southern England over the next four years. The birds are taken as chicks from nests in Scotland, where there are now 150 pairs after the birds were reintroduced from Norway in the 1970s. It took 30 years for the first chick to fledge in Scotland but Egerton-Read hopes the English reintroduction will be quicker. “If we’re lucky, by 2030 we might get eight to 10 breeding pairs,” he said. Egerton-Read said the project would inform the public if the English eagles began appearing regularly at accessible sites so they could be watched and admired. They may become more visible in the summer when they become more active, soaring on thermals. “I remember 20 years ago buzzards were a rare sight in this part of the world,” he said. “I’m really looking forward to the day people look up and go, ‘Oh, another eagle.’ That will be a success.”"
"Virgin births took place on our dining table at Christmas. After a frost-free December, I had cut the last rosebuds from the garden and by Christmas Eve they had opened enough to make a table decoration. It was left forgotten on the windowsill until Twelfth Night, when the withered flowers, infested with rose aphids (Macrosiphum rosae) and sticky with honeydew, were about to be consigned to the compost heap. Unnoticed, overwintering aphid eggs had experienced a premature spring. What followed was spectacular, thanks to these insects’ capacity for parthenogenesis, asexual reproduction from an unfertilised egg, without male involvement. When they emerge from an egg they are all females, multiplying via virgin birth, cloning themselves with production-line efficiency: a rosarian’s nightmare. It only takes one greenfly hatchling to start a population explosion. I watched over the course of an afternoon. First a small, elongated blob appeared at the tip of a mother’s abdomen, swelling into an infant whose legs finally extended as she lowered it on to the rose stem. Throughout, the mother’s stylet, acting like a hypodermic syringe, tapped the rose’s sugary sap: seamless feeding and breeding, each newborn gravid with developing embryos for the next generation, even before inserting its own stylets for the first time. Scores of aphids were aligned head-to-tail along the flower stems but their food source was dying, so some had transitioned into the dispersal phase of their life cycle, when winged adults take flight in search of a fresh host plant. This would be the moment when gardeners hope salvation will arrive, in the form of natural predators like hoverfly, ladybird and lacewing larvae that wreak havoc on greenfly populations, or wasps that can’t resist eating these sweet treats. Our precocious Christmas population would never reach the final step in the breeding cycle, when males appear in autumn and fertilise the new generation of overwintering eggs that females will lay, before dying. I dropped the dead roses in the garden compost bin. A wren was searching for food among withered stems of last summer’s flowers: for every aphid egg it finds, there will be thousands fewer greenfly on the roses next summer."
"﻿Extinction Rebellion is threatening legal action against counter-terrorism police for what it said was the illegal listing of the group as an extremist ideology in a guide designed to help stop terrorist violence. The Guardian revealed on Friday that counter-terrorism police had placed the non-violent protest group on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to the authorities running the Prevent anti-radicalisation programme. Police now say that was an error. Amnesty International condemned the decision on Saturday as criticism grew and questions remained about how Extinction Rebellion (XR) came to be included in the guide alongside neo-Nazi and terrorist groups. The climate emergency campaign group was included in a 12-page document produced by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) titled “Safeguarding young people and adults from ideological extremism”. XR has instructed lawyers. Jules Carey, who acted for XR when it successfully struck down police protest bans in the courts last year, told the Guardian that the latest guidance was unlawful. “It is extraordinary that Counter Terrorism Policing South East have added Extinction Rebellion to the list of terrorist groups and extremist organisations that the Prevent strategy was set up to deal with. “The guidance issued by the CTPSE is clearly unlawful. It constitutes an unlawful interference with human rights including free speech, right to assemble and enjoyment of a private life. “The guidance is clearly designed to harm Extinction Rebellion and cast those who support the movement as domestic extremists. It is a glaring example of the sort of overzealous policing we have come to expect around protests. Being referred to Prevent could have long-lasting and life-changing consequences for a young school activist.” After inquiries by the Guardian police said they were recalling the guidance and that XR had been included in error in the guide, which was distributed to police, government and teachers in November 2019. Carey, of Bindmans solicitors, said: “It is not sufficient that CTPSE have sought to recall the guide from those that they shared it with. The advice in the guide … itself needs to be formally withdrawn and any decision taken to refer an activist of XR to Prevent needs to be urgently reversed.”  Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s campaigns director, said the police guidance added to longstanding concerns about Prevent. “It’s deeply shocking that the police ever seriously considered classifying peaceful climate crisis protesters as extremists. To see that schoolchildren were effectively going to be profiled under these proposed measures, just deepens our shock. “Given that children are potentially those who will be most affected by the climate emergency, it’s vital that they are able to speak out on these issues without this heavy-handed and entirely disproportionate police attention. This episode only adds to our existing concerns about Prevent, which is a highly dubious scheme sorely in need of a proper, independent and impartial review.” Prevent is the the government’s anti-radicalisation programme. It is intended to spot people at risk of becoming involved in terrorism and divert them away from extremism. Concerns have been raised that it impinges on freedom of thought and speech. Its supporters, which include the government and the police, say it is vital to stop the flow of recruits to Islamist and extreme rightwing violence, but it has been accepted that changes may be needed. A review of Prevent that is due to report later this year is expected to be delayed after its original chair stepped down following criticism and a legal challenge. The police document revealed by the Guardian said that issues to look out for included people who speak in “strong or emotive terms about environmental issues like climate change, ecology, species extinction, fracking, airport expansion or pollution”. The guide advises readers to listen and look out for young people who “neglect to attend school” or “participate in planned school walkouts” – an allusion to the school strikes for the climate, a global movement of which the activist Greta Thunberg is a lead proponent. Thousands of UK pupils and millions worldwide walked out of school last year in protest at government inaction on the climate crisis. The document also flags young people taking part in non-violent direct action, such as sit-down protests, banner drops or “writing environmentally themed graffiti”. The disclosure that XR has been listed alongside proscribed groups such as National Action and al-Muhajiroun is being blamed on police in the south-east of England rather than a decision at the national level. Clare Collier of the civil rights group Liberty said: “This is a startling example of how Prevent stifles free speech, labels dissent as dangerous and gives the police sweeping powers to monitor non-violent, non-criminal behaviour. The definition of extremism under Prevent is fundamentally flawed and so wide that thousands – including children – are swept up by it. “Protest is fundamental to democracy and our ability to stand up to power. This year alone Extinction Rebellion, the school strikes and other protests have shown how valuable protest is for bringing about change. We corrode the right to protest at our peril.” A spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain, which has long criticised how Prevent operates, said: “This case illustrates the serious flaws in the Prevent programme and a kneejerk reaction to create a list of undesirables, drawn up by divisive ideologues. The sooner a replacement independent reviewer can be found, the better.” CTPSE would not answer questions about how XR came to be included. On Friday DCS Kath Barnes, the head of CTPSE, said: “I would like to make it quite clear that we do not classify Extinction Rebellion as an extremist organisation. The inclusion of Extinction Rebellion in this document was an error of judgment and we will now be reviewing all of the contents as a result. “It was produced by CTPSE to assist our statutory partners – including police forces and government organisations – in identifying people who may be vulnerable as a result of their links to some organisations. “The document was designed for a very specific audience who understand the complexities of the safeguarding environment we work within and who have statutory duties under Prevent. We are in the process of confirming who it has been shared with and recalling it. “We as counter-terrorism policing, along with our partners, have a responsibility to protect vulnerable people. Officers are trained to spot those who may be vulnerable, and the membership of an organisation that supports environmental or animal welfare issues alone would not be a trigger.”"
"The world must eradicate pesticide use, prioritise nature-based farming methods and urgently reduce water, light and noise pollution to save plummeting insect populations, according to a new “roadmap to insect recovery” compiled by experts. The call to action by more than 70 scientists from across the planet advocates immediate action on human stress factors to insects which include habitat loss and fragmentation, the climate crisis, pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species. Phasing out synthetic pesticides and fertilisers used in industrial farming and aggressive greenhouse gas emission reductions are among a series of urgent “no-regret” solutions to reverse what conservationists have called the “unnoticed insect apocalypse”. Alongside these measures, scientists must urgently establish which herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids, predators and pollinators are priority species for conservation, according to a new paper published in Nature Ecology & Evolution. The animals are crucial to the healthy functioning of ecosystems by recycling nutrients, serving as pollinators and acting as food for other wildlife. The paper comes amid repeated warnings about the threat of human-driven insect extinction causing a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, with more than 40% of insect species declining and a third endangered, according to the first worldwide scientific review, published in February 2019. In July 2017, researchers warned human overpopulation and overconsumption were driving the sixth mass extinction event in world history, pointing to the “biological annihilation” of wildlife. Lead author Prof Jeff Harvey of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said: “As scientists, we want to gather all available knowledge and put it to action together with land managers, policymakers and everyone else involved.  “Essentially, we are thinking strategically and this is novel. Now and down the road, all to reverse insect declines. “Most importantly, we hope that end-users and land managers now can use this roadmap in, for instance, farming, habitat management and urban development as a template for true insect recovery.” The scientists have called on governments to follow the example of Germany, which announced a €100m action plan for insect protection in September 2019, adding that there is a strong consensus among experts that the decline of insects, other arthropods and global biodiversity is a serious threat that society must address. In the short term, the roadmap advocates immediate action on rewilding and conservation programmes, avoiding and mitigating the impact of alien species and prioritising imports that are not produced at the cost of species-rich ecosystems. Enhancing citizen science projects to improve data quality and inform academic study was also deemed a priority. “Most importantly, we should not wait to act until we have addressed every key knowledge gap. We currently have enough information on some key causes of insect decline to formulate no-regret solutions whilst more data are compiled for lesser known taxa and regions and long-term data are aggregated and assessed,” the roadmap states. “Implementation should be accompanied by research that examines impacts, the results of which can be used to modify and improve the implementation of effective measures. Furthermore, such a ‘learning-by-doing’ approach ensures that these conservation strategies are robust to newly emerging pressures and threats. We must act now.” In the long term, the scientists are calling for the establishment of an international body to document and monitor the effects of the roadmap on insect biodiversity under the auspices of existing bodies such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Public-private partnerships to restore, protect and create new insect habitats and manage threats are also advocated by the roadmap. Coauthors on the roadmap for insect conservation recovery originate from Europe, North America, South and Central America, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Asia. They include biology professor Dave Goulson, known for his books on the ecology of bees and other insects, and scientist Hans de Kroon, renowned for his work on insect biomass decline. In February 2019, analysis published in the journal Biological Conservation found that the total mass of insects had fallen by 2.5% a year for the last 25-30 years, with intensive agriculture the primary driver of falling populations. Light pollution has also emerged as an overlooked driver of plummeting insect populations by luring them to predators, affecting the development of juvenile insects and disrupting light and dark cycles, according to a study published in November 2019. Scientists said insect deaths could be reduced by switching off unnecessary lights.

"It would be “kinder to shoot” the hundreds of thousands of unwanted male dairy calves due to be born in Ireland this year, rather than export them to the Middle East or let them die on the farm, experts have told the Guardian. Irish farmers have hit a streak of gold on dairy exports, and as a result the industry has rapidly expanded, with the national dairy herd rising from about 1m in 2010 to 1.6m this year. But that creates a whole new problem. Dairy cows generally give birth every year in order to maintain their milk output. But male dairy calves are no use to the farmer as they cannot produce milk, which means that Ireland will need to deal with as many as 800,000 unwanted male calves this year, in what has been described by the Irish agricultural press as a “calf tsunami”. The situation is further complicated by Ireland’s “compact calving” system, which sees most calves born in a 12-week period from February to April, and the swift removal of calves from their mothers. Both increase the need for extra short-term labour, which can be costly or hard to find.  The Irish beef trade has formerly been a useful outlet for unwanted dairy calves, but demand last year was sluggish, and selective breeding increasingly means that dairy calves may not be suitable for beef anyway. Exporting the calves is another option. Although campaigners are opposed to the trade, the Irish government has described it as “a vital safety valve for the beef sector”. The only alternative is to shoot the calf at birth, or to let calves die of neglect. In 2015–16 New Zealand, another country with a large dairy industry, was hit by the male calf scandal when videos and reports of starved and abused male dairy calves were widely circulated by welfare organisations.  “The danger of having so many calves in 2020, on top of the existing pressures, means there is an emergency welfare case to be made, although no one wants to talk about it, for killing the calves on a one-off basis at three or four days old,” said a senior figure in Ireland’s state agricultural network. The source spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity for fear they might lose their job. “We know there is going to be suffering. We know the farmers can’t manage and we need to offer a realistic solution to ease that suffering, for the calves and the farmers,” the source said. “Vets often say they are only called to treat female calves. The whole reason New Zealand is in the situation of killing calves at four days old is because they had the same problems with valueless male dairy calves about four years ago. “Vets are not called to sick pigs [in Ireland],” the source added. “And this is the way we are going with male calves.” Calves and pigs are worth significantly less than the cost of a vet, so it can be cheaper to simply let them die. Difficult as the decision is, the source said it was preferable to letting them “die in their own scour [diarrhoea], which is what is happening now and we know is going to get worse”. Although most dairy industry professionals refused to openly discuss the possibility of a cull, Cork based cattle vet Bill Cashman spoke on the record. “When a male calf has no value, or is a net cost, with the best will in the world a farmer, especially when under intense day and night work [pressure], will prioritise female calf care over the bulls.” Although Cashman said it was a “wanton waste” to kill any animal at birth, the immediate priority was to ensure that “males are not suffering from a lack of care and disease” or spreading those diseases, and “that means a cull at one or two days old. I would not leave them longer.” Asked how a cull might work, Cashman said, in line with the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe policy, he would prefer to see it happen on the farm, to avoid transport, by lethal injection. “It’s instantaneous. A visit could be made every second day [during calving season.]” The option of exporting the calves may provide a financial return for farmers, but campaigners have queried the welfare implications of sending young, unweaned calves on long journeys by ship or truck. The minimum age is supposed to be 14 days, but the same source told the Guardian that it looks as if some farmers are registering calves as born earlier, in an attempt to get them off the farm as quickly as possible. European veal farms are the main export destination for younger calves, while older animals – male and female – tend to sell to Turkey, Libya, Morocco, Lebanon, Russia, Tunisia, Rwanda or Kosovo for beef and dairy use. Mistreatment has been well documented. In a 2018 report on farm animal welfare the European Court of Auditors noted Ireland was guilty of infringing calf transport rules. A 2016 investigation by Compassion in World Farming showed that some journeys were lasting over 27 hours, in cramped conditions with no drinking facilities. In May 2019footage taken at a at a French control post appeared in Cherbourg by animal activist group Eyes on Animals appeared to show calf mistreatment. There is also concern about slaughter conditions in non-EU countries. But the Irish government has repeatedly pledged its support for the export sector and has encouraged companies to form their own representative organisation. In January 2017, Ireland’s minister for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), Michael Creed, reportedly told the Irish Farmers’ Association annual meeting that the live export trade was “critically important”. There has been a rise in the number of cattle exported over recent years although the value of industry for livestock – at about €110m (£94m) a year – has declined 6% year-on-year. “It is not boosting the economy,” Caroline Rowley, from Compassion in World Farming, said. “It is not stimulating prices, live export volumes are going up each year but factory prices are not following. It is not helping the average livestock farmer. The only winners in this outdated industry are the exporters.” Colorado-based animal science expert Dr Mary Temple Grandin told the Guardian that from a welfare perspective slaughtering very young calves is likely more humane than a long journey by sea without milk replacer. The drawback, she said, was a potential food waste issue. Asked what happens to their slaughtered calves, New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries said in an email they are “typically processed for pet food”, which goes some way towards addressing Grandin’s waste concerns. Although no farmer would endorse the idea of an emergency calf cull on the record, there was agreement on individual calf neglect issues. Denis Drennan is a dairy farmer and committee chairman with the Irish Creamery Milk Supplier Association. Drennan, who has 60 dairy cows, summed up the reaction of many farmers to the idea of a cull, saying if he was shooting animals at birth, he was not a farmer. Asked if male calves are sometimes left to die, or whether there are farmers who only call a vet for a female calf, Drennan said yes. Where a vet might cost about €150 at night, domestic prices for calves, which can earn farmers anything from €30 to €80 per head at auction, reportedly fell as low as €0.50 per head last year. Live exporters, meanwhile, estimate their 2020 prices would stay in the €30 to €60 range.  Replying to questions about a potential emergency calf cull Ireland’s DAFM said by email that it “continues to engage with and work closely with stakeholders in relation to the incremental increase in the number of calves born on the dairy farms over the past few years, with a focus on rearing, management and market opportunities for such calves, including opportunities for intra-community trade to other EU member states.” The department’s statement went on to say that “in addition to its direct oversight of animals presented for export”, it will “continue its range of inspections and controls on farms and at sales to monitor compliance with animal welfare standards”. One result of that engagement appears to be a December DAFM announcement that Irish government veterinary inspectors “will accompany calves from Ireland to the control posts in Cherbourg”, without prior warning. It said too that rubber teat water drinkers will be mandatory for unweaned calves from 1 December 2020. Reacting to the new rules, Eyes on Animals’ Nicola Glen said she was pleased to see the “serious welfare issues associated with the transport of Irish calves” were finally receiving proper attention. However, she said it was unclear how the vet checks would work in practice and that although the new rubber teat rule was an improvement on the existing system of hard-to-access metal pipes, December 2020 was too far away. Eyes on Animals will continue its inspections until it sees concrete results, she added."
"The biggest wheat farmer in Australia, Ron Greentree, is again facing charges of illegal land clearing, this time in relation to a property in western New South Wales.  Greentree, the former chair of Graincorp, along with his business partner Ken Harris and their companies trading under the name the Greentree Partnership, are facing 32 charges of unauthorised land clearing at Boolcarrol, near Moree, which is alleged to have occurred between 2016 and 2019. NSW authorities allege the activities at Boolcarrol resulted in the loss of more than 1,000 hectares of native vegetation between December 2016 and January 2019. The NSW authorities allege that illegal land clearing using bulldozers and ploughs resulted in the loss of coolabah, poplar box and open woodland that was the habitat for several threatened species including the striped-faced dunnart, koalas and several bird species, such as brolgas and black cockatoos. The charges involve offences under the old Native Vegetation Act and the Local Land Services Act, which replaced it in 2017. Set down for August, it will be one of the first cases to test the NSW government’s new laws. There has been a concerted campaign from some Moree farmers and sections of the media to get the NSW government to drop cases brought under the old laws, arguing that they are causing stress to farmers during the drought. However, this case indicates the government is still pushing forward with some of the more serious allegations of land clearing under the old laws. There has already been separate legal action about whether to hear the cases against the two farmers separately or together. Harris had argued for separate trials because there has been a dispute over the partnership since early 2017 and few communications between Harris and Greentree. Justice Nicola Pain noted that between December 2016 and January 2019, when the offences were alleged to have occurred, Greentree had management of the farms while Harris had been to Boolcarrol no more than six times. Harris declined to comment. Greentree did not respond to requests for comment, nor did his lawyer. Greentree has been connected to farming controversies in the past, including some related to land clearing. In 2004 he was the first person convicted for illegal clearing of a protected wetland under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and he and his company were fined $450,000. This conviction was for clearing 100 hectares of his Windella property near Moree. The area was one of four privately owned sections of the internationally recognised Gwydir wetlands which were listed under the Ramsar Convention in 1999. He had also been facing charges in NSW. In 1998, his private company Prime Grain and Limthono, the company of a business partner, Bruce Harris, were the subject of the first prosecution for illegal clearing under the NSW Native Title Vegetation Act. This involved clearing 210 hectares of the property, Willalee, also near Moree. Both companies were convicted but received only a light fine. Last year Greentree’s Queensland business partner was fined $450,000 for illegal clearing of 2,875 hectares of native vegetation at Strathmore Station in Queensland’s Gulf country. Scott Harris, a distant relative of Ken Harris, owns the property, while Greentree is involved in farming operations to grow the northernmost cotton crop in Australia. Scott Harris is now awaiting a decision from the federal government on his plan to clear 2,000 hectares at another property, Kingvale, in Cape York. The former Newman government in Queensland had given approval for the vast property to be cleared despite concerns from environmental groups that runoff would damage the Great Barrier Reef. The federal government must also approve the clearing because it is in the Barrier Reef catchment. A decision is expected any day. The looming Kingvale decision has been highly controversial. Documents released under freedom of information laws revealed four Coalition senators from Queensland lobbied then-environment minister Josh Frydenberg in 2018 to approve it. The approval was then overturned by the federal court on technical grounds and the decision must be remade by the current environment minister, Sussan Ley. Meanwhile the Queensland Department of Environment and Science is taking court action as a result of an investigation in 2016, when the Olkola people complained to the government that they believed Kingvale Station may be in breach of the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act."
"Dawdling along the valley, low morning sun dazzling, shaded field-margins laced with frost, an impulse seized me at the Shropshire border to revisit Sycharth. Here’s one of the most revered, resonant places in Welsh history, where our national hero, warrior and statesman Owain Glyndŵr had his seat. His court bard, Iolo Goch, left a vivid portrait of his mansion and its courtly life in the last decade of the 14th century, just before the great insurrection Glyndŵr led against corrupt and insolent English rule. I’ve come here often over the past 50 years – for its associations, and for the inherent beauty of the place in its now-tranquil Marches valley. Goch’s description of Glyndŵr’s court enables you to visualise it as it was: the four marvellous pillars on a green Norman motte supporting a fine, moat-encircled, timbered house; the surrounding orchards, hayfields, vineyards, deer park, a mill, dovecotes, a rabbit warren, fishponds: “A’i dir bwrdd a’i adar byw, / Peunod, crehyrod hoywryw” (“His land a table where birds dwell, / Peacocks, high-stepping herons”). An idyll – but a precarious one in treacherous times. In May 1403, with Glyndŵr away on his victorious progress through Wales, the 15-year-old Prince Hal – who became England’s Henry V – arrived here at the head of a strong force on a punitive foray from Chester. He razed the empty Sycharth, with its culture, opulence and hospitality. Come here in the summer and the landscape clearly attests to its fate. Fireweed still blooms across the bailey. Archaeological excavations revealed the smoke-blackened foundations of Glyndŵr’s great hall, in the shadow of mighty oaks that first took root on the motte at the time of its destruction. This understated shrine – a single sign, a tiny car park – to a crucial chapter in Welsh history reveals itself not through ruins but to the imagination’s eye. I watched as a descendant of one of those strutting herons stalked out into the marsh where the fishponds lay. Its ash-grey plumage against bare trees and winter-grey grass blended perfectly with this landscape’s mood. He speared down at nothing, as young Hal and his soldiers did six centuries ago; unlike them, he glided solemnly, harmlessly away."
"One of Britain’s best-known bottled water companies is proposing to extend its bottling plant, which would lead to the loss of huge areas of woodland in a Yorkshire spa town. Harrogate Spring Water wants to expand its operations and build on a 1.6-hectare (four-acre) area of woodland. The woodland was planted 15 years ago by local schoolchildren, organisations and the Army Foundation college as part of centenary celebrations for the Harrogate Rotary club. The site, known as Rotary Wood, is an addition to Harrogate’s 40-hectare Pinewoods forest. Neil Hind, the Pinewoods Conservation Group (PCG) chair, said in the face of a climate emergency it was vital to preserve green spaces and mature trees, and not replace them with a factory producing bottled water. He said: “Harrogate Spring Water does a lot to share the name of Harrogate across the world, but is that benefit worth the loss of acres of woodland? We see no improvements or benefits that this planning application is going to give to the users of the Pinewoods.” Dan McAndrew, a principal ecologist at Harrogate borough council, said no evidence had been provided to show how the extension could be achieved without biodiversity loss – therefore the application could not be supported from an ecological perspective. Harrogate Spring is Britain’s oldest bottled water and is ranked the country’s number one premium water brand. The family-owned company prides itself on its green credentials, and says its Harrogate facility is one of the most environmentally efficient facilities in the world. It received outline planning permission for the development in 2017, but has now submitted a revised application for a building 40% larger than originally put forward. McAndrew said this proposed increase made it much less likely sufficient environmental compensation could be achieved on site. The PCG are concerned that the revised application does not include details of the number of trees that will be planted to replace those lost. Harrogate Spring Water said updated ecological surveys would address these concerns in due course. Nicky Cain, brand manager for the company, acknowledged that it was “emotive land”. She said: “We want to retain as much as possible and make sure that it is still available for the public to use and enjoy.” Cain said since naturally sourced water must be bottled at source, the company was limited in where it could expand in order to “remain competitive and grow the business”. She said some of the trees in the wood had failed to thrive, and that their plans would help improve accessibility to the site with new footpaths. Of the 1.86-hectare site, 0.8 hectares will be left as open space for public use, and will include paths, planting and sustainable drainage. Cain said the company had held public consultations throughout the process. She said: “We wanted to involve everybody, and try and reassure people that we would only do what’s in the town’s best interest. We have a requirement to grow in order to survive but at the same time, we don’t want to do that at the detriment of our environment and our community.” The Pinewoods, including the Rotary Wood, was given asset of community value status in 2015, which gives it additional protection from development. Terry Knowles is a member of Harrogate Rotary club and was chair of the PCG when the Rotary Wood was originally planted. He said he was “pretty horrified” to see the company’s plans to increase the size of their extension. Knowles said: “There are a lot of wild orchids on the site, and since we’ve put all the trees in there’s a lot more wildlife there. So it’s not only the fact that trees are going to be knocked down, but the fact that wildlife has been sustained in the area.” He estimates that up to 1,500 trees are at risk. Harrogate borough council previously approved a plan to cut the district’s carbon dioxide emissions by 40% by 2020, and recent plans include tree planting for every child. Council leader Richard Cooper said last year: “I believe it is the most radical environmental manifesto put forward by a borough council ever and will place us at the forefront of the green movement in the public sector.” A spokesman from Harrogate council, which owns the Rotary Wood site, said: “A revised application was submitted in December. “This amended application will now be considered through the normal planning process including consultation with statutory consultees and the public. It will then be presented before the planning committee at a date to be confirmed.”"
"UK homes will soon be able to plug into community wind and solar farms from anywhere in the country through the first energy tariff to offer clean electricity exclusively from community projects. The deal from Co-op Energy comes as green energy suppliers race to prove their sustainability credentials amid rising competition for eco-conscious customers and “greenwashing” in the market. The energy supplier will charge an extra £5 a month over Co-op’s regular tariff to provide electricity from community energy projects and gas which includes a carbon offset in the price.  Co-op, which is operated by Octopus Energy after it bought the business from the Midcounties Co-operative last year, will source the clean electricity for its new tariff directly from 90 local renewable energy generation projects across the UK, including the Westmill wind and solar farms in Oxfordshire. It plans to use all profits to reinvest in maintaining the community projects and building new ones. Phil Ponsonby, the chief executive of Midcounties Co-operative, said the tariff is the UK’s only one to be powered by 100% community-generated electricity and would ensure a fair price is paid to community generators too. Customers on the Community Power tariff will be able to “see exactly where it is being generated at small scale sites across the UK, and they know it is benefiting local communities”, he said. Co-op, which has about 300,000 customers, has set itself apart from a rising number of energy supply deals which are marked as 100% renewable, but are not as green as they seem. Consumer group Which? has found that many suppliers offer renewable energy tariffs but do not generate renewable electricity themselves or have contracts to buy any renewable electricity directly from generators. Instead, the “pale green” suppliers exploit a loophole in the energy market by snapping up cheap renewable energy certificates, without necessarily buying energy from renewables projects.  The certificates are issued by the regulator to renewable energy developers for each megawatt generated, but these can be sold separately from the electricity for a fraction of the price. Which? warned that these suppliers appear to be greenwashing their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers. A survey conducted last year found that one in 10 people believe that a renewables tariff means that the supplier generates at least some of its electricity from its own renewable energy projects. Ponsonby said the wind and solar schemes that generate electricity for the Community Power tariff “plough the profits they make back into their neighbourhoods or into helping other similar projects get off the ground”. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said being able to buy locally-sourced clean, green energy is “a massive jump in the right direction” which will help grow the UK’s green electricity capacity. “Investing in more local energy infrastructure and getting Britain’s homes run by the sun when it’s shining and the wind when it’s blowing can end our reliance on dirty fossil fuels sooner than we hoped,” he said. “Local people investing in local people means that we can all muck in and put the work in to decarbonise where governments and large companies are slow to.”"
"The muddy footpath along the woodland edge is submerged in water, and it’s too deep to be passable. I double back and climb the hill through the woods, my feet sinking into the soft floor of wet brown leaves. The track winds back to the main path, and a higher, drier stretch that looks out across the flooded valley. The pearlescent sky is reflected in the silvery greys of the large expanse of water. Grassy islands and banks emerge in the middle and, sitting on the bare trees that rise over them, are crows and birds of prey, including two red kites and two common buzzards. Thousands of ducks and geese swim and feed. Among a group of paddling Canada geese, shovelers and pintails is a single, newly arrived Bewick’s swan, its head underwater for much of the time as it searches for food. The movements of Sussex’s wintering Bewick’s swans have been fairly well documented. Some individuals have been tracked arriving in the Netherlands from Arctic Russia in November and December, before flying on to arrive at favoured local sites in the south of England, including here in the Arun valley. But the numbers wintering in Sussex have declined in recent years, it is thought because of warmer conditions on the continent further north and the reduction in the overall population. This weekend, on the 11-12 January, volunteers across north-west Europe will record sightings of Bewick’s and whooper swans for the five-yearly international swan census. As well as providing a clearer picture of population numbers, the coordinated count aims to identify important wintering areas and any changes in the habitats used by the birds. Two more gleaming white Bewick’s swans, with yellow triangles both sides of the base of their bills, swim into view and together the three birds paddle around and feed. Eventually, two of them climb out of the water on to a raised patch of ground to preen. A slender, brown bird of prey flaps past – a brown female or immature hen harrier, with its distinctive white rump. It flies fast and low, intent on getting somewhere, either to an area of drier grassland where it can hunt, or to its roost for the night."
"My brother-in-law Alan Christie, who has died aged 68 after suffering from a heart condition, was a proponent of corporate social responsibility and for many years the director of community affairs at Levi’s. He helped to pioneer work that set the tone for the way in which multinational businesses funded efforts to combat Aids. At Levi’s from 1988 to 2004, he expanded the company’s grant funding programme to support early projects to beat Aids and to promote education about Aids/HIV, particularly in southern Africa. Among the initiatives he supported was the Positive Lives project, a photographic portrayal of people affected by Aids that became a global phenomenon and was seen by millions. While at Levi’s he also founded, with the former European commissioner Étienne Davignon, a business network on corporate social responsibility called CSR Europe. Alan was born in St Andrews, Fife, to Alexander, a miner and trade unionist, and his wife, Jane (nee Barclay), who worked in a paper mill. After Kirkcaldy high school he went to Heriot Watt University, where his degree was in town planning but his education was in student politics. In 1977 he was elected Scottish president of the National Union of Students, and for two years from 1978-80 was deputy president of the NUS UK during the presidency of Trevor Phillips. From 1980 until 1983 he was secretary general of the British Youth Council, based in London, then moved to Brussels as secretary general of the Council of European National Youth Committees. There he met my sister, Moya Campbell, who in 2000 became his life partner and in 2008 his wife. In 1988, still in Brussels, he took up the job as director of community affairs at Levi’s and through that work in 1993 met Nelson Mandela, one of the proudest moments of his life. In 2006 he returned to the UK to become a director first at the Commission for Racial Equality and then at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, helping to shape the 2010 Equalities Act and working with businesses to promote human rights. He retired in 2015 and afterwards retained his trusteeship of the Runnymede Trust, the race equality thinktank, and volunteered briefly as a prison monitor before developing a serious heart condition.  A loyal Labour party and Rangers supporter, a devotee of Tunnock’s teacakes, a pretty terrible driver and a consummate player of Trivial Pursuit, to his friends he was a wise adviser. He is survived by Moya and by his sister, Loraine."
"The lane that climbs steeply through conifers from Cwm Penmachno relaxes finally on reaching the moor above, and dawdles for a narrow mile through peat hags to arrive at a road junction in the lonely heart of Migneint (“place of quagmires”). Eastwards, the B4407 broaches the moor to descend alongside an infant Afon Conwy. The experimental novelist BS Johnson (1933-73) wrote a remarkable “phantom hitchhiker” story about encountering a sheela-na-gig while driving across here on his way from Kilpeck in Herefordshire to the Llyn Peninsula one wild evening. Whenever I visit the remote abandoned tyddyn – now a bothy – of Cefn Garw, two miles across the moor by the Afon Serw, it returns to haunt me, as though Johnson’s story had invoked the tutelary spirit of this wild and watery place, more suited to soaring buzzards, scudding merlins and quartering kites than to human habitation. West and south, the B4407 passes the fine little rock outcrop of Carreg y Foel Gron above Llyn Du Bach before coming to Pont yr Afon Gam, where the road from Bala heads down to Llan Ffestiniog. This is bracing country. At that first lane junction after crossing the Afon Conwy watershed there is a mystery. It’s a well, sturdily reconstructed in 1846, bearing the carved exhortation “Yf a bydd ddiolchgar” (Drink and be thankful). It’s alongside one of the old drove routes from Wales to the English smithfields. But this well was not for cattle, or for pigs, though traces of a retaining compound for swine still abut the structure. The access to its stone basin is staggered, leading through interlocking baffles that fattened animals could not have negotiated. Ffynnon Eidda (Eidda’s well) is its name, and that’s a further mystery. Eidda may be related to local names for understated features on these moors. In summer, children from Llan pedal noisily up here to roll up their sleeves and retrieve coins flung by passing motorists into its chill, clear water. Fancifully, I think of the Elder Edda tale of Odin trading an eye for a drink from the well of wisdom. If sheela-na-gigs can appear on these moors, cannot Odin also?"
"The weight of winter cloud seemed to leave the whole landscape slumped in grey, but there was no hint of dullness to the morning. Among the pigeons and partridges and flights of finches were six marsh harriers, five kestrels and two owls. The predators were evenly spread, quartering the marsh or perched aloft and intent, so that I could hardly look in any direction without some returning sense of electric attention. They all seemed to be after voles and, in fact, I saw a kestrel and harrier each take one in turn, while a young heron, neck and beak poised over the field like some ritual dagger, was stalking the same sort of prey. Of them all, however, the hunting short-eared owls were most wonderful. The owl’s long wings were pale buff below, chequered ash-brown above. Their full span levered up and down rhythmically, but the upstroke was whipped so high and hard it installed a brief vacuum beneath each arm, then down softly on to that displaced air settled the downstroke. Over and over, with adjusting tilts to left and right, or when it came clean around to come straight at me in long level glides, the bird attacked the same lens of air just above the grasses. The action was so fluent it seemed automated and strangely at odds with the rest of the organism. For behind those wings, trailing like a loose rudder, were the buff-stockinged feet, while ahead of everything rode the head. It was fixed to a body via an enormous neck whose thickly feathered hood created an encircling bulge about the entire upper body and looked a fulcrum for the whole sweet mechanism. All its fine-tuned kinetics were ultimately at the service of two immense yellow eyes centred in a flattened facial disc. They were ringed in black and beamed down upon the grasses, on to which the bird intermittently collapsed like old clothes. Then the head would rotate back and forth, the eyes swivelling everywhere, and just occasionally I was swallowed too and an owl’s brain drank me down, so that for those moments I was more than an observer to this hunter’s morning."
"It would be tempting to just write: “Ditto. Same as last year. Nothing much has changed.” Because nothing much has, here on my patch by the river. I know what I’m likely to see when I head down here, give or take the odd kingfisher (not today) or treecreeper (yes today, spiralling quietly upward in and among the hawthorn). Siskins bother the alder-tops and a bullfinch toots mournfully from a sycamore thicket. A wintering little grebe, looking as small and vulnerable as a duckling, circles at the river’s edge. A roe deer kicks up its back end, flashing its scut. But on the other hand, in other ways, everything has changed. Everyone here is a little older, has learned a little more. A year’s worth of weather has blown through the woods. Most of these birds (long-tailed tits milling in the middle storey, blue tits making their rattlesnake alarm-calls, song thrushes maintaining a strong line in jibber-jabber from the tree-forks) won’t be the same birds as were here last year, though they wear the same colours and sing much the same songs. The world has turned. Everything is different. Some of the changes I can even see. Someone has flytipped a van-load of car tyres on the opposite side of the river: they slobber down the bank like a clutch of giant frogspawn. The great riven tree beside the dry stream-bed has split a bit wider open, and brambles have found their way inside the trunk. The warden has been busy, over winter, knitting new hedges. I stop at the fence that encloses the close-strimmed meadow upstream of the trees. To the left, on a branch overlooking the uncut scrub between the meadow and a car-radiator factory, a male kestrel is perched, grey head bowed as he studies the undergrowth for movement. To the right, as if put there for contrast, as in a parable or a story for children, a female sparrowhawk rises in widening circles, silencing the birdsong as she goes."
"The battle against plastic waste is being hindered by the poor information given to consumers about which product bottles can be recycled, a leading consumer group has warned. An analysis by Which? of labels on 20 common toiletries found the majority had no recycling information, despite most being at least partially recyclable. Only six had accurate and detailed labelling, telling users the bottles could be recycled, with specific instructions on how to do so. The analysis found that Head and Shoulders classic clean shampoo (500ml), L’Oreal Elvive Colour Protect conditioner (400ml) and Listerine Total Care mouthwash (500ml) had no clear recycling labels, despite being made of recyclable materials. While many brands fell short of the standards that the consumer rights champion expected, Carex’s Complete Original handwash (250ml) clearly displayed information about how to recycle the bottle which also encourages customers to do so. Radox Feel Refreshed shower gel (250ml) was picked out for similar praise. Recycling is well established in kitchen and grocery products, with Tesco announcing last week that it was removing shrink-wrapped multipacks of baked beans, soup and tuna from its supermarkets as part of a drive to reduce its use of plastic. However, Which? expressed concern that a lack of proper labelling was leading to large numbers of recyclable products ending up in landfill – with bathroom items a prime culprit. It found that, while 67% of people think recyclable packaging is important when shopping, 65% said they were not cutting back on plastics in the bathroom. A third said it was too difficult to replace bathroom products they regularly use. One in six (16%) said they don’t know how to cut back on bathroom plastic. Which? said the onus was now on leading brands to make significant changes to the way they approach the production of packaging and how they communicate with their customers. It also wants recycling labelling to be made mandatory. Natalie Hitchins, Which? head of home products and services, said: “Recycling and sustainability are a high priority for many consumers –so the lack of clear information on the products we looked at is inexcusable. Brands must take action to ensure bottles of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel are clearly labelled and can be disposed of in an efficient way.” The most recent official statistics for household recycling cover 2017, when the UK recorded a 45.7% recycling and composting rate. This was only a minor increase on 2016’s 45.2%. Wales had the highest recycling rate of the UK nations, at 57.6% in 2017. The figures suggest the UK has some way to go if it is to meet the EU’s 50% target for household waste."
"Seawater held within the square, sheltered confines of Plymouth’s King Point marina moves smoothly up and down with the tides, like a lift between two floors. As the surface descends, pale shapes can be seen scattered among the swags of seaweed, like handfuls of fresh plaster pressed against the exposed wet stone. Some are slim and oval, others plump as a pasty, crimped along one side with a sharp scalloped edge. I count almost 200 on a quick circuit of the harbour. These intriguing creatures are Pacific oysters – a non-native shellfish that is making itself at home in Britain’s coastal waters. Originally from Japan, Magallana gigas has been farmed for decades in the UK and across the globe. It was believed our seas were too cold for them to breed. However, wild populations have recently become established and are spreading rapidly in muddy estuaries and rocky bays around the West Country and beyond. The population at this boatyard in Millbay is relatively small compared with the thousands-strong congregations that have smothered stretches of shoreline in southern England with dense reefs of jagged shells. Fragile marine habitats, including areas at the mouth of the Yealm in Devon and Fowey in Cornwall, have become encrusted with serrated carpets, too hazardous to walk on without stout footwear. A gastronomic delicacy for the taking, one might think – but only those in approved waters are fit for consumption. It is also far from easy to prise wild Pacific oysters alive and intact from their tightly packed clusters in order to carry out the process of depuration – cleansing them of impurities. Unlike the declining native oyster – a round bivalve that lives beneath the tidal zone – this fast-growing mollusc thrives in brackish water and reproduces at extraordinary rates, with an individual capable of producing 200m eggs in a single spawning. It will be a challenge to slow their onward march, and eradication is now considered unfeasible. For this coastal empire-builder, the world is their oyster. And, strange as it may sound, these scruffy-looking trespassers flaunting themselves on the harbour walls in Plymouth look like they know it."
"In 2017, nearly two billion animals a year were loaded onto ships or lorries to be sent on journeys ranging from a few hours to six weeks and even more. Top of the list of animals being exported in absolute numbers are chickens. The amount of live chickens being moved around the world has ballooned by a staggering sixteen times in fifty years.  The numbers of other live farm animals (we collected data for pigs, cattle, sheep and goats) being exported has also grown dramatically over the past half a century, according to data from the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). This growth has shown no signs of slowing despite advances in refrigeration technology allowing fresh and frozen meat to be stored and transported and concerns around the spread of animal diseases such as African swine fever (ASF). The trade is driven by appetite from all over the world, but the Middle East is a particularly key region, and has been a major importer of sheep since records were first collected by the FAO in the 1960s. Alongside Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Jordan also imported 400,000 sheep in 2017. The US figures are mostly made up of pig imports from Canada and cattle imports from Mexico. Just off the bottom of this list, the UK imported 500,000 live farm animals in 2017, most of which were pigs from Ireland. We’ve left out the figures for imports of live chickens as the numbers are so large they would distort the chart. If we included the figures for chicken in the list of biggest exporters then the Netherlands would be top. But even taking away live chickens, the Netherlands is the second largest exporter of live pigs, cattle, sheep and goats after Denmark. The Danes are top mainly due to a large trade in pigs with Poland (6.2 million in 2017). Australia has been a major exporter of sheep and cattle since the FAO records started, but its export numbers have fallen from a high of close to 6.5 million in 2000. France has been exporting more than a million live cattle a year since the 1970s, according to FAO data. The majority of the animals it exported in 2017 went to Italy (980,000) and Spain (490,000), but it also sent 11,000 live cattle to Morocco, 14,000 to Lebanon and 38,000 to Algeria. Mali’s live cattle exports mostly went to Senegal (240,000) and Ivory Coast (200,000). The live sheep export market largely involves the animals heading to the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia (5.8 million), Kuwait (1.3 million), Qatar (590,000), Yemen (450,000), Jordan (400,000) and Oman (400,000) all major importers of sheep from Europe, Australia and Somalia. The other big sheep importers are Libya (1.2 million) and Italy (1 million). Most of the live pig exports from Denmark and the Netherlands are to other European countries. Along with the 6.2 million pigs the Danes sent to Poland, the Netherlands exported more than 8 million pigs to Germany in 2017. China’s 1.6 million pig exports all went to Hong Kong in 2017, although that trade has since been hit by the outbreak of ASF, a highly contagious viral pig disease, that has wiped out some 40% of the Chinese pig population. European countries dominate the live chicken export market, with the Netherlands and Germany alone responsible for the export of almost 700 million chickens in 2017. A large proportion of both countries’ exports of chickens are to each other. The Netherlands also exported 16 million chickens to the UK, 4 million to Thailand and 1 million each to Uganda and Russia in 2017. Most of the exports of live chickens from Belgium, the Czech Republic and Hungary are to other European countries."
"Puppy Maggie had been with the family for less than 24 hours when she began to show signs of sickness. Grace Piper from Worthing, West Sussex, had picked up the eight-week-old from a breeder in Brighton that advertised its puppies on pets4homes.co.uk for £750 each in cash. “She started being sick, she had diarrhoea, was lethargic, dehydrated and withdrawn,” Piper told the Guardian. “We called the vets [and] were told to feed her chicken and rice and hope for an improvement. All the time we were encouraging her to drink or eat something but all she wanted to do was sleep. We were increasingly worried.” Then Maggie collapsed on the floor. “At this point we knew something was seriously wrong with her. We called the vets again, and were told to bring her in and all of a sudden she stopped breathing. We gave CPR and mouth to mouth … The vets rushed her in to perform CPR, but after five minutes we were told that they had done everything they could, but that she wasn’t waking up.” Piper is one of a number of people who bought puppies online from the same location in Brighton. The Guardian has spoken to two people, both of whom paid large sums of money for the puppies before losing them to canine parvovirus, a highly contagious disease which causes acute gastrointestinal illness. The deaths come as the RSPCA says that complaints about illegal puppy farming have increased dramatically over the past 10 years and that 87% of current puppy trade calls are about animals purchased online. “The owners who sold us Maggie would have most likely seen symptoms before we got her but still sold [to] us anyway. The mother should have been vaccinated but clearly was not,” Piper said. “They were in a rush to get rid of her, and as soon as we left the door their phone was off, and we could no longer contact them.” Piper, who shared her dilemma on Facebook, heard from other owners who said they had also bought puppies from the same dealers. When she spoke to the RSPCA, they told her that their “inspector is going round to take those dogs out of the house as they are infected and should not be sold”. An RSPCA spokesperson told the Guardian that they were aware of the Brighton breeder in question but said: “Unfortunately, we can’t discuss complaints related to specific people or addresses and what action may have been taken.” “Sadly, we hear stories like this all too often. This is why we urge people to be extremely careful when buying puppies from breeders.” The RSPCA received 4,357 complaints in 2018 about the puppy trade in England, compared with 980 reports 10 years earlier in 2008. It marks an almost five-fold increase. East Sussex has seen a 127% increase in such reports in a decade. “Looking back after what’s happened to us,” said Piper, “it’s made us realise the house was strange. No toys and the kids weren’t allowed near the puppies. But we assumed then that the kids were kept away at the time for the viewing.” Isabel Winters, who lives in Brighton, bought the last of four labrador puppies advertised by the same breeder on Gumtree. It fell ill within a few days before dying in a veterinary hospital due parvovirus. “The whole thing is clearly a scam,” she said. “I bought it from Gumtree and thought it was with a pedigree breeder. I thought it was ok.” Winters’ purchase was a present for her son. “My son’s 14th birthday was coming up. He lost his father when he was nine, so this was a big thing for my son, to have a puppy. It was going to be a Christmas present and birthday present all rolled into one.” Winters said she wanted to visit the breeder’s location to check on the puppy’s mum and dad, but “they were very vague, they gave me a street name but not the number of the house”. Instead, they brought the puppy and the mother to her door. “It was all very sudden and quick. They arrived and they looked like a pair of charlatans.” Winters paid them £400 cash and arranged to pay the rest via online banking but her internet was down, so the dealers came in person for the money the next day. New government legislation is expected to come into force in England in April, banning the sale of puppy and kittens from third parties, meaning that owners will need to deal directly with breeders or rehoming centres. It is known as Lucy’s law after a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who died in a Welsh puppy farm due to constant forced pregnancies and dirty and cramped conditions. Illegal puppy farms work under the radar and avoid regulation or inspection, says Bill Lambert, senior health and welfare manager at the Kennel Club. “They are driven by profit and, as such, ignore animal welfare legislation or even basic welfare guidelines. Their breeding bitches will often be bred litter after litter, they will receive little human contact and will rarely be socialised,” he said. “Puppies are often kept in poor conditions where even basic, routine health measures such as health screening, immunisation or worming are applied. These puppies will often be taken away from their mothers far too early, transported away from where they are born and raised and sold to on to unsuspecting owners.” Increasing use of the internet to buy puppies has exacerbated the issue. Research by the Kennel Club last year found that about 30% of puppy buyers purchased their dogs from a puppy farm, a rise of 7% compared to 2018. “The growth of the internet has changed the buying habits of a lot of people and illegal puppy farmers will use advertising websites and social media to hide their true identity and use a website that makes them appear respectable and trustworthy when the reality may be completely different,” said Lambert Lambert said parvovirus attacks the intestines and immune systems of affected puppies and dogs, and can be deadly if left untreated. “It is highly infectious and is passed from puppy to puppy very quickly. Initial signs include a high temperature, having less energy and being off their food, with later symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea.” Daniella Dos Santos, the president of the British Veterinary Association, said: “Vets see first-hand the tragic consequences resulting from poorly-bred puppies, who are often taken away from their mothers at a very young age. They often suffer from disease, health problems and poor socialisation.” In November, the parliamentary environment, food and rural affairs committee wrote to the government expressing concerns about its commitments to stopping the illegal puppy smuggling trade. “The evidence we have heard so far has highlighted both the scale and the profitability of this cruel illegal trade,” said the committee’s chair, Neil Parish MP. Before buying puppies, Lambert said, buyers should make sure to see the puppy in its home environment, interacting with its mum, and also see paperwork such as vaccination records. He strongly advised against buying a puppy from a neutral location such as a motorway service station or a car park and said buyers should be wary of breeders who insist on purchase on the buyer’s first visit. Axel Lagercrantz, Pets4Homes’s CEO, said: “We were incredibly sad to hear the news of Maggie the labrador, and our thoughts are with Grace and her family. Our team of support staff works around the clock, seven days a week to monitor the website. Grace was of great help as she contacted our support staff when she realised something was wrong, and we were able to block the advert and the user from our platform promptly.” “For anyone considering adopting or rehoming a pet, we recommend consulting the advice section on our website, and the thorough checklist that we encourage every pet buyer to follow. ” A Gumtree spokesperson said: “We take the welfare of animals very seriously and work hard to ensure our site is a safe place to find pets in need of rehoming. We work hard to deter unscrupulous operators on the Gumtree platform through our compulsory paywall, and will delete any listings that we believe indicate signs of animal cruelty. “We encourage users to watch out for people selling popular breeds for cheap prices, to always check for medical records and to never purchase a pet before going to see it in person. If the conditions the animals are being kept in are suspicious, report the seller to the RSPCA and Gumtree immediately.”"
"Britain’s green economy has shrunk since 2014, heightening concerns that the government will miss targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the decade. The number of people employed in the “low carbon and renewable energy economy” declined by more than 11,000 to 235,900 between 2014 and 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Green businesses fared little better, seeing their numbers drop from an estimated 93,500 to 88,500 over the same four-year period. The ONS said there was a small increase in the number of people employed in the green economy between 2016 and 2018, but this was not enough to offset a huge drop in the number of jobs and businesses between 2014 and 2016. Critics of the Conservative government’s record of support for the low carbon and renewables sector blamed the Treasury’s dramatic cut in subsidies to the solar power industry for the sudden loss of employment. Solar panel installers were among the many businesses connected to the industry that went bust after the Treasury cut subsidy payments by 65% in 2015 before abolishing them altogether last year. Of the UK’s four countries, England saw the biggest fall in the number of green jobs followed by Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales was the only area to see an increase – from 10,000 to 11,400 jobs. Adding to the downbeat analysis, the ONS said the recent increase in activity was also mainly due to acquisitions in the renewable sector rather than an increase in investment. A report by the Committee on Climate Change, an independent government advisory body, found that UK emissions met the government’s 2018 target, following a decline in emissions to 44% below 1990 levels. But a recent slowdown meant it was “not on track” to meet the next target, which covers the period 2023-27, or to reduce emissions by at least 100% of 1990 levels by 2050. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial strategy said the figures for 2014 were distorted by a change in the way the ONS estimated employment and that since 2015 the number of green jobs had risen from 200,000 by more than 24,000. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said: “A greener economy creates enormous opportunities for new employment, with the low-carbon sector potentially supporting 2m green-collar jobs by 2030. “As we seek to end our contribution to climate change entirely by 2050, I am determined that these numbers will increase even further in the years ahead.” TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said recent progress was “still far too slow” and meant the government had a “dreadful record”. The Royal Society of Arts and Manufacturing said the figures “should be a wake-up call for ministers” who have pledged to cut greenhouse emissions to net zero by 2050. The thinktank’s director of economics, Asheem Singh, said: “It is pretty clear that the UK is well behind in meeting its next milestones and the 2050 target. “Reaching the target is inextricably linked to the growth of the green economy and it is clear from these figures that this just isn’t happening.” Britain’s renewable energy industry has expanded in the last three years, mainly in response to the growth of offshore windfarms. The share of total electricity generation from renewables reached 38.9% in September, the highest recorded and higher than gas generation for the first time. But the industry employs relatively few workers in service companies while most turbines are manufactured abroad, limiting the scope for a dramatic rise in the number of people employed across the industry. The ONS figures showed that £6.3bn worth of imports of renewables and low carbon services exceeded the value of exports by £1.2bn, leaving the UK with a 20% deficit in the balance of green trade. Caterina Brandmayr, senior policy analyst at Green Alliance said the figures “expose the yawning gap between the UK’s net zero law and policy in most government departments to drive decarbonisation”. She said most efforts to cut carbon had focused on the offshore wind sector, “but other sectors have huge untapped potential to decarbonise”. She added: “Efforts to cut carbon emissions from transport and buildings have been woefully unambitious. Transport emissions have flatlined since 1990 and buildings energy efficiency policy has been stalled for years. And there is very little policy at all to improve industry’s resource efficiency.” The Treasury is expected to put forward several measures to encourage investment in industries that promise to reduce carbon emissions, but investments are likely to take several years to bear fruit."
"The city has become a pedestrians and cyclists’ joy, especially for people like me who live in the city centre and have no car. As I type, they are busy turning our street into a low-traffic, communal woonerf or ‘living street’. It has become easier and safer to navigate the town on foot or by bike. Having recently returned from the Middle East the changes are even more striking, especially when it comes to my son. We were uncomfortable for him to cycle on the roads there but the ones here have been a fun and relatively stress-free experience. The changes have made an enormous difference to people’s quality of life. Khaled Diab, journalist and writer Yes it was drastic, but I believe there is no other way if we want liveable cities. Banning cars isn’t the end of the world. I sold mine and switched to electric car sharing. I worried about it but didn’t use it as much as I thought. In town I use the bicycle and it makes me happy. There are some negatives though. Public transport could be better at times and the city was cursed with negative communication: everyone thought the plan would be hell. So at the start people stayed away from the city, but things have now balanced out. Ine A city where you can hear people walking and talking mixed with the quiet zoom of bikes is such a vast improvement over the incessant noise of cars. One really has to drive along the Coupure  at rush hour to appreciate it in full. Thousands of people on their bikes on the busiest road and yet there is a certain calm to it. Businesses are flourishing and the city didn’t die like many naysayers predicted. The whole thing is awesome. If your city is planning to do the same my only advice is: don’t listen to the haters. Manu Joye, 41, IT manager The expanded area has made it much safer for cyclists. Complementary policies have been introduced like the cycle streets which have led people to cycle more. There are also fewer accidents and the city has become quieter to live in. My advice would be to focus on the whole city not just a small area to not disadvantage people who are not able to afford to live in privileged areas. Ghent has established several cycle streets where cars can’t overtake bikes. This, for me, is a very powerful addition to just having restricted areas for cars. Moritz Gallei, 26, university research assistant It has transformed the grey (but even then exciting town) where I came to study 38 years ago into the lively and diverse city it is now. Living just out of the centre and in the area where cars are still allowed there are positive consequences. As the plan contains a reduction of ‘gates’ you have to use to get to the parking spaces (many of which are in the centre as they were built before the plan was conceived) the through traffic is managed better. Koen De Maeseneir, 56, manager of the federation of community health centres in the city I have a safer feeling as a cyclist compared to the time before the circulatieplan. The border of each area is now demarcated by ‘knips’. At these points cyclists and pedestrians are king. It’s a big misunderstanding that the city is not accessible anymore – we only got rid of traffic that doesn’t need to be there. If you want to go from point A to B by car, you use the ring [road] and don’t go through the medieval city centre. That’s logical, isn’t it? If you’re thinking of doing the same, don’t be afraid of change. Stijn It’s funny to hear people say how it was impossible to get around Ghent and that they couldn’t use their car. For me, living in Leuven, a town with a similar circulation plan, it sounded like people were talking about visiting a war zone. My brother and his family live in Ghent and they got rid of their car because it became obsolete. What stands out most is the silence. Gone was the typical noise of cars. The air also tastes better than in the small towns where traffic is denser than in the city. And then you have the wonderful experiments of ‘living streets’, where people turn their streets into sitting rooms and extra gardens. Without cars there is so much more space in a city. Tine Hens, journalist, Leuven Before the plan, big parts of the city used to be gridlocked for several hours each day. Although there was already an extensive pedestrian area, many lovely streets were spoiled by queueing cars. Now the city centre is fun to hang around in all day through. The number of cyclists is increasing impressively. Pedestrians are having a good time and most shopkeepers are doing great business. Most people are taking the change for the better for granted already. Lieven Van de Woestyne, 54, teacher I’m pro circulatieplan and really glad the city introduced it. The city is much more enjoyable than before. Some busy streets were just used as a passing-through by cars, by people who don’t live in the city and who don’t really need to be there. This caused a lot of unnecessary traffic. The city is still perfectly reachable for cars. There was so much negative publicity before its introduction that visitors now think they cannot visit Ghent by car anymore, which is not true. In fact, the car-free zones are just a very small part of the city. My only hope is that they continue to expand it to smaller districts outside the city centre of Ghent (eg Muide, Brugse Poort, Bloemekenswijk). If you’re thinking about doing the same, just go for it! Jolien The inner city is a dream to walk and cycle in since there are barely any cars except for some taxis. Most of the cars that do drive in the inner city also drive a lot slower than they used to. Personally I feel like the streets are more alive as they aren’t just for cars anymore. More people put their chairs out in the summer to sit on the pavement and talk, and some streets become ‘living streets’ where the kids can play outside, skate, and adults hold barbecues. Eline"
"It is a crisp winter morning and the area around Notre Dame is sealed off as it has been since the fire last April that devastated the cathedral. Those in the know, however, especially those with the keenest of eyes, might spot some small movement high up to the south of the stricken and blackened structure. The bees of Notre Dame, whose escape from the inferno seemed almost miraculous, are thriving and conserving their energy ready to produce honey this summer, just as they have every year since they took up residence on the sacristy roof in 2013. Nearly 10 months after the Paris cathedral was ravaged by fire, the three colonies are healthier than ever, according to their beekeeper. Sibyle Moulin, who looks after the hives, spoke to the Guardian after she visited them for the first time in six months. Access to the site is restricted because the severely damaged 13th-century stone structure is still unstable and there is a risk from lead particles from the roof that was turned into dust in the blaze. Moulin, who had to undergo a health and safety course to resume visits to the honey bees, said the 30-45,000 insects in the three hives are absolutely fine. “There’s nothing wrong with them at all. The behaviour of the colonies is perfectly normal,” she said. “They’re not very active at this time of the year, but that’s how it should be. They seem fine.” When fire tore through the cathedral last year, most people feared the bees, which can number up to 50,000 per colony, had perished. Moulin’s company, Beeopic, received calls of support from well-wishers all over the world, who were moved by reports that the bees had not abandoned their queens in the face of danger, but had gorged on honey and hunkered down to protect their colonies. Although untouched by the flames which destroyed the cathedral’s famous roof structure, Moulin says she was initially worried the heat might have damaged the hives, given their position on the sacristy roof on the south side of the cathedral and approximately 30m (98ft) below the main roof. Another concern was that firefighters, whose priority was to control the fire, might have disturbed them in their frantic efforts to put out the blaze. “Of course, my first thought was for the cathedral itself. My second was for the bees. I kept watching the television footage of the fire but the captions at the bottom always hid the sacristy roof, which is below the main roof, so I couldn’t see if they’d been touched,” Moulin said. Drone footage in the aftermath of the fire showed the hives were intact, but it took several weeks of detective work to establish if the colonies had survived the proximity to temperatures estimated to have reached 800C(1,470F) at their peak. “An ounce of hope. The three hives are still in place … and visibly intact,” Nicolas Géant, head of Beeopic, tweeted hours after the fire was put out. “As for the occupants … the mystery remains. All that smoke, heat, water. “We will have to see if our brave bees are still with us as soon as we’re given access to the site, which may take some time,” he added. Two days later, Géant announced: “Our bees at the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral are still alive.” Moulin says beekeepers had to piece together clues in film footage taken of the cathedral. “We examined satellite images and we saw the hives were intact and hadn’t been knocked over and there were no puddles of wax underneath them. As the wax melts at around 70C we knew they hadn’t been affected by the heat. We weren’t worried about the smoke, because we use it to sedate them so we knew they’d just go to sleep around the queen. “Then we were sent some film from some of the people working on securing the cathedral and we could see bees going in and out of the hives. We studied their behaviour and saw they were carrying balls of pollen on their feet which meant they were building up stocks of protein to feed the young. “As soon as we knew there were baby bees we knew it meant the queens were fine since they were producing them.” It was good news, but Moulin could not be 100% sure of the health of the colonies until she was given permission to visit the devastated cathedral in July, three months after the fire. “They didn’t seem to have been affected at all. Of course, there’s lots of noxious material all around them, including the lead dust, but they’re not like children; they won’t be licking walls or touching anything other than flowers. The only thing they might come into direct contact with that might be contaminated is the water they drink.” In July, Moulin retrieved 66kg of honey from the three hives, samples from which have been sent to laboratories in Canada to be tested for lead. Beeopic maintains the hives and bee colonies, but the honey produced from those on the roof of Notre Dame, and the 350 other hives in Paris that the company looks after – of a total of 700 dotted around the city – belongs to the owners of the buildings on whose roofs they sit, including that of Louis Vuitton on the Champs Elysées and the nearby Grand Palais on the north bank of the Seine. The urban honey bees, of the Brother Adam Buckfast variety, were developed for their mild temperament in the 1920s by a Benedictine monk. The Notre Dame hives were installed on the cathedral roof in 2013 as a gesture to promote biodiversity. There are also hives managed by other companies on the Paris Opera buildings, the Comédie Française, Coca-Cola’s French headquarters and several banks. Moulin, who normally visits each hive at least once a month, hopes to remove the queens from the three Notre Dame hives this summer and replace them with younger royals. The queen bees can live for five years, while their worker bees have a lifespan of around 45 days. “We usually do this every year because when the queen bee is older there is a tendency for the colony to swarm, which tends to frighten people in the city, so we try to avoid it. The problem is that anything leaving the site has to be washed down and decontaminated, and I can’t see myself putting the bees into the shower,” she said. “At first the authorities wanted us to remove the hives, but they’ve seen [the cathedral through the catastrophe and they’re still there, so it seemed more intelligent to leave them alone.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"A fracking protester’s sentence has been reduced by the court of appeal, which said greater leniency should be shown in convictions for non-violent civil disobedience. Katrina Lawrie, 41, was found guilty of contempt of court in June last year for breaching an injunction that banned trespassers blocking access to the energy firm Cuadrilla’s site on Preston New Road in Lancashire. On Thursday, Lawrie’s suspended prison sentence was reduced from two months to four weeks, after the court ruled her human rights were not taken fully into account by a judge. Passing the ruling, Lord Justice Leggatt said greater clemency should be given in response to acts of civil disobedience than in dealing with other acts of unlawful disobedience. “A person who engages in acts of civil disobedience establishes a moral difference between herself and ordinary law-breakers which it is right to take into account in determining what punishment is deserved,” he added. “The fact that such a protester is generally – apart from their protest activity – a law-abiding citizen, there is reason to expect that less severe punishment is necessary to deter such a person from further law-breaking.” Lawrie, who had camped at the Little Plumpton site near Blackpool for two years, was sentenced in September after taking part in a “lock-on” protest in July 2018. Her fellow protesters Chris Wilson and Lee Walsh were both given a four-week suspended sentence. Lawrie was given a longer sentence because she had also stood in front of a delivery lorry on two separate occasions. However, the court of appeal ruled that despite her “complete lack of contrition”, Lawrie’s imprisonment was not justified and the appropriate penalty should be the same as for the contempt committed by the other campaigners. Lord Justice Underhill, also presiding over the hearing, said: “The court attach great weight to the right of peaceful protest, even where this causes disruption to others.” The campaigners had applied to have key parts of the injunction obtained by Cuadrilla – which also prohibited protesters from “conspiring to interfere with the supply chain” by preventing trucks from entering the site – removed. However, in December, the company itself applied to withdraw those parts of the injunction. The court also granted permission for the protesters to appeal against the finding in the original case that they should pay Cuadrilla’s legal fees – which could be in the region of £70,000. They will argue at a hearing in the coming weeks that the ruling breaches their human right to a fair trial and access to the courts. A further argument that Lawrie, Walsh and Wilson should not have been convicted because an anti-protest injunction imposed on the site was too vague was rejected by the court. Cuadrilla was forced to stop work at the site in November, weeks before the licence was due to expire, after a scientific study warned it was not possible to rule out “unacceptable” consequences for those living near fracking sites."
"The Wilderness Society has launched legal action challenging the environmental approval granted to Norwegian energy giant Equinor to explore for oil in the Great Australian Bight. The conservation group had flagged a possible court case after the proposal to deepwater drill in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park was approved by the federal offshore petroleum regulator in December. It was the second, and most significant, of four regulatory hurdles Equinor needs to clear before it can drill. Peter Owen, the Wilderness Society’s South Australian director, said Equinor had refused to formally consult affected groups as required. He said the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, known as Nopsema, had made a legal error in accepting the company’s claims that it had. Owen said the decision effectively dismissed the concerns of environment groups representing tens of thousands of members, Indigenous custodians with cultural values threatened by offshore drilling and more than 20 local governments responsible for communities and coastal property as not relevant to the approval process. “We should all be very concerned about the precedent Equinor and Nopsema have set here,” he said. “We have no doubt that if Equinor had fully and legally consulted with these parties, its plans would have been better informed and more robust. Instead, it is our view that it now holds an invalid approval.” Equinor declined to respond, saying it was not appropriate to comment on a matter before a court. The company has previously said its plan shows drilling can be done safely and it had been preparing its proposal for two and a half years, including more than 400 meetings with community and other organisations. It was granted a petroleum title over areas in the bight in 2011. The proposed Stromlo-1 well site is in water more than 2.2km deep and nearly 400km off the South Australian coast. Nopsema said it had approved the plan after a rigorous assessment that took almost eight months. Equinor still needs a well operations plan and a facility safety case approved before it can begin drilling. The regulator said it had imposed stringent conditions on its approval, including limits on the time of year activity can take place and regular public reporting on environmental impact, to ensure a high level of protection that reflected the bight’s uniqueness. It had earlier asked Equinor to modify and resubmit its environmental plan to provide more information on its consultation with affected groups and on the risks posed by oil spills. An analysis based on an amalgamation of 100 oil spill simulations found there was potential for a spill to spread along the coastline and into the ocean between Esperance in Western Australia, Sydney and Tasmania. Equinor’s plans have sparked protests that organisers say have been supported by tens of thousands of people across Australia. Owen said polling suggested a majority of Australians opposed the project. The conservation group’s federal court action is supported by Indigenous elders and Holdfast Bay council. Bunna Lawrie, an elder of the Mirning people, the traditional owners of the bight, said he feared drilling would lead to oil spills that poisoned the sea and affect whales. The council’s mayor, Amanda Wilson, said it was disappointed Nopsema had not considered its concerns about the potential economic and environmental impact of an oil spill, particularly on Glenelg. “Our 11km of pristine white sandy beaches in Holdfast Bay are a major drawcard for visitors and our local community, and it’s our duty to protect them,” she said. If approved, Equinor plans to begin work late this year, with the operations expected to last between 30 and 60 days."
"Forget cruises. The super-rich have found a new way to see the world in the luxurious style of an ocean liner but taking a fraction of the time: private jet round-the-world tours. This week, 50 members of the wealthy elite will board a privately chartered Boeing 757 to begin a 24-day guided tour of the globe, taking in Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, the Galápagos islands and mountain gorillas in Rwanda. The trip involves 10 flights, 23 nights in five-star hotels or lodges, meals in some of the world’s most famous restaurants, champagne and “every single tip”. Thrown in are tour guides, an engineer, seven cabin crew, a chef and an “expedition physician”. The cost is £108,000 a person for couples, or £118,800 for one. The cost to the environment is the emission of 13 tonnes of carbon dioxide per passenger, according to research for the Observer by analysts at the clean transport campaign group Transport and Environment. It would take a typical family of four driving to their annual holiday on the south coast of France more than 30 years to rack up the same emissions. Going by train, they could make the same trip 150 times before reaching the same level of emissions. The jet used for the trip, which is described by the organiser, TCS World Travel, as “the Ferrari of commercial jets”, has been designed for well-heeled clients. The plane, which can carry up to 295 passengers, has been reconfigured to accommodate 50 customers in business class seats. The carbon footprint will be almost six times more per person than if the plane was filled with economy class travellers. TCS said it had paid to offset all flights. If you are thinking of joining the tour, you’re too late. The trip sold out months in advance. When the trip is completed, it’s a quick turn around before a fresh set of wealthy passengers begins another round-the-world adventure. The next 25-day trip includes Machu Picchu, Easter Island, the Great Barrier Reef, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and a safari in the Serengeti. It starts in late February and has also sold out. At least three other companies, including the luxury hotel chain Four Seasons and the Singaporean hotel chain Aman, offer similar trips. Four Seasons’ trips include an onboard chef. “It’s the highest Four Seasons restaurant in the world,” says Kerry Sear, Four Seasons’ executive chef, in the marketing video. “I often hear, ‘how are you going to wow us on this trip, Kerry?’. “The social area [on the plane] is really exciting for me as the chef. Every hour there will be something to snack on, it could be something from the location we left, or something highlighting the location we are going to. You are going to have people who expect a three-star Michelin experience, but then you’ve got somebody who really wants a peanut butter jelly sandwich.” Shelley Cline, the president of TCS, said the company had commissioned a dedicated private jet from Airbus to replace the Boeing 757 next year, with 52 Italian leather fully-flat beds. Cline said many of the travellers were entrepreneurs who had made millions from their own businesses. “Many are self-made and want to enjoy themselves after all that hard work, but no matter their age or how they make their living, they are all curious about the world,” she said. “Time-saving is absolutely one of the big selling points about our trips. We fly direct, which also eliminates the hassles of airport layovers. We did a calculation, and to do the same around the world trip on commercial air would take 10 more days (34 vs 24) and would entail 11 more flights, 39 more hours of flying time and about 74 more hours waiting between flights. “Another reason people take our trips is for the special experiences and access that would be prohibitive to do on their own. Whether it’s getting into the Hermitage before it opens to the general public, having an amazing private dinner at a temple at Angkor Wat, or having dinner with royalty in some countries, we are able to provide our guests experiences that last a lifetime.” Cline said TCS prided itself on thinking of everything a traveller might need, extending to all but writing postcards to families and friends for them. “They don’t have to handle their luggage, we fill out their immigration forms (well, they do have to sign them),” she said. “We even provide stamped postcards and spending money in the local currency at every stop.” Guests are accompanied by experts who give lectures on destination stops, including David Keeling, a professor of geography at Western Kentucky University. “As a cultural geographer I focus on destination context, such as demographics, economics, geopolitics, history and resource management,” he said. “Most of my lectures have an environmental component. For example, we are visiting the Maldives and my lecture for that destination covers the impacts of climate change, geopolitical implications for small island communities, and economic challenges. I talk a lot about carbon footprints and carbon offsetting, something that TCS is very sensitive about, and the company provides opportunities for guests to offset their footprint.” Jack Ezon, founder and managing partner of luxury travel agency Embark Beyond, said organised round-the-world private jet holidays started booming in popularity about four years ago. “They really give people the opportunity to explore the world in the limited time they have,” he said. “You’re not going to be able to deep dive into Cambodia in a single day, but it enables you to stitch together a story from around the world. By looking at how quickly it’s proliferating, there are clearly enough people with enough money for this.” Ezon said most guests were baby boomers. “It is usually the cruise client who has done every port of call, and is looking for new experiences. They’re not just any old trip. They make it an experience, they do dinners in palaces or parties on the Great Wall of China. They really go beyond what you expect, and to places that ordinary clients travelling on their own wouldn’t be able to go to.”"
"The cumaru trees could have been planted elsewhere in this Amazon reserve, where they had better chances of flourishing. Instead, they were planted in harsh, sandy soil in the dry savannah that breaks up the forest. Jack beans, guandu peas and other crops were planted in straw around them with cut savannah grass, for moisture and compost. “We call it the cradle,” says agronomist Alailson Rêgo. “It protects them.” The hope is that if these Amazon-native trees – whose seeds can be used in cosmetics – thrive on this sandy soil and a nearby patch of deforested, burned land, they can regenerate abandoned pasture elsewhere. In the Amazon, more land is cleared for cattle than anything else. It’s easier enough to clear – chop down a few trees, light a few fires. But restoring the forest? Bringing back the life and the greenness? That is far, far harder. Located in the secluded Amazon reserve of Tapajós-Arapiuns in Brazil’s Pará state, the Experimental Active Forest Centre (CEFA) was set up in 2016 to solve problems like this. It is a research and development centre where farming within the forest, or agroforestry, rather than clearing it for cattle or soya, is the focus. And it is part of a growing movement for sustainable agriculture in Brazil that has taken on a new urgency with the coronavirus pandemic, as scientists warn that the climate crisis and land development heighten the chances of another deadly virus jumping from animals to humans. “It is a way of dealing with nature that is playing with the apocalypse,” says Eugenio Scannavino Netto, the doctor and infectious diseases specialist who helped set up the centre. “We are heading for collective suicide.” Now 61, Scannavino Netto has spent three decades in the rainforest working on Amazon solutions. In 1987, he founded the non-profit Health and Happiness Project, known by its Portuguese initials PSA (Projeto Saúde e Alegria), in nearby Alter do Chão. The group helps sustainable community development while providing health and education services for remote communities using a hospital boat and clowns. Last year it was judged one of the 100 best NGOs in Brazil. The centre’s aims are ambitious, but equally practical: 40,000 seedlings from its nursery will be donated to local communities to reforest areas in the reserve cut down and burned for cattle or traditional farming. These include pau-brasil, grown to be sold as wood; urucum, whose seeds are traditionally used as a body paint by the Amazon’s indigenous peoples and sold for colourant in lipstick; and pau-rosa, whose leaves are used in perfume. “The culture here is slash and burn, and we’re trying to change that,” Scannavino Netto says. A collection of beehives houses stingless bees. Smallholder Joelma Lopes, 46, from the nearby community of Carão, learned beekeeping here and now subsidises her income by selling honey from her own bees. “It was a door that opened to a lot of knowledge,” she says. Moacir Imbiriba, 40, a Kumaruara indigenous man who works at the centre, says children in his village now use agroforestry techniques in their vegetable garden. “Many leaders consider this an evolution for the communities,” he says. But while the PSA’s projects in this region have been widely praised for benefits such as reducing infant mortality, police raided its headquarters in Alter do Chão last November. Officers arrested four firefighters from a volunteer brigade who tackled blazes in local reserves during last year’s Amazon fires – one of whom worked for the NGO. Documents and computers were seized. The police inquiry has alleged that the firefighters were setting the fires in reserves near Alter do Chão – a beauty spot with popular beaches – to get international money. Serious failings in the inquiry’s work were exposed by Brazilian media. Federal prosecutors investigating land grabbers suspected of setting fires in the same reserve said they had found no evidence of volunteer firefighters or NGOs being involved. The inquiry, suspended during the pandemic, is yet to conclude. But the police raid came weeks after Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, accused NGOs of setting Amazon fires without providing any evidence. “This is much more a political operation than a technical, police operation,” says Scannavino Netto. In fact, the PSA aims to be inclusive rather than politically divisive. Last year it organised a sustainable agriculture event in the nearest city of Santarém. The idea, says Caetano Scannavino, Scannavino Netto’s brother and the PSA’s coordinator, was simple. He says: “How can we produce an agenda that unites the environmental movement, the indigenous movement and the agribusiness sector?” Rogério Vian, a farmer from Goiás state, who farms organic and sustainable soya, spoke at the event. He is one of a nationwide group of farmers working on sustainable farming techniques and reducing pesticide use – what he calls a middle way between full organic and conventional farming. “Farmers need the forest and environment more than anyone else,” he says. “Why not produce and conserve? You can do it all at the same time.” Another speaker was Ernst Götsch, 72, a Swiss farmer who developed a system of growing crops and trees together he calls “syntropic” agriculture on a farm in Bahia in north-east Brazil. “We have 50-60 different species of trees and palm trees per hectare. It’s very diverse. I don’t use any fertiliser, I don’t use any pesticides,” he says. Agroforestry techniques like this were used by indigenous communities before Spanish and Portuguese explorers arrived. “They had similar strategies,” says Götsch.  Now the coronavirus pandemic has given farmers more reasons to change. As the Netflix series Pandemic revealed, scientists and researchers have found thousands of other zoonotic diseases like the new coronavirus and fear that another virus could jump to human beings, like avian and swine flu  or Mers. Deforestation has already been blamed for the 1999 Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia that killed 105 people after it jumped from bats to pigs and then people. The outbreak inspired the 2011 movie Contagion, starring Gwyneth Paltrow. In March, Scannavino Netto argued in Brazil’s Folha de S.Paulo newspaper that the monocultures of modern agriculture were destroying everything from biodiversity to insects that serve as “bioregulators”. Cutting down the Amazon changes animal behaviour and heightens the risk of another, much more lethal virus jumping to humans. Covid-19 has been a warning. “Either we change,” he said in a recent phone interview, “or we will die in the next pandemic. And it will be fast.”"
"Inside the white trailer parked up by the farm, the small team headed by Matthias Kürten are moving fast. Their work has a rhythmical soundtrack: a bandsaw cutting through bones, fat slopped into buckets, murmurs of chatter and knives being sharpened. Diced meat for stew, steaks, soup stock, mince and liver are sealed with the inhale of a vacuum-packer, stamped by a sticker machine, and land in plastic crates with a thud. Ten days earlier Kürten had come to the farm and slaughtered seven cows and calves; the carcasses are hanging in a nearby cooling wagon. Now his team are back to process the meat. Kürten, a softly spoken man with a ready laugh, is Germany’s only mobile butcher: a one-stop shop for livestock slaughter and meat processing.In Germany, slaughterhouses – as they are in the US and elsewhere in Europe – are increasingly being seen as coronavirus hotspots, as hundreds of workers have tested positive across the country in recent weeks. A plant in Dissen, Lower Saxony, is the latest to close after 92 workers tested positive. The cases have thrown the industry into the spotlight – particularly the close working and living conditions for employees. The federal government will this week discuss stricter measures to reduce the spread of the virus. But so far the coronavirus hasn’t impacted Kürten’s business. “We actually have more work,” he says. “Our customers are buying more.” Partly he thinks people want to stock up and buy more to distribute among friends to help them out. Cleaning products have been harder to get hold of, but being a smaller operation means it’s easier to maintain safe distancing.Founded in 2002, Kürten’s butcher is a curious anomaly in an industry characterised by ever greater economies of scale. Around the world slaughterhouses are getting fewer and bigger. “We are doing the exact opposite,” Kürten reflects, a saw wedged in a swaying carcass at his side. “And it’s working really well.” Over the course of a year he visits roughly 350 farms, usually slaughtering one to four cows, two or three pigs and as many as 38 sheep on each, and butchering them to the farmers’ specifications – often, as is the case today, with their help. At the heart of his business lies the conviction that animals should be slaughtered on the farm. “This means they are calm,” he says. “They can eat up until the last moment. Mostly they don’t understand what is happening at all.” This is why farmers such as Andrea Schmitz, who has been a client for a decade, chooses Kürten over the cheaper alternative of an industrial slaughterhouse. “The animals are born here in the barn with us and run around our fields … They aren’t driving off in a truck,” she says. Francesca Porta of the advocacy organisation Eurogroup for Animals adds: “It solves the problem of the stress of loading into a truck, the long journey to a slaughterhouse, and the unloading where the animal doesn’t know where it is and then has to wait [for slaughter].” Earlier this year the Guardian reported that as the live animal export trade booms across Europe, animals are travelling ever-longer distances, while the European Commission is failing to fully implement its own transport welfare regulations. Longer journeys are linked to a trend across Europe for fewer and larger slaughterhouses, run by an increasingly small number of large commercial players. “In Germany we have a very strong concentration in the slaughtering industry,” says Katrin Wenz, from Friends of the Earth Germany. A few smaller slaughterhouses can still be found in states such as Lower Saxony, she adds, but in places like Brandenburg companies have to transport animals over long distances. More than half the pigs in Germany, for example, are slaughtered by just three companies. “It became increasingly hard for smaller companies to compete,” says Wenz, citing low profit margins and high EU requirements. “More and more gave up because the big industrial slaughterhouses could slaughter increasingly cheaply and efficiently.” Kürten is not slaughtering any animals today, but when he does the farmer is usually present. His methods differ depending on the animal: a bolt gun for cattle, electric stunning for pigs and sheep. He remembers the butcher visiting his family farm when he was younger, and the village shops that slaughtered animals themselves rather than have meat delivered. Since starting his training at 16, he has witnessed the industry reconfigure: “I worked [back then] in a small shop – but these aren’t around any more.” He believes, like many others, that the key turning point was the EU hygiene regulations that came into force in 2006. Kürten was able to find enough investment to ensure his business could comply with the new standards but many, he recalls, gave up. And while he still feels the pressure of high costs – including machinery and vets to oversee slaughter – Kürten says the business keeps growing. He’s booked up months ahead. Kürten points to the Natur Fleisch (natural meat) stickers on the packages. It describes, he says, the personal relationships between the customer, farm and butcher, and that the product comes from animals “that in the summer are able to stand in the field”. “An email is sent out saying a cow has been slaughtered and five hours later everything will be sold,” he says. “And this is sent locally, among a circle of friends and acquaintances – not throughout Germany.” Nothing, he’s happy to say, ends up in the supermarket. In recent years the German slaughterhouse industry has been criticised for low pay and poor working conditions, particularly for the thousands of eastern European migrant workers it employs. “One of the biggest challenges for the slaughter industry today, as it will be in the next 10–15 years, is finding enough staff,” says Thomas Bernhard, from the German Union of Food and Catering. In a series of interviews with German slaughterhouse workers, sociologist Marcel Sebastian at the Europa-Universität Flensburg, documented how they perceived the cultural shift from honest craft to source of moral stigma. “They struggled with this dramatic shift in public perception,” says Sebastian. While many see him as a curious niche, Kürten remains optimistic. Dozens of red crates are filling up in preparation for tomorrow’s customers – a startling amount from a few animals. Kürten finds particular satisfaction in wasting as little as possible. Shiva, his portly dog, follows him as he works, eagerly awaiting scraps. Kürten works six days a week, and it will be dusk before he attaches the trailer to his car and drives home to his second rottweiler, Achilles. Is he concerned about more people rejecting meat altogether in the future? “No, not at all,” he says. “If we were only producing half – or a third – [of the meat] we do now then we would be doing it right. We already have too much. A little bit less would be good.”"
" Just a few minutes from Richmond station, the River Thames flows past a parade of royal palaces, stately homes and well-groomed parks. Known as the Arcadian Thames, or London’s countryside, this is where the capital begins to transform into the wilderness beyond it. But this is a wilderness that has been tamed and controlled over time, much like the rest of the river. To help boats moving along it and to protect riverside communities from flooding, much of the Thames has been straightened and canalised – the natural flood plain either side has been built over and water has been penned in with flood defences. The dangers of building on flood plains have been exposed more than ever in recent weeks, as a series of storms left hundreds of homes and businesses deluged by water across the UK. The Guardian has revealed that more than 11,000 homes in England will be built on land with a high risk of flooding in the coming years and in some of the areas most affected by the recent floods, up to one in five homes built between 2015-2018 were built in flood zones. As a result, only 10% of flood plains in England are now fit for purpose, as infrastructure has hindered their ability to store water and act as a natural sponge to soak up deluges. With the climate crisis set to bring more heavy rains and rising sea levels, the river along the Arcadian stretch in Richmond is just one of many waterways increasingly breaching its restraints and flooding open areas that fall within its natural flood plain. “It’s pretty much underwater and that is going to be the new norm. The river is telling us that it wants that flood plain back,” says Jason Debney, the coordinator of the Thames Landscape Strategy (TLS), a partnership of 15 organisations and more than 200 community groups leading a multi-million pound project to restore and rewild the Arcadian flood plain. Despite flood plain land making up 12% of England’s landscape, the Environment Agency says most people have no “general awareness” of of their existence.  “People are so disconnected from their natural flood plains now that they might not understand what we’re trying to do here. They could see it as a loss of open space and the beetle-huggers taking over somewhere where kids can kick a football around,” says Debney. That’s why effective communication and education is an integral part of the rewilding project, which was launched by Sir David Attenborough last year. If the flood plain is not made more effective soon, these areas will end up underwater anyway, Debney says, so it is crucial to develop them now so they can host water and people simultaneously. Historically the Thames has been controlled by building flood defences such as the Thames Barrier, often in response to specific events such as the 1953 North Sea flood that claimed hundreds of lives. But a report says London has become the most vulnerable city in western Europe to floods as a result of climate breakdown, meaning this method is no longer sustainable, unless residents are happy to see huge walls built along their riverbanks. Debney says: “You can either have that flood defence and be completely disconnected from the river, or you can have a rewilding process, and keep the character of the river.” Healthy flood plains also bring other benefits, as they are a natural habitat for many species and act as a carbon sink. While a huge flood plain areawould need to be created to completely solve the problem of the rising Thames, Debney says this is an effective first step in stemming the tide. The Arcadia area is at particular risk of flooding as it is the meeting point for seawater flowing upstream and fresh water coming downstream. Changing weather patterns and rising sea levels are increasing the risk of tidal surges, while the paving over of green spaces and increased frequency of heavy storms is directing rainwater straight into the river and increasing flow by as much as 40%. In Richmond’s Old Deer Park, one of six sites chosen for the rewilding project, an expanse of grass is regularly flooded, rendering it unusable. Debney says the plan would transform this barren area into “one of the most diverse, wet ecosystems anywhere in the country”. The TLS plans to create a network of creeks, wetlands, bogs, reedbeds and fen, a mosaic of wet habitats that could sustain more wildlife and better hold excess river water, with a raised footpath giving public access. Other sites include Desborough Island in Surrey and the Canbury Gardens urban park in Kingston upon Thames. The London charity Thames21 also works to rewild the capital’s waterways. It says 30km (18 miles) has already been rewilded, but there is scope for at least three times this amount to be restored if the practice is embedded in future planning. Flood plain rewilding projects have long been present in rural areas to try to combat flood risks. In Leicestershire, the Wildlife Trust is working to restore the plains along the River Soar used as agricultural land. “Rewilding helps the flood plain to keep water for longer and makes a big difference downstream in Leicester, where we’ve seen lots of flash floods recently,” says Ben Devine, a conservation officer at Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. “The conventional understanding of flood defences is of a big wall, but we know that collectively these natural flood management [rewilding] interventions work and now we’re scientifically trying to prove it so they can become part of a broader flood management approach,” he added. Their work involves preventing any more building on the plain, reconnecting wetland habitats and allowing areas to become wilder. Similar work is being carried out on the Upper Aire to tackle flooding in Leeds, which has been hit by the recent storms. An Environment Agency spokesperson said the need for strong flood plains is more vital than ever: “ Global overheating is changing our weather and increasing our risks of flooding. Over 5 million people in England are at risk from flooding and coastal erosion, yet only a third of people who live in areas at risk of flooding believe their property is at risk.” Debney warns the Arcadian Thames can breach its banks and overwhelm those nearby in a matter of minutes – a lifeboat is frequently called out to rescue walkers trapped on flooded benches. “Doing nothing is not an option any more. We have to respond in some way. And this is about adapting to climate change.”"
"In 2014, Giles Nicholson was battling the growing year from hell. A mild winter followed by a warm, wet spring had turbocharged a ferocious mass of cow parsley, nettles and dense grass along the hundreds of miles of road his team maintains for Dorset council. Austerity meant there was barely enough money to pay for repeated cuttings to hold back the matted swards. Complaints poured in about messy roadsides. “[The machinery] wouldn’t go through it,” says Nicholson, recalling the overspilling verges. But the chaos of that summer would prove an unlikely turning point for wildflowers and biodiversity in the English county. Vast stretches of roadside have been transformed. Where there were thick clumps of grass, there are low-growing wildflowers such as black medic, birds-foot trefoil and red clover. The verges are cut two or three times a year, not 12, saving the council tens of thousands of pounds. Butterflies and other invertebrates have returned in their droves. The reasons behind this unlikely mini-revolution for biodiversity are simple. When the worst of the 2014 growing season was over, ecologist Philip Sterling was brought in to oversee the council’s service team. He and Nicholson, Dorset council’s countryside and greenspace manager, set about applying the centuries-old principles of hay making to the management of verges, cul-de-sacs and urban grass patches across the county. It is a practice that has now been adopted by other counties in the UK, including in Lincolnshire. The process is simple: cut infrequently, ideally, just twice a year in spring and then late summer once plants have bloomed and seeded; remove the clippings to gradually reduce the fertility of the soil and prevent a buildup of mulch; repeat, wait, and enjoy the resurgent wildlife and flowers. “It will not fail,” says Sterling, who, as programme manager for charity Butterfly Conservation’s building sites for butterflies project, has taken his roadside revolution around the country to any local authority that will listen. “As fertility declines in a soil, biodiversity increases. At first that seems a little counterintuitive because you imagine the more you pour into a soil, the more plants that can grow. That’s not how it works in the natural system. In more fertile systems, a few species dominate and they swamp and smother everything else.” Grass cuttings are almost always left where they fall along the thousands of miles of road verges that are maintained by law in the UK. Over time, the resulting mulch increases the fertility of the soil, meaning the grass grows with increasing vigour and needs to be cut more frequently. The cut and collect method breaks the cycle. The before and after photos of otherwise ordinary roadsides across Dorset show the dramatic effects of Nicholson and Sterling’s maintenance regime, as suffocated seed banks have been allowed to spring back into life. Yarrow and yellow flashes of lady’s bedstraw punctuate roadsides and roundabouts throughout summer. Magenta pyramidal orchids linger outside a branch of Tesco. The cost savings of managing roadsides this way are equally stunning for the council’s accounting department. The annual budget for highway verge management dropped from nearly £1m to £650k in five years under the cut and collect, low fertility approach. London boroughs, councils from across the country and European governments are paying attention. “For the last 40 years we’ve been doing entirely the wrong thing,” says Sterling, impatient with the possibilities for roadsides across the UK and beyond. Wildflower meadows, ancient British ecosystems that are crucial for wildlife, thrived for centuries with the help of traditional farming methods and livestock husbandry, but have largely vanished in the post-war era. Industrialised use of nitrogen fertilisers and poor land management have diminished the crucial wildlife habitat by 97% since the 1930s. But road verges have become an unlikely source of hope. Last September, the wildlife charity Plantlife produced new guidelines for transforming the management of the UK’s roadsides that incorporate some of Nicholson and Sterling’s practices. Crucially, the plan to turn verges into wildlife corridors is also backed by the country’s highways authorities and construction and services businesses such as Kier and Skanska. If adopted nationwide, an area the size of Nottinghamshire could see 700 species of wildflowers thriving along the road network in Great Britain, equivalent to around 40% of the government’s land restoration targets for 2040. A petition backing Plantlife’s campaign has more than 85,000 signatures. “It’s about bringing colour back to the countryside and to our roadsides. If we have that colour there, then we’ll have lots of other wildlife there as well,” says Plantlife botanist Trevor Dines. “Plants are the powerhouses of our food chains. They are the only things that are collecting energy from the sun and pumping it into the food chain. Without that diversity of plants there, you don’t get the diversity of other wildlife,” he adds. One 4.5-mile stretch in Dorset shows what is possible: the Weymouth relief road. Opened in 2011 ahead of sailing events at the Olympics, the seven hectares (17 acres) of verges that line one of the busiest roads in the county have become a crucial site for biodiversity. Yellow clusters of kidney vetch, the only wildflower where the small blue, Britain’s smallest butterfly, will lay its eggs, dominate the roadsides in the spring and summer. But the medicinal pea-like flowers, whose seeds can cost more than £2,000 a kilo from commercial providers, are not an extravagant token of the region’s Olympic legacy. “I harvested the seeds for that myself,” says Sterling, recounting the painstaking task of growing enough kidney vetch at recycling centres and flood bunds since the early 90s. “Now look how much there is.”  Since the road opened, more than half of the species of butterfly known to inhabit Britain have been recorded on the grasslands lining the road, including the Adonis blue and Chalkhill blue. Sterling has 10kg of of kidney vetch seed ready in his office for when the Stonehenge tunnel gets approval . “If you think about the species of butterfly that Weymouth relief road supports on seven hectares, what would it be like on a hundred hectares?” says Nicholson excitedly. “There’s a huge opportunity here in the UK to change what we’ve currently got,” says Sterling. “We can put back much of what we’ve lost. It’s not impossible to do. We haven’t gone beyond that tipping point where there is so little left that there’s no point. “If half the species of butterfly in the UK can turn up on a road verge created less than 10 years ago, then we do have the capabilities to do this, don’t we?” But such enthusiasm for Britain’s wildflowers are not apparent everywhere. Opposite a burger van in a ditch near Ely lies one of England’s rarest plants, the only known native fenland ragwort plant. The critically endangered wildflower, which is supposedly protected by being on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is surrounded by faded McDonald’s packaging and beer tins. The plant was only discovered when a French botanist from a nearby Cambridge research centre identified it while relieving himself in a layby in the 1960s, so the story goes. “It was the first sighting of fen ragwort since the mid to late 19th century, so getting on for 100 years, more or less,” says Tim Pankhurst, Plantlife’s conservation manager for the east of England, as lorries storm pass on the road that links Ely and Newmarket. “That’s it for fen ragwort. This is the sole native site in Britain. A lonely roadside ditch at the back of a verge near Ely.” The tall plant is a relic of how the fens, in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk, used to be: a vast expanse of marshland full of native birds and wildlife. Fen ragwort would have been torn up and moved around by flood waters, but since the region was drained in the 18th century, there’s now only one known native site. Restoring wildflower meadows in the agricultural heartlands of the UK by creating a network of wildlife corridors has become a particular focus for conservationists. The widest road verges in the country are in East Anglia, on the former drovers’ roads once used to transport livestock to London and other major cities. Small stretches in Lincolnshire have been managed as roadside nature reserves since the 1960s. Seated around a table in a rural pub near Spalding in Lincolnshire is an unlikely trio of wildflower revolutionaries taking Plantlife’s maintenance guidelines one step further. Derek Scott, an agricultural equipment manufacturer, Henry Dymoke, a local farmer and landowner, and Mark Schofield, a conservation officer at Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, have developed a machine that could spread the cut and collect method around the country. Scott’s company manufactures industry-standard machinery for vegetable washing, which is exported to every major agricultural economy. In 2018, Schofield convinced him to apply his engineering prowess to a pioneering tender by Lincolnshire County Council to create machinery that would allow the local authority to use the cut and collect method on hundreds of miles of road in the county. Crucially, the machinery had to be able to deliver the cuttings to an anaerobic digestion plant that could convert the grass into biogas, which is found at Dymoke’s farm, Scrivelsby Estate. The Vergenair 5.5 verge harvesting system is a JCB tractor, an Italian suction flail and a Larrington trailer. The bespoke machinery trundles along the roadsides, cutting the grass and sucking it into the trailer which can take up to 10,000kg to the anaerobic digestion plant. “We’re replacing a natural process. We see fossil records of the auroch, the ancestor of the modern-day cow in cave paintings. Predators would drive them on from place to place, they’d have routes to get to water and they’d be moving from one bit of grazing to another bit of grazing,” says Schofield. “Hay cutting is our replacement for the wild auroch, the tarpan, the horse, the red deer. You can’t unleash the auroch on the A158 but you can have an artificial beast that’s a lot more manageable.” The contraption allows the council to use the cut and collect, low fertility method across Lincolnshire and could go nationwide. But the project has come to an abrupt halt. The Environment Agency (EA) did not renew the permit for Lincolnshire to continue the trial due to concerns about waste codes and regulations. Because roadside verges are not being managed as a crop, they are formally classified as waste. To continue the project, Dymoke would have to purchase expensive new permits from the EA and invest thousands of pounds in upgrades to the anaerobic digestion plants. For now, Dorset and Lincolnshire lead an increasing number of councils in the quest to turn UK roadsides into the backbone of a nature recovery network where native plants and wildlife are free to re-emerge.

"Campaigners have warned that the fracking moratorium announced by the UK government does not apply to acid fracking, a process that involves injecting acid into the earth to dissolve and fracture rock. More than 500 academics, politicians and campaigners have signed an open letter initiated by Brockham Oil Watch calling on the government to ban the practice over fears companies may use it to get around the moratorium. Lawyers and academics said regulation of the use of acid in oil and gas wells is vague and could be exploited. Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, is one of the letter’s signatories. “It isn’t acceptable just to have half a moratorium. The definition [of fracking] needs to be expanded, regulations need to apply right across all forms of unconventional drilling, and local communities need to know what’s going on beneath their feet.” No permits have yet been granted for acid stimulation in England, although oil and gas companies, along with water companies, commonly use acid wash to clean wells. Campaigners fear the lack of monitoring of acid use could lead to “fracking by stealth” through matrix acidising, where liquid is injected into the earth at low pressure to dissolve rock, or acid fracturing or fracking, where the acid is used at high pressure to fracture the rock. Residents in Wressle, north Lincolnshire are waiting on the outcome of a public inquiry which took place in November last year to decide whether onshore oil and gas company Egdon can continue drilling at its site in the area. The company’s plans involve using an “proppant squeeze” that would dissolve rock around the well and can create small fractures. The newly elected Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole, Andrew Percy has previously described fracking as “industrialisation of the countryside” and said affected communities should be given more power over the issue – although he had previously voted against tighter fracking regulation. Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, said the UK government’s definition of fracking is part of the problem. “Most countries define fracking as the intention to fracture the rock, but the UK takes the use of quite a large volume of fluid as the definition of fracking,” he said. “It’s quite possible to use a small volume of fluid to frack the rock, including acid, without actually naming it as fracking and without going through the formal permissions for fracking.” His analysis shows that of 4,500 oil wells fracked in the US from 2000-10, 89% would not be defined as fracking in the UK, along with 43% of US gas wells fracked over the same period. “This is a clear opportunity for gaming the system so I argue that acid treatments onshore should stop, until a coherent set of regulations is produced and with clarity about who polices those regulations.” Campaigners claim acid stimulation brings with it many of the same risks as fracking, such as water, soil and air contamination, and earth tremors. The Weald in Surrey and Sussex is a prime target for onshore oil and gas extraction. A local resident has launched a campaign to fund a judicial review into the council’s decision to grant 20 more years of oil production at the Horse Hill site near Horley. Brenda Pollack, the south-east regional campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said residents near areas at risk of potential acid fracking should remain vigilant. She said: “It could be worse for those communities now because with this moratorium, companies are going to be turning to those sites where they can get their feet in the door, or their drills in the ground.” However, industry representatives say the use of acid is standard practice and should not cause concern. Ken Cronin, the chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said: “Acidisation, both in the water industry and our own, is a regulated practice that allows us to effectively ‘clean’ or improve recovery from a well. It dissolves fine particles and scale, allowing a better flow of what we’re trying to extract. “As with household kettles, which need to be treated for limescale build-up, the use of this process merely increases the efficiency of our practices. An environmental permit is only issued for this technique if the Environment Agency are satisfied that the proposed activities meet the requirements of all the relevant legislation.”"
"As mild temperatures and spring blooms emerged in southern Utah this past weekend, so did the tourists. At Capitol Reef national park, the trailhead parking lot was full of cars bearing plates from states such as California, Washington, Colorado and Georgia, all Covid-19 hotspots. The hikers were either oblivious to or ignoring the plea from the local sheriff’s office that outsiders stay away. “While we would normally welcome visitors to enjoy the beauty of Wayne county, we really don’t want visitors during the Covid-19 pandemic,” stated a 3 April post on the sheriff’s Facebook page. Wayne county, where Capitol Reef is located, has 2,600 residents and little in the way of healthcare services. “If you don’t live here, please don’t come here.”  The crown jewels in the US national park system, like Grand Canyon and Zion, were shuttered last week after days of petitioning from local health authorities, but 284 of the 419 units in the national park system remain fully or partially open to visitors. They are parks such as Capitol Reef, renowned for a colorful series of sandstone cliffs. Even after the main scenic drive was closed on Sunday to try to discourage visitors, the park itself remained open. The National Park Service (NPS) “asks visitors to follow CDC guidance as well as state and local orders in order to protect themselves and others”, said Chelsea Sullivan, a public affairs specialist at NPS headquarters in Washington DC. Sullivan said there are no immediate plans for an agency-wide shut down. “Where it is possible to adhere to federal, state and local public health guidance, outdoor spaces will remain accessible to the public.”  But many NPS employees on the frontlines disagree with the agency’s approach. “It is irresponsible for us to be open because we are aiding in the spread of the virus,” said a manager at a national park in the midwest who has witnessed visitation increase over the past several weeks. Last Friday, the park hosted visitors from as far away as New York and Florida, including a man who said he was visiting every national park after being laid off from his job. Even as governors from 42 states have issued stay-at-home orders, the park manager, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, pointed out that the National Park Service is encouraging vacation-type travel. “Something bigger is going on, people are on the move,” said the manager. “More than half of our visitors are from outside the region and that is not typical for us.” According to information provided to the Guardian, superintendents at numerous parks that are experiencing rises in visitation are seeking permission to close completely. However, getting approval from the Department of Interior to shut down requires that state and county health authorities petition the interior secretary and make the case that the park poses a public health threat. In the absence of this approval, superintendents have implemented piecemeal facility closures to try to protect staff from exposure to coronavirus, such as shutting visitor centers and closing roads. But rangers, first responders and maintenance employees are still on the job and interacting with visitors. “We are seeing increased visitation right now, especially on weekends,” said a ranger working at Minuteman national historical park in Concord, Massachusetts. The ranger noted that buildings in the 970-acre park were closed but the trails were open. “We are trying to be a refuge for people.” According to data from the New York Times, there were more than 2,600 coronavirus cases in Middlesex county, where the park is located. For the millions of Americans who are feeling chained to their houses, getting outdoors is often the brightest part of the day. But national parks are designed to concentrate people on to developed trails to protect the environment, and this makes following current CDC guidelines for social distancing tough. “I wish we could find refuge in national parks right now but in many cases the parks are too crowded to be safe,” said Phil Francis, chair of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, which represents more than 1,800 current and retired NPS employees. “It’s just not possible to keep people far enough apart on the trails. If CDC guidelines aren’t being followed then the parks need to be closed.” In addition to hazards posed to park staff and locals in communities where parks are located, the cross-country travel that national park visitation encourages poses its own threat. “People want to drive out to where it’s beautiful,” said Steve Howe, a canyoneering guide living near Capitol Reef, “but they are visiting all the services en route and transmitting disease from areas of high urban density to rural areas every time they stop for gas or at a convenience store. Even though there are no Covid-19 cases here right now, I expect there will be soon from the spillover effect of people passing through.” Griffin’s, the only grocery store in the southern Utah town of Escalante, implemented restrictions beginning on Sunday that limit store entry to residents. Escalante is located on a popular scenic byway between Capitol Reef and Bryce Canyon national park, which is also open.  Howe, who owns a small guiding company and has seen his business evaporate with the spread of Covid-19, was glad Capitol Reef closed its main road but is skeptical people will stay home. “When America thinks of going out into nature, they think of going to parks,” he said. “I am not looking forward to the Easter weekend madness.”"

"Our world is cribbed, confined and bound in as never before. Yet amid all the fear and horror, there is one silver lining, as we reconnect with nature on our doorstep. My Somerset garden is awash with birdsong: chiffchaffs, wrens, robins and a new arrival, the blackcap, all competing to see who can shout the loudest as spring gathers pace. Overhead, buzzards soar and ravens tumble, as delighted as I am to herald the new season. But to hear a bird whose song is the definitive sound of the countryside, I must take my daily exercise: a walk with our fox-red labrador Rosie around Blackford Moor, the little patch of land behind our home. I’ve seen some memorable birds here over the years, not least a female marsh harrier passing through on migration, just a week or so ago. But as with any local patch, it’s all about the commonplace; and here, and especially now, the ubiquitous bird is the skylark. A plump, triangular-winged shape rises up from the lane in front of us, then rapidly gains height, while continuing to deliver an outpouring of song: a rapid jumble of notes that seems to go on forever, even when the bird vanishes into the ether. As the dog and I stand and watch, I feel a new book coming on: “Skylarks with Rosie”?"
"Look up, we’re told. When confined by walls, fences, buildings, when confounded by civilisation, look up and feel your heart lift. The other day I looked up and saw an air ambulance in descent overhead, sunlit and cowslip-yellow, its downdraughts hammering the roofs of our mill town. I held my binoculars on it for a while – then noticed, beyond it, like a tiny smut on the lens, a buzzard, working a wide curve on the brink of sight. Our house has no garden, but it came with a lot of sky. Usually the regulars have it to themselves – black-headed gulls elbow languidly along, pigeons perform cryptic soap operas of flight, antsy jackdaws always seem to need to be somewhere else – but every now and then we have sparrowhawks, too. Kestrels nest at the foot of the disused mill chimney. Once or twice, a peregrine has sailed in, all burly charisma, show-offy strut. And buzzards – more than ever, this spring. Today’s buzzard is as low in the sky as I’ve seen one here. I’m out on my walk. I wasn’t looking up until it drifted into my periphery; now I am. I can make out its long-fingered wings and tightly ruddering tail, its maculate underside. As common as anything, these days, buzzards – there’s nowhere they’re not in Britain – but a big raptor, up close, will always stop you in the street. This one rides its winding thermal across the double track of a plane’s contrail. Most of the buzzards I see here come drifting in from the north, over the brink of the great gritstone hummock that separates us from the Wharfe valley. They nose their way warily into our airspace, mentally mapping out the cricket fields, football pitches, wooded parkland below. They are insistently territorial, so I suppose they reckon that in, too – this is mine now, this is mine now, and this, and this… Today’s seems quite at home just a cherrypicker’s height above our sandstone gables. It’s silly, but at this time of human withdrawal I can’t help wondering if the birds are growing bolder. Later, I watch a magpie stroll slowly across a neighbour’s shed roof. Not a worry in the world."
" The energy corporations SSE and RWE have shut the door on coal-fired power generation by closing the Fiddler’s Ferry power station in Warrington, Cheshire, and the Aberthaw coal plant in Wales after almost 50 years. The Fiddler’s Ferry power plant began generating enough electricity to power 2m homes in 1973 and is officially closing on Tuesday. The Aberthaw plant, which is slightly smaller and first began helping to power the UK electricity system in 1971, is shutting on the same day. The shutdown of SSE and RWE’s last remaining coal plants leaves only four remaining coal plants in the UK ahead of the government’s ban on coal-fired power from 2025. SSE set out the “difficult decision” to close Fiddler’s Ferry last summer, saying the plant was losing about £40m a year and could not compete with the economics of modern gas-fired power stations and renewable energy. Stephen Wheeler, the managing director of SSE’s fossil fuel business, said the closure was a landmark moment for the company and the wider energy industry, as the UK moves towards a net zero carbon future. “It’s made a huge contribution to the local area, but it’s the right thing to do as the UK continues to move to cleaner ways of producing energy and take action on climate change,” he said. “SSE is now the UK’s leading generator of renewable energy and we have committed to trebling our output by 2030,” he added. “We will back up this renewable generation with super-efficient gas-fired plants, which we are also looking to decarbonise through emerging carbon capture and hydrogen technology.” The FTSE 100 energy company expects to report a 25% jump in operating profits from its renewable energy business for last year after its Beatrice offshore windfarm began generating electricity at full power. All of the UK’s coal-fired power plants will need to shut by 2025 after the government called for a ban on burning coal for electricity, which typically produces double the carbon emissions compared with a gas-fired power plant. Many of the UK’s remaining coal plants have decided to shut earlier than the deadline because the plants are considered uneconomic to run in the UK due to a government tax on carbon. Coal-fired electricity made up only 2.1% of the UK’s total power mix last year, a dramatic fall from only four years ago when coal powered almost a quarter of the electricity system. Britain’s dwindling fleet of coal plants still includes the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal plants in Nottinghamshire, the Kilroot coal plant in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas."
"In mid-March, shortly after the Navajo Nation declared a public health state of emergency, Ethel Branch went out to stock up on supplies for her elderly mother and nieces who live on the Native American reservation. Branch, who lives in Flagstaff, Arizona, spent all day going from store to store trying to find canned soups, soap and toilet paper. Many had sold out, while others were price gouging amid rising panic about the coronavirus pandemic. Branch started calling friends looking for ideas about how to ensure the tribe’s most vulnerable families got enough food, water and hygiene supplies without risking their lives by traveling long distances. It was not easy. The Navajo Nation is the second-biggest tribal group in the US, with 332,000 people, according to the last census. But unemployment on the reservation hovers around 50% and it is also a food desert with only 13 grocery stores for 180,000 people. One in three people do not have running water or electricity. “I’d been monitoring developments [in Asia] since January, and knew when it hit us, it would be really bad so we had to get prepared,” said Branch, 40, who served as the Nation’s attorney general between 2015 and 2019. With these harsh realities in mind, Branch and her friends created the Navajo & Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund, and started a GoFundMe page. By Thursday, $267,000 had been donated and a small army of volunteers was coordinating a full-scale emergency response to distribute crucial supplies to needy families across the vast Navajo territory and the neighboring Hopi reservation, where three small convenience stores serve almost 3,000 people. So far, more than 2,000 households have registered for help – some online but most by calling a call center volunteer who asks them about how much food they have left, allergies and medical needs, in order to prioritize orders. Hundreds of care packages – containing core items such as flour, beans, rice, canned soups, dried meat, fever and cough medicine, as well as fresh vegetables, fruit and meat when available, have been delivered to elders caring for grandchildren and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Fifty went to Chilchinbeto, a close-knit community of 500 people which has been locked down since the first localized spread was detected. The volunteer effort is an example of what the Navajo call T’áá hwó ajít’éego, or self-reliance and self-determination. “There’s no fixed model, we do what needs to be done, to get supplies where they are needed as fast and safely as possible through our network,” Branch told the Guardian. The volunteer – and government – efforts are a mammoth task given the size and geography of the Nation which stretches 27,000 square miles over the south-western Colorado plateau across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The territory, which is roughly the size of West Virginia, includes arid deserts and alpine forests with high plateaus, mesas and mountains reaching over 10,000ft in altitude. In addition to economic and topographic challenges, the coronavirus pandemic represents particular risks to the Navajo – and other tribal nations – as rates of cancer, heart and respiratory diseases and diabetes are comparatively higher than in the non-Native populations, while tribal health services have been underfunded for decades. Amid growing concern, the Navajo government issued a shelter-in-place order on 21 March – two days after California – shutting down all non-essential government services and businesses. “The order is to make sure we flatten the curve as soon as possible, and that means getting supplies to our most vulnerable residents and shelters so people stay home, and stay safe,” said tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty. “Water is now our number one priority.” Even before this crisis, access to water on the Navajo reservation was incredibly complicated. At least 30% must rely on unregulated wells and springs – which can be unsafe as many groundwater sources are contaminated by some 523 abandoned uranium mines – or travel up to 40 miles to replenish tanks and buy bottled water to meet basic needs like drinking, cooking and bathing. The limited access to clean, running water made following coronavirus prevention guidelines such as frequent hand-washing challenging. Now, many government water distribution points have closed, while others have cut their hours to comply with the stay-at-home order. Finding a reliable bulk water supplier is a priority for Branch’s group as local stores and distributors expect shortages over coming weeks. The Navajo women driving this grassroots relief effort bring a range of business, public service and organizing experience, and include the owner of a home care company, a director of a not-for-profit small business incubator, and head of the department of corrections. These skills and contacts enabled them to make deals with wholesalers, and set up distribution points where volunteers sanitize items before trucking them to households in far-flung communities like Tuba City, Black Mesa and Hopi. The baskets are left on the doorstep, to minimize unnecessary physical contact. So far, 214 Covid-19 cases including seven deaths had been confirmed on the Nation. “It warms the heart,” said longstanding tribal council delegate Daniel Tso. “It brings tears to my eyes to see people organizing and risking their own health to protect the elderly and vulnerable children, it really shows the strength of the Navajo people.”"
"At Europe’s busiest port, in Rotterdam, Reverend Dennis Woodward has adapted his routine. Before the coronavirus pandemic struck, Woodward was one of 20 chaplains and volunteers from maritime welfare groups who boarded ships at this port to offer help to the 500,000 seafarers who pass through here every year. Now, he is the only one left.  As he travels from ship to ship, he now dons disposable gloves, keeps two metres from the crew and stops at the top of the gangway, rather than enter vessels. But he doesn’t wear a face mask: he feels it is important to show his face. “They are anxious and lonely,” Woodward, a chaplain for the Mission to Seafarers, told the Guardian. “One seafarer almost cried when I told him I was the last chaplain still visiting ships in the port. He was a seafarer from the Philippines and, like myself, had two small children. He was misty-eyed. He was checking in daily with his family, but coronavirus is also in the Philippines and they are thousands of miles away.” The port is vital to the global supply chain of food, medicine and other goods, and many of the seafarers who work the container ships have not been ashore in months – and may not be able to land for some time yet. “They are tough guys and they tend not to show it, but you can see it in their eyes,” says Woodward. “They are anxious. Their families are often thousands of miles away, in countries that are in lockdown. At this time, what they can’t offer their families is protection. That is what they are worried about. We are all human and this is a big unknown.” Anxiety is growing among crews. Some have reported non-payment of wages, or contracts being extended without consent. Other seafarers have been stranded in foreign ports without wages or flights home.  Shipping organisations and seafarers unions are urging governments to make travel easier for ships’ crews, amid reports of thousands of seamen becoming stranded on their vessels after their contracts have ended, due to coronavirus restrictions and a lack of international flights.  In normal circumstances, Woodward, a dual British-Dutch national who was ordained in Cambridge and lives with his wife and two children in Schiedam, in the Netherlands, would offer seafarers a trip ashore to the supermarket to get supplies, a much-needed sim card to stay in touch with family, or pastoral support. “Now, I try to have a brief conversation – about how grateful we are for their work keeping global supply chains open. I say, I’m here to say thank you and unfortunately, then I will have to leave you. I’m unable to have the in-depth pastoral conversations we usually have,” he says. In recent weeks, Woodward has visited seafarers from the Philippines, India, Russia, the Ukraine and Romania. “Most people don’t realise it but these seafarers are essential workers,” he says. “Our heroes are the nurses and doctors, in the NHS and elsewhere – but without seafarers, how would the supermarkets work? We know that medical supplies and groceries are coming out of the port. If all that stopped … it is unimaginable.” This week the UK became the first country to recognise seafarers as “key workers” , following pressure from the international chamber of shipping, the UK chamber of shipping, transport unions and maritime charities. Earlier this month, Woodward received a WhatsApp message from a seaman from Mindanao, in the Philippines, who was desperate to see his wife and daughter, now in lockdown. The man’s contract, on a vessel sailing in the Mediterranean, had ended in December and was extended for a month – but after Covid-19 struck, requests from the ship to countries including Turkey and Israel to allow it to dock were turned down. He has now been at sea for a year. “This has become a real issue, with many seafarers finding themselves trapped onboard their vessel, not allowed to disembark by their companies, the port state or the flag state,” Woodward says. “This needs urgent intervention and a sustainable solution, before it’s too late.” Woodward will continue his work as long as it’s safe, he says. On Monday he visited five ships and distributed bags to the men, containing woolly hats, bibles and hand-written cards from children thanking the seafarers for their work. These gifts have touched many, he said, including a Filipino father of two he met last week. “He was blown away,” Woodward recalls. “He just said, ‘Wow’. A simple thank you from a child.”"
"In November 1966, the Gemini 12 spacecraft, carrying two astronauts, splashed down in the Pacific. The four-day mission was a triumph, proving that humans could work in outer space, and even step into the great unknown, albeit tethered to their spacecraft. It catapulted the US ahead of the USSR in the space race. From then, Nasa’s goal was to beat the Russians to the moon. That meant weeks rather than days in space, in an isolated, claustrophobic environment. There was one perfect way to prepare humans for these conditions: going underwater. The world was gripped. If we could land people on the moon, why not colonise the ocean as well? Nasa scientists were not the first to dream of marine living. Evidence of submarines and diving bells can be found as far back as the 16th century. The literary grandfather of all things deep, Jules Verne, popularised the idea of a more sophisticated underwater life with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea in 1872, but it was in the 20th century that the fascination really took hold. In the 1930s, American naturalist William Beebe and engineer Otis Barton collaborated on experimental submersibles called bathyspheres which set records for deep diving and opened up the underwater realm of plants and animals to science. Swiss physicist and oceanographer Auguste Piccard created the bathyscaphe (which used floats rather than surface cables) in 1946, and his son, Jacques, was on the record-breaking voyage to explore the Mariana Trench, the deepest place on Earth, in 1960. Auguste also created the mesoscaphe – the world’s first passenger submarine – in 1964. The craze for living in the depths, rather than merely visiting, started in the 1960s, when Jacques-Yves Cousteau – inventor of scuba, wearer of red woolly hats and inspiration for ze French Narrator in Spongebob – brought the ocean vividly to life for millions around the world through his documentaries about life aboard his vessel Calypso. To Cousteau, the life subaquatic was, above all, for living. “Being French, he made sure his diving never got in the way of mealtimes,” writes author John Crace of Cousteau’s documentaries. “In fact, food and wine take almost equal precedence with the oceans in these films. No one is ever without a pipe or cigarette in their mouth, either. Except underwater, of course.” Cousteau channelled this vision of oceanic life into his underwater habitats, known as Conshelf (Continental Shelf Station). George F Bond, the father of saturation diving and head of the US navy’s Man-in-the-Sea programme, approached Cousteau with funding from the French oil industry: they wanted manned colonies at sea in order to help with future exploration. Together, Bond and Cousteau built three Conshelfs. The first, in 1962, was suspended 10 metres under the water off the coast of Marseilles, but Conshelf II was a starfish-shaped “underwater village” that sat on the seabed proper, 30 metres down in the Red Sea off Sudan. It contained all the accoutrements of la vie louche, including television and radio. Cousteau used it as a base to explore the ocean in his yellow submarine, descending to 300 metres to capture the deepest footage yet recorded. His team spent 30 days beneath the waves, and in the process changed humanity’s relationship with the ocean by proving that “saturation diving” could allow people to spend long periods underwater. By diving to a certain depth, divers saturate their bodies with the inert gases in air. This allows them to exist at the extreme pressure of the ocean floor. It typically involves breathing a mix of helium and oxygen, to avoid the possibility of the bends and nitrogen narcosis. Conshelf sparked a craze. Sealab, Hydrolab, Edalhab, Helgoland, Galathee, Aquabulle, Hippocampe – more than 60 underwater habitats were dotted across the seabeds in the late 60s and early 70s from the Baltic to the Gulf of Mexico. The craze even inspired two British teenagers, Colin Irwin and John Heath, to raise £1,000 to build Glaucus in 1965, which was little more than a cylindrical steel tank weighed down by old railway ties. “We all thought at the time, ‘This is the future’,” Irwin told the BBC on Glaucus’s 50th anniversary. “We may not populate the moon, but we’re going to have villages all over the continental shelf, and we thought it’s about time the British did the same thing.” They dropped it in the waters of Plymouth Sound and spent a week inside. It is the Nasa missions, however, that remain the most iconic of the 60s underwater living experiments. This is in large part due to the marine biologist Sylvia Earle, one of the most famous explorers of her generation. In 1969, Earle made history with Mission 6, when she and an all-female team of scientists spent two weeks on Nasa’s habitat Tektite (named after meteor remnants on the seabed). This Virgin Islands research facility was for studying aquatic life – marine science, engineering and construction underwater – and small-crew psychology in extreme conditions. The research was for the Apollo missions and the moon landing was just months away. Built by General Electric, Earle and her team would enter Tektite through what she calls an “underwater door” – emerging as if from a swimming pool into the deep-sea two-up, two-down apartment. It was dry, climate-controlled and comfortable, with carpets, bunks and a hot freshwater shower to wash off the salt. It even had a microwave. “Nasa had a team of psychologists watching to get insight into behaviour of living in isolation,” says Earle today. “We were there as guinea pigs: our research was on the oceans, their research was on us.” But Tektite wasn’t just a research station – it was a vision of stylish underwater living. With their scientific gear and Charlie’s Angels wetsuits in their Bond-villain lair, Earle and her team caused a media sensation. “They called us the aquababes, the aquanaughties, all sorts of things,” Earle recalls with a snort. “We speculated what they would say about the astronauts if they were seen the same way – would they be the astrohunks?” Habitats such as Glaucus, Conshelf and Tektite were built as tributes to humankind’s abilities, but their true achievement was to spark an entirely different understanding of marine animals. “Back then we could only explore using nets, and just saw dead bodies – not living creatures. Having the continuous interaction allowed us to get to know individual animals,” Earle says. “[In underwater habitats] we could stay, the way you look at bears or birds: we were there for the long haul, 24 hours a day or night. It was possible to see how a little group of damselfish reacted when a predator tried to swipe their eggs, for example. “You look at a school of fish and they all look alike, but when you really look at them – well, it’s like a bunch of people getting on the New York subway: a fish would say they all look the same, but we know they’re different. Getting to appreciate the individuality of creatures other than humans was a breakthrough for me – it reinforces that you can’t just lump them all together.” But, in 1973, the world was shaken when Opec declared an oil embargo. Energy prices in the west skyrocketed. At first, the oil shock fuelled even wilder fantasies of a watery future, straight out of science fiction. Architects and designers imagined whole cities underwater, fed by hydropower stations, with deep-sea mining using freight submarines. Much like living in space, though, it’s extremely difficult to live underwater. Aquanauts spending months in saturation suffered intense pressures on their body tissues – their brains, nervous systems. There were also interpersonal problems. As the marine biologist Helen Scales notes in her 2014 radio documentary The Life Sub-Aquatic:“If you’ve ever lived in a house with anyone, the first thing you do is storm out if you have a quarrel. You’re not going to do that [underwater].” Advances in robotics changed the game. Much of the research being done by Earle and her colleagues could be more efficiently performed by humans operating devices remotely from the surface. By the end of the 70s, the US government pulled back on its efforts. The moon missions were over. So, it seemed, were the ocean habitats. A few people refused to let the dream die. One was Australian Lloyd Godson. His habitat, BioSub, experimented with sustainability. Fuelled by solar panels, it featured a support system adapted from work by American high school students, with algae removing the CO2 from his exhalations and creating oxygen. In 2007 he moved in. It worked – sort of. “By day 12 I was lethargic, getting really irritated with people asking questions,” he told the BBC. “My wife told me to call it a day.” In 2010 Godson spent 14 days underwater at the Legoland aquarium in Germany and used a fixed bicycle to set a world record for generating electricity underwater. Better funded is the French architect Jacques Rougerie, who has built a career designing underwater habitats and environments. “I had the pleasure of going on Cousteau’s Calypso, participating in expeditions, talking to the crew – and what he created was a fascination for underwater living,” Rougerie says from his office in Paris. “The early explorers opened the chamber of the possible for humanity. When you are underwater you feel like you’re in a new dimension – floating in space, like an astronaut.” Citing Leonardo da Vinci as an inspiration, Rougerie designs sea museums, underwater laboratories and habitats, and his foundation hosts an annual competition for students to conceive of underwater villages. Rougerie himself has twice lived for long periods underwater, and both times he didn’t want to return to land. “Sadness invades you,” he says. “I was happy to come back and see family, but the first thing you think of is the next experience.” Rougerie’s ultimate goal remains that old 1960s dream: a proper underwater village, housing up to 250 people. In his vision, these aquanaut settlers would live in osmosis with the ocean, in a self-sufficient, autonomous community running on renewable marine energy such as tidal power, wave sensors and ocean thermals. Perhaps most ambitious of all is SeaOrbiter, Rougerie’s take on the International Space Station for the ocean. It looks like a floating seahorse: two-thirds of its 51 metres are submerged, with panoramic windows, the lower section acting to stabilise a huge sail-shaped portion above water. “The goal, above all, is to help the climate and biodiversity by exploring across the grand currents of the ocean,” he says. “To float 24/7 on a permanent structure, a combination of men and robots with a scientific purpose.” Despite Rougerie’s claims that he has secured Chinese investment, SeaOrbiter appears no closer to pushing off. Indeed, after all the projects of the past 50 years, only one permanent underwater habitat remains on the entire planet: Aquarius Reef Base, a research station run by Florida International University and which sits 20 metres down on the seabed off the Florida Keys. Aquarius plays host to a stream of people – scientists, film-makers, astronauts, even Jacques Cousteau’s grandson Fabien – who want to experience time underwater. As part of Nasa’s Extreme Environment Mission Operations (Neemo), the Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, famous for singing David Bowie songs aboard the International Space Station in 2013, used Aquarius to train. But Aquarius is still just a small research station, with room for just six people. In the 21st century, underwater “living” has become almost exclusively the preserve of hotels and resorts that sell “experiences” to guests via underwater glass ceilings and fish windows. The world’s largest underwater restaurant opened in Norway in 2019. Submerged hotels in the Maldives, Fiji, Dubai and Singapore use elevators to take guests below the waterline, and feature amenities such as Poseidon’s undersea chapel (“for a wedding ceremony or vow renewal truly unlike any other”), and are a lot more comfortable than Tektite ever was. Instead, the architects and scientists who still look to aquatic habitation spend most of their time thinking not about underwater cities, but floating ones. Long the refuge of the poorest city dwellers, such as the vast Makoko floating slum of homes on stilts in Lagos, houses on water have become newly popular as waterfront property prices – and sea levels – have risen across the world. So far, most of this effort to colonise the water has gone into land reclamation projects, such as the Odaiba island in Tokyo, or South Korea’s Songdo “smart city”. Architects in Dubai even tried to create a scale model of the entire Earth off its coast. However, reclamation is expensive, and requires constant maintenance to keep the ocean from reclaiming the space. Japan’s Kansai airport is sinking. Architect Koen Olthuis thinks it’s more natural for cities to spread by floating. His firm Waterstudio builds floating buildings, mainly in the Netherlands, to help cities be more resilient. Recently, Olthuis started adding submerged levels to his structures. “In Holland the licences for dwellings on the water are small, but they say nothing about living underwater.” The goal is partly ecological, Olthuis says. “Ten years ago, it was about proving that a structure did not have a negative effect – but now it’s about also having a positive effect.” He points to the “rigs to reefs” principle where abandoned oil rigs have been transformed into habitats for ocean life. Waterstudio’s Sea Tree builds on that concept: it’s a platform that attracts birds, bees, fish and water plants into a single dense floating structure that can be moved between cities. He says the first Sea Trees have been commissioned by a Chinese developer in Kunming, who was asked to create a tourist attraction after a dam permanently altered the landscape. The Bjarke Ingels Group last year revealed a concept for a buoyant municipality called Oceanix City – a modular system of floating islands clustered in multiples of six to form a kind of archipelago. Meanwhile, the Seasteading Institute, founded by PayPal’s Peter Thiel and the grandson of the economist Milton Friedman, continues to pursue its libertarian goal of floating communities living outside the boundaries of national law. The Chinese construction giant CCCC has a design similar to Oceanix City, while the architect Vincent Callebaut has imagined a city called Lilypad with a series of oceanic skyscrapers that would house 50,000 people. “I see blue cities,” says Olthuis. “Not floating cities. Just a city growing over water, taking advantage of the floating structures but in the same pattern as on land – a kind of Venice but floating, that can be used in New York, Miami … any city that’s threatened by water.” The craze for deep-sea living wasn’t entirely folly, though. Rougerie says that time beneath the waves changes our outlook on the planet, helping inspire the environmental movement. It’s why continues to sponsor the competition to design underwater cities. “The biggest threat to our ocean is man: pollution, chemical and plastic. But I’m convinced that the young have a conscience and they’ll do everything in their power – they’re totally committed and willing to find a solution.” Sylvia Earle, too, believes that man’s understanding of the universe has been changed by underwater exploration. “In the last 50 years,” she says, “two major things have happened: the expansion of our technology into the skies above – which has given us great insights into the blue speck in the universe that we couldn’t understand any other way – and going deep in the ocean, which has also changed everything. “It has taught us that life exists everywhere, even in the greatest depths; that most of life is in the oceans; and that oceans govern climate. Perhaps because we’re so terrestrially biased, air-breathing creatures that we are, it has taken us until now to realise that everything we care about is anchored in the ocean. “It’s the ocean that drives planetary systems – and we have done more harm to our life-support system in the last 50 years than we have in all previous human history,” she says. “If we fail the ocean, nothing else matters.”"
"The leader of the UK’s biggest farming organisation says she is optimistic that British workers will come forward to rescue the harvest and keep the nation fed, instead of having to rely on flying in overseas workers. “A lot of signs are optimistic and we have really positive news,” said Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union. “We are hearing people are very keen [to work on farms]. There does seem to be a real swell of support from people to do this.” She said workers who had been furloughed were allowed to top up their income through farm work, and many others who had lost their jobs would see it as a lifeline, as well as a way to help the country through the coronavirus crisis. Workers have been flown in this week on charter flights from Romania, despite travel restrictions and fears for their health and safety. Germany has also been recruiting farm workers by air from eastern Europe. About 80,000 workers are likely to be needed this year, leading to calls for a “land army” of paid workers to join farms. Batters said there was still time for more people to sign up, as the critical period for the UK’s harvest would not begin until next month. “We will know much more when we get to May,” she said. However, even if the labour shortages are less severe than some have predicted, farmers across the country are still facing a struggle to stay in business as their supply chains have been turned upside down by the coronavirus crisis. For farmers, the biggest single problem is that before the lockdown about half of the food consumed in the UK was eaten outside the home, in cafes, restaurants and pubs. Now they are closed, supermarkets are struggling to keep up with demand for grocery shopping, but farmers used to supplying the catering trade have few ways of getting their produce to consumers. “It is very difficult, if not impossible, to switch,” said Batters. Food must meet different standards when sold through supermarkets, and adapting the supply chain takes longer than farmers have to sell their perishable produce. “If you’re a potato farmer, and you sold to fish and chip shops, you can’t just start selling your produce direct. You can sell some at the end of the farm drive, but that’s only going to make a small difference,” said Batters. Ministers have been slow to act, said Martin Lines, chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. “We have heard very little from the government on how they will be supporting farmers to effectively make this transition and we urge them to look at appropriate ways to deliver a clear food delivery strategy that supports short, sustainable supply chains during the pandemic and beyond,” he said. Selling directly to consumers remains difficult, even for farmers who have set up their business that way. Charlie Cole, a livestock farmer at Broughgammon farm in Northern Ireland, said: “It’s been an absolute nightmare. Our business is completely dependent on us selling directly to the customer. So now that the government restrictions are in place, the farmers’ markets and street food events have come to a close and we’ve had to shut the cafe in the farm shop, which are all usually reliable sources of income.” The cancellation of Wimbledon means its strawberry supplier in Kent is faced with 33 tonnes of perishable soft fruit with no market. Marion Regan, whose great-grandfather established Hugh Lowe Farms in Kent in 1893 with a Covent Garden stall, is now looking at alternatives. “We will find a home for them,” she told the Oxford Farming Conference podcast. She said she was talking to food banks as well as commercial outlets. The difference between what we eat at home and our tastes when eating out is also causing problems. Our love of mince is a menace to livestock farmers, who have seen the meat market collapse even while supermarkets have been stocking their shelves with meat imported from Poland. People are eating far more mince, which is cheap and comes from the tougher end of the animal, instead of the more expensive cuts, such as steak, that we tend to choose when eating out. As farmers need to sell whole carcasses, they are forced to sell at far below the true value. “If everyone wants mince, the carcass is massively devalued,” said Batters. “People want to buy British beef. If it has to be mince, OK, but you must balance the carcass [if necessary by mincing prime cuts] and stabilise the price, or people will go out of business.” Coffee shops used to account for a large proportion of the UK’s fresh milk sales, but when drinking at home people tend not to make the milky cappuccinos and lattes that they would buy when out. Dairy farmers are seeing prices so low that some have been throwing fresh milk down the drain without a buyer to collect it from the farm. Supermarkets imposed buying limits to stop people stocking up on some items, including milk and eggs. But Batters said there was no reason for limiting the amount of dairy produce people can purchase as there was no shortage of supply. Small farmers were most at risk from the crisis, Batters warned, as they had less to fall back on and were finding it hard to gain credit extensions from their banks. Farmers who diversified, as they were urged to, into side businesses such as running B&Bs are also finding those sources drying up. “Normally we would make £7,000 off tourism per year, but that income is going to vanish,” said Polly Davies, a tenant farmer in Glamorgan. Batters will urge ministers at a virtual meeting on Friday to give British farmers a boost by mandating all food bought by public bodies, including the NHS and the army, to come from British producers. “The government has a key role to play, that needs to be recognised,” she said. “If there is to be a positive legacy from this crisis, let’s build a more resilient economic future – paying attention to our food and our health, and buying local food, is a key part of that.”"
"Footage which appears to show Irish calves being beaten and kicked at a French feeding station has been published by animal campaign groups. The video, published by Eyes on Animals (EoA) and French welfare organisation L214, appears to show workers repeatedly beating calves that are a few weeks old with sticks. One is kicked and another is dragged away, unable to stand. The calf was euthanised by a vet, said an EoA observer. Ireland’s dairy sector, which earned the country €4.4bn (£3.9bn) in export revenues last year, relies heavily on veal farms in mainland Europe to buy unwanted male dairy calves. Dairy cows must produce calves in order to continue producing milk, but male calves are no use to the industry: they are known as “shipping-calves” in the Irish agricultural press. The latest figures from Ireland’s national agricultural body, Teagasc, show there are just over 1.4 million dairy cows in Ireland this year, each of which will calve once, producing approximately 700,000 male calves. Figures from the agriculture ministry show almost 247,000 cattle were exported from the country in 2018. Last month animal welfare campaigners followed calf trucks from the Irish port of Rosslare to the French port of Cherbourg. They documented a number of welfare and transport infractions. EU law obliges calf transporters to feed and rest calves after nine hours of travel, “‘if necessary”. After a second nine-hour journey, or a total of 18 hours’ transport, calves must be fed and rested for 12 hours. But Lesley Moffat of EoA said that from what her team had witnessed, “including the time it takes to move calves to and from ports, plus a boat journey of about 18 hours, the calves had been on the road for an estimated 23 hours without milk or milk replacer, well above the legal maximum of 18 hours.” Campaigners described the handling of calves on arrival at Couville, France, as brutal. “The four Irish trucks would be carrying about 1,200 calves and when they arrive, they’re desperate for milk. The workers get impatient because they won’t leave the feeders. Calves were kicked and whacked repeatedly, particularly around the head with sticks. We saw one collapse, either because of the brutality or because of exhaustion and hunger. Or both.” A year ago the two groups covered calf mistreatment at another Cherbourg feeding facility, Qualivia. Moffat said the incidents could not be dismissed as isolated.  The groups also argued that the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted dairy industry weaknesses. “The continuing export of Irish dairy calves is a welfare nightmare. It breaks a range of EU laws and increases the risk of infections and diseases being transferred from one country to another. There is no automatic quarantine for truckers. On this trip the drivers moved from Rosslare to France through Belgium, up to Holland, and then they go home,” said Moffat. In a statement, L214 described the transport of calves as “an ordeal” in normal times, and, during the Covid-19 pandemic, “totally irresponsible”. They called on the EU and the French agriculture ministry to “urgently stop” veal transports. A lawyer for another welfare organisation, currently preparing a court case that could end unweaned calf exports from Scotland and possibly the rest of the EU, agreed about the welfare and disease risks. “This is why we’re asking the Scottish courts to declare it unlawful to allow unweaned calves to be exported. If we win our case, it will hopefully have repercussions throughout the EU,” said Peter Stevenson of Compassion in World Farming. Stevenson said he was shocked to see the Scottish and UK governments preparing to defend calf exports by appointing Queen’s Counsel barristers. He said the UK government and Boris Johnson, had “both said they want to end live exports”, making their defence “hypocritical”. Contacted by the Guardian, the director of the feeding facility where the calf mistreatment was filmed, said the mistreatment allegedly shown in the video was “not possible” but refused to comment further. A person who answered the Qualivia mobile number refused to identify themselves and said they had no further comment on the video of calf mistreatment filmed last year. Ireland’s Department of Food, Agriculture and the Marine emailed a statement saying it “continues to undertake inspection/control activities and provide certification to the farming and food sectors, whilst respecting HSE [the Irish health service] public health guidance with regard to hygienic and social distancing protocols.” The statement also said that if “there is evidence of alleged non-compliances at a premises in France, anyone with such evidence should bring the matter immediately to the attention of the authorities there, who can investigate/respond as necessary”. At the time of publication, the French agriculture ministry had not responded to requests for comment."
"Michael Davoren shudders when he thinks of the 1990s. He’d been in charge of his 80-hectare farm in the Burren, Co Clare, since the 1970s, and the place was in his blood. The Davorens had worked these hills for 400 years. But growing intensification fuelled by European subsidies meant that most farmers in this part of Ireland were having to decide between getting big or getting out. Hundreds were choosing the latter. Davoren followed the advice to specialise and chase the beef markets. “The more animals I kept, the more money I got,” he says. “I put more cattle out, bought fertiliser, made silage. Slurry run-off was killing fish. But if I kept fewer animals I’d be penalised 10% of my subsidy.” The austere appearance of the Burren landscape belies its rich diversity. The thick rocks were laid down 300 million years ago when warm tropical seas covered the area, and the bodies of billions of marine creatures cascaded to the sea floor to form the Burren limestone. These limestone cracks are usually jammed with life. In late spring, the grey slabs are transformed into an explosion of colour as lipstick-red orchids and deep blue gentians bloom. Hovering above them, ready to feed, should be an abundance of insects. But by the 1990s the rocky uplands, which had been farmed for 6,000 years, had been abandoned in favour of lowland fields which were now glossy with nitrogen fertiliser. The farms were clean and green, but where had the species-rich habitats gone? “Everyone thought the best thing for the Burren was to close the gates, get rid of the farmers and let nature look after itself,” says Davoren. Brendan Dunford, a young ecologist, arrived in 1999 to do research for his PhD on farming. He soon recognised the changes that were exerting negative pressures on the landscape. Resilient breeds were being replaced with larger continental cattle with feed demands greater than the land could provide. Cattle slurry was seeping into underground streams causing water pollution. “It was economically successful for farmers. They were grant-aided to turn ‘bad’ land into ‘good’,” says Dunford. “They were trying to make a living. It was a big moment for me – I figured that unless I came back with a better financial proposition, with the conviction that this is the right thing to do, then I was at nothing.” Dunford needed to radically rethink what it means to be a farmer. “What defined farmers was how much food they can produce. The biggest challenge was to get them to take on a new role – to convince them they have a broader destiny than just food. And for that, they needed to be supported and paid to do it.” He established a pioneering scheme, funded by the EU’s environment directorate, that pays farmers for nature-filled fields and clean waterways. He’s been at the vanguard of the once radical idea of “public money for public goods”. Instead of giving farmers money for the amount of land they own, or the quantity of food they produce, they are rewarded for producing healthy, diverse fields. Dunford steered clear of paying farmers for taking actions regardless of their impacts – the standard way that farm subsidies are doled out. Instead, he took inspiration from “results-based” agri-environment schemes that had been trialled in Canada and the UK in the 1980s. Farmers would be paid if their practices resulted in positive environmental outcomes. It’s an approach that acknowledges what farmers know, but large-scale agricultural policies ignore: every field is different. Their lands are scored on a scale of zero to 10; healthier, nature-filled fields score higher and attract larger payments. Fifteen years on, with 328 farmers signed up, the Burren has been reshaped. Dunford’s project has reinvigorated the close relationship between farmers and their hilly fields. Farmers have rejuvenated an ancient tradition called “winterage”, where cattle spend the cold months on the uplands. They graze down the tough, hardy grasses which provides space for rare flowers in spring; here the limestone slabs act as giant hot-water bottles, slowly dissipating the summer heat stored in the rocks. It has transformed parts of the uplands into species-rich calcareous grasslands, replete with native flowers such as O’Kelly’s spotted orchid, the perennial mountain-avens and the rare lesser twayblade orchid. Life attracts life; each summer, butterflies such as the pearl-bordered fritillary and the brown hairstreak can be seen in the fields, and it’s now not uncommon to hear the distinctive soprano buzz of the shrill carder bee. Recent data by entomologist Dr Dara Stanley, of University College Dublin, shows that higher-scoring fields in the Burren programme have a higher species richness of bumblebees. “What they’re doing in the Burren is working,” she says. The Burren scheme is no panacea. It’s not easy to convince younger generations of farmers to resist the temptations – and salaries – of urban life. Dunford’s current budget to pay them for nature – on average they get about £6,000 a year – isn’t enough to keep them all on the land. Many of Ireland’s cattle end their lives in large-scale feedlots – a growing feature of the country’s industrialised agrifood sector – to be fattened up before slaughter and export, mainly to the UK. But morale among farmers in the Burren is high and their environment is in remarkable shape. This sets it firmly apart from the majority of Irish farmland. Nature in Ireland is facing “acute problems”, says Dr Liam Lysaght, of the National Biodiversity Data Centre, whose scientists predict that a third of all bee species in the country face extinction within the next 10 years. Ireland wrestles with high carbon emissions, ammonia levels and water pollution. It also comes at a crucial time for the £44bn European Common Agricultural Policy. A third of the budget goes to so-called “greening measures”, designed to enhance nature and reduce emissions, but these have been a dismal failure. In March, a group of European scientists called for a radical change to farm subsidies, arguing that the fund must be used to pay farmers for public goods, and that results-based schemes should be part of this reform. Meanwhile, the EU’s new food policy, which was published last month, is rooted in the kind of ecological-based farming systems that Dunford’s model has pioneered. The Burren could serve as a regional template of farming for the future. Public money for public goods is the basis of the UK’s proposed replacement for EU farm subsidies. A report published last October by Natural England said that a pilot results-based project in the Yorkshire Dales was beneficial to wildlife and had enthusiastic buy-in from the farmers. For Michael Davoren, farming today couldn’t be more different from the dark days. “Big ships are difficult to turn around and agriculture is a very big ship. But Brendan Dunford turned it around for us,” he says. “In the past, the environment was a by-product. In the future, the environment is what we’ll be producing, and the food will be a by-product.” Dunford’s guiding philosophy – that we need more farming, not less – overturns the view held by some that the only hope for nature is to erase humans from the picture and leave the land alone. He listened to farmers, and found a way to entice them towards a new destiny: one that is full of life."
"Wildfires in Ukraine have spread to just over a mile from the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant and a disposal site for radioactive waste, according to activists, as more than 300 firefighters work to contain the blaze. A video posted by a Chernobyl tour operator showed flames and a cloud of smoke rising within sight of the protective shelter over the carcass of Chernobyl’s Unit 4 nuclear reactor, the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history. The tour operator, Yaroslav Yemelianenko, wrote that the fire had reached the abandoned city of Pripyat and was just 2km (1.24 miles) away from the nuclear power plant and the Pidlisny radioactive waste disposal site. “The situation is critical. The zone is burning,” he wrote in a Facebook post accompanied by a video of the blaze. Yemelianenko, a member of a public advisory board to Ukraine’s emergency service, also accused the government of covering up the severity of the fires. Ukraine’s emergency service on Monday said the fire was “difficult” but called for calm, saying all radiation levels in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, were normal and urging people not to listen to “apocalyptic messages”. “The main thing we can say is that there is no threat to the nuclear power station, the spent fuel storage, and to other critical sites in the exclusion zone,” the agency said. The agency said 310 firefighters and dozens of fire trucks, as well as three aircraft and three helicopters, had been deployed to extinguish the fire. The agency did not say exactly how far the fire was from the site of the former reactor or other sensitive sites. On Monday, a member of Greenpeace’s Russia branch told Reuters that the fires were larger than Ukraine’s official estimates and could pose a health risk. “A fire approaching a nuclear or hazardous radiation facility is always a risk,” Rashid Alimov, head of energy projects at Greenpeace Russia, told the agency. Fires have been burning since 4 April in Chernobyl’s exclusion zone, the 30-kilometre (18.6-mile) area around the former nuclear reactor where authorities have barred people from living. The fires were a result of locals setting fire to grass, police said. Ukraine’s parliament on Monday raised fines for grass arson to more than £4,500, an 18-fold increase adopted amid considerable public anger over the fires. The fires gained strength over the weekend due to strong winds. “At the moment, we cannot say the fire is contained,” Kateryna Pavlova, the acting head of the agency that oversees the area, told the New York Times on Saturday."
"A white steel pole rises out of the sea off the Caribbean coast of Panama, poking above the waves like the funnel of a sunken steamship. Launched into the water last month, this is no shipwreck, but the base of what will soon become a floating home and, in the eyes of its makers, the first step towards building a brave new post-Covid-19 society, out on the open ocean.“Coronavirus is an opportunity to show the world that what we’re building is actually going to be very useful in the future,” says Chad Elwartowski, in a recent video post from his beachside base in Panama. The Michigan-born software engineer turned bitcoin trader is a leading figure in the seasteading movement, a libertarian group dedicated to building independent floating cities on the high seas. Along with the bunker builders and survivalist preppers, their long-held ambitions have been bolstered by the current global pandemic. “No matter if you’re scared of the virus or the reaction to the virus,” he adds, “living out on the ocean will be helpful for these situations.”It is not the first time Elwartowski has attempted to realise his dream of a floating future. In April last year, he and his Thai partner Supranee Thepdet (aka Nadia Summergirl), were forced to flee their first floating home off the coast of Thailand, just moments before it was raided by the Thai navy. They had constructed what they declared to be “the first seastead” 12 nautical miles from Phuket, but the authorities decided that the six metre-wide fibreglass cabin, perched on top of a floating pole, posed a threat to Thailand’s sovereignty. It was an offence punishable by life imprisonment or even the death penalty. “The couple announced on social media declaring their autonomy beyond the jurisdiction of any courts or law of any countries, including Thailand,” said Rear Admiral Vithanarat Kochaseni, adding that they had invited others to join them. “We see such action as deteriorating Thailand’s independence.” After a few weeks on the run, dodging Thai patrol boats and eventually making their way to Singapore, the couple moved to Panama to relaunch their company, Ocean Builders with the financial backer of the project, Rüdiger Koch, a retired German aerospace engineer. “This event has doubled down our efforts,” the group said in a statement, following the Thai ordeal. “We can all clearly see that seasteading needs to happen now as tyranny creeps ever more deeply into our governments to the point that they are willing to hunt down a couple of residents residing in a floating house in middle of nowhere.”The coronavirus pandemic has given fringe libertarian groups around the world renewed vigour to pursue their dreams of building autonomous new societies. Government-enforced lockdowns and increased digital surveillance have added fuel to their suspicions of state control, while the suspension of day-to-day norms and the spectre of an economic meltdown have amplified their calls to rethink society. “When you’re not sure which virus is more contagious,” says the slogan of a recent meme made by Americans for Liberty, shared on Elwartowski’s Facebook page. “Covid-19, or those fine with complete government control.”The sentiment lies at the core of the seasteading community, a disparate group that has grown since 2008, when the Seasteading Institute was founded in San Francisco by Patri Friedman. The self-styled anarcho-capitalist (and grandson of Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman) was working as a Google software engineer when he managed to attract funding from PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel to set up the institute. In a founding statement, they described its goal as being “to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems”. Thiel was nothing if not confident: “The nature of government is about to change at a very fundamental level,” he proclaimed. Seasteading represents the ultimate Silicon Valley approach to governance, conceiving society as a technology that can be hacked and innovated upon as simply as an operating system. It is predicated on the idea that government regulation stifles innovation, and therefore the route to a better world can only be found by unleashing a new generation of start-up societies that are forced to compete for citizens in a free market of ideologies. Don’t like the rules of your current micro-nation? Simply move to another one. “We will give people the freedom to choose the government they want,” said Friedman, “instead of being stuck with the government they get.” Its boosters see it as the route to salvation; its critics say it would lead to “an apartheid of the worst kind”. Progress has been bumpy. Thiel’s donations soon dried up, and Friedman’s plans never got much further than launching Ephemerisle – a waterborne version of the Burning Man festival, staged in the Sacramento River delta near San Francisco, where rival floating pontoons compete for the attention of soggy partygoers. He has since moved his focus away from the water, recently launching a company to develop experimental cities on dry land instead. But the Seasteading Institute continues without him, headed by author and self-appointed “seavangelist”, Joe Quirk.“Nearly half of the world’s surface is unclaimed,” says Quirk, who published a book on seasteading in 2017, with the ambitious subtitle: “How floating nations will restore the environment, enrich the poor, cure the sick, and liberate humanity from politicians”. In an introductory video, he describes the planet’s oceans as “a sort of research and development zone where we could discover better means of governance”, and says that seasteading could “provide the technology for thousands of people to start their own nano-nation on the high seas”, giving people “opportunities to peacefully test new ideas about living together”. The most successful seasteads, he says, “will become thriving new societies, inspiring change around the world”. So far, his own attempts don’t bode particularly well for the future of floating utopias. In January 2017, after years of technical feasibility studies and political negotiations, the Seasteading Institute signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of French Polynesia to build the first seasteads in its territorial waters. The designs, developed by Dutch architects Blue21, looked like a high-end resort in the Maldives, depicting a series of villas linked by an undulating green landscape. It was all to be magicked from the waters by an initial coin offering, a form of crowdfunding through selling tokens of a new cryptocurrency, all the rage among the tech community in 2017. “We’re going to draw a new map of the world with French Polynesia at the centre of the aquatic age,” Quirk declared. The choice of location was strategic. Comprised of almost 120 dispersed low-lying islands and atolls, French Polynesia is at severe risk of suffering devastating consequences from even the slightest rise in sea level. It also happens to boast the world’s largest exclusive economic zone, an area of sea that can stretch for 200 nautical miles from a territory’s coastline, over which it can claim exclusive economic rights. At five million square kilometres, French Polynesian waters span an area as large as the landmass of the entire European Union, making it an ideal place to experiment with novel forms of aquatic jurisdiction. In theory.“We explained to the Polynesians how having a quasi-autonomous area nearby was a good thing,” says Tom W Bell, professor of law at Chapman University in Orange County, California, who drew up the legal agreement for the project. “Look at Monaco, or Hong Kong or Singapore – special jurisdictions create a lot of growth outside their borders.” In his book, Your Next Government? From the Nation State to Stateless Nations, Bell traces the projected evolution of a seastead. It would begin “like a coral polyp”, he writes, protected by a country’s territorial waters, where it would start to generate economic activity, “enriching its environment and attracting still more life”, before breaking free to start a new autonomous life on the open ocean. Ultimately, he imagines seasteads nurtured by different host nations congregating in mid-ocean gyres, sheltered within floating breakwaters. “A new kind of government arises,” he writes, “born in Earth’s last free places, fated to advance the human frontier.” The reality didn’t quite pan out that way in the South Pacific. “There wasn’t a perfect alignment of interests,” says Marc Collins Chen, former minister of tourism of French Polynesia, who co-founded the company Blue Frontiers with Quirk to realise the project. “The government was looking for something to address sea level rise and environmental degradation, whereas the Seasteading Institute was more about autonomy.” He says that the prospect of a tax-free enclave held little appeal for the locals, given that Polynesians don’t pay income tax anyway. One Tahitian TV host compared the situation to the evil Galactic Empire in Star Wars imposing on the innocent Ewoks, while secretly building the Death Star. The libertarian position didn’t help either. As Collins Chen puts it: “It’s very difficult to ask for government support when your narrative is that you want to get rid of politicians.” In retrospect, Bell agrees: “They already had a beautiful paradise in French Polynesia. The local community wasn’t very enthusiastic about the project, and I get it. They didn’t need strangers coming in and ruining their view.” Collins Chen has since moved to New York, where he has established a new company to develop further plans for floating cities, this time stripped of any libertarian tax-dodging ideology. “I realised that the real future for these sorts of projects has to be closer to cities,” he says. “They have to be an extension of an existing city’s infrastructure, they need to be run by the mayor, and they have to pay their taxes – as opposed to being enclaves for the wealthy.”His plan, titled Oceanix City, has been designed in slick Ted Talk style by Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect beloved of Silicon Valley tech companies. His twinkling animations depict a floating world of interlocking hexagonal islands, where power is harvested from waves and the sun, where residents live on a diet of seaweed and fish, and where marine life is “regenerated” by artificial reefs. “If this floating city flourishes,” said Ingels in a presentation, “it can then grow like a culture in a petri dish.” On a screen behind him, the floating hexagons multiplied until they took up an area more than three times the size of Manhattan, a vision of low-density suburbia sprawling virulently across the sea.“Over the next 40 years, the world is expected to build 230bn square metres in new construction,” says Collins Chen, “the equivalent of adding one New York City every month. This could be a way to accommodate that growth, without the devastating effects of land reclamation or deforestation.” He says part of the appeal is the ability to reconfigure the urban form according to changing needs, in a process of drag-and-drop city building. “You could literally float one a city block away and put a different one in its place, when the need for a new school, hospital or university arose.” Remarkably, their sci-fi scheme has won the support of the United Nations’ sustainable development arm, UN-Habitat, which hosted a round table discussion for the project in April 2019. As global heating accelerates, sea levels rise and more people crowd into urban slums, “floating cities is one of the possible solutions,” said UN-Habitat’s executive director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif.Back in Panama, the notion that floating habitats could be an inclusive solution to global housing need seems a long way off, to put it mildly. Despite the country’s coronavirus lockdown, the Ocean Builders team has been at work throughout, laying the foundations for a factory that will soon house the largest 3D printer in Central America, ready to produce what their website touts as “the world’s first 3D-printed, smart floating home with an underwater room wrapped in an eco restorative 3D-printed coral reef” – yours for between $200,000 to $800,000 (£160,000 to £640,000).“In light of the global pandemic, we’re really focusing on making the homes feel like a kind of lifeboat,” says the company’s CEO, Grant Romundt, who worked on the Freedom Ship project in Florida in the 1990s, an aborted plan to build a mile-long cruise ship for 40,000 people, topped with a runway. “They should be a safe place to escape to and be totally energy independent, with solar panels on the roof, water desalination on board, waste collection by drone, and aeroponic systems to grow your own food.”Designed by Koen Olthuis of Dutch architecture practice Waterstudio, the plans for the luxury “SeaPods” look like a row of gigantic motorbike helmets on poles, sticking up out of the sea in pearlescent shades of blue, green and grey. “We wanted to have something that was very futuristic looking, very clean and flowing,” says Romundt. “I didn’t want to have a 90-degree corner anywhere in the house. I think that’s bad feng shui.” The interiors recall supersized sanitaryware, envisaged as white, wipe-clean worlds of free-flowing surfaces, echoing retro-futuristic visions of streamlined space capsules. The similarity is no accident: for company founder, Rüdiger Koch, seasteading is merely a stepping stone for trialling exploits in space. He has long harboured plans to build a cable “launch loop” to propel payloads into space without rockets, and he sees the ocean as the perfect launchpad. “There are almost only large open spaces at sea,” he told German regional newspaper, Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung, “and you need them to make sure that nothing goes wrong and nobody is hit by possible flying parts.” Romundt insists that the company is merely building floating holiday homes, which will be registered as boats under the Panama flag for legal purposes, and likely operate on a timeshare basis. “That would give you the slow adjustment period,” he says, “then more of an economy would start to build as more people come requiring more services, and it would start to self-perpetuate and grow.”For Bell, the ultimate goal is to see such floating communities raise their own flags in the open ocean. “Right now, a self-flagged seastead would have effectively no status at all in international law,” he says. “The coast guard would show up, assume you were either a pirate or a floating meth lab, and tow you right back in to shore. But if seasteaders can say they have enough people and a big enough territory, and start flagging themselves, that’s when things will start to get interesting.”And if they fail? “That’s the marvellous thing about seasteads,” says Quirk. “If a government fails, there’s nothing much the people who live there can do about it, but if seasteads fail, they simply disassemble and go away” – seeing all those bitcoin dollars sink into the sea just as quickly as they were conjured."
"Hunting, farming and the global move of people to cities has led to massive declines in biodiversity and increased the risk of dangerous viruses like Covid-19 spilling over from animals to humans, a major study has concluded. In a paper that suggests the underlying cause of the present pandemic is likely to be increased human contact with wildlife, scientists from Australia and the US traced which animals were most likely to share pathogens with humans. Taking 142 viruses known to have been transmitted from animals to humans over many years, they matched them to the IUCN’s red list of threatened species. Domesticated animals like cattle, sheep, dogs and goats shared the highest number of viruses with humans, with eight times more animal-borne viruses than wild mammal species. Wild animals that have adapted well to human-dominated environments also share more viruses with people. Rodents, bats and primates – which often live among people, and close to houses and farms – together were implicated as hosts for nearly 75% of all viruses. Bats alone have been linked to diseases like Sars, Nipah, Marburg and Ebola. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that the spillover risk was highest from threatened and endangered wild animals whose populations had declined largely due to hunting, the wildlife trade and loss of habitat. “Human encroachment into biodiverse areas increases the risk of spillover of novel infectious diseases by enabling new contacts between humans and wildlife … We found that species in the primate and bat orders were significantly more likely to harbour zoonotic viruses compared to all other orders,” it said. “Spillover of viruses from animals are a direct result of our actions involving wildlife and their habitat,” said lead author Christine Kreuder Johnson, director of the EpiCenter for Disease Dynamics at the One Health Institute, a programme of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. “The consequence is they’re sharing their viruses with us. These actions simultaneously threaten species survival and increase the risk of spillover. In an unfortunate convergence of many factors, this brings about the kind of mess we’re in now,” she said. “We need to be really attentive to how we interact with wildlife and the activities that bring humans and wildlife together. We obviously don’t want pandemics of this scale. We need to find ways to co-exist safely with wildlife, as they have no shortages of viruses to give us,” said Johnson. Separately, more than 200 of the world’s wildlife groups have written to the World Health Organization (WHO) calling on it to recommend to countries a highly precautionary approach to the multi-billion dollar wildlife trade, and a permanent ban on all live wildlife markets and the use of wildlife in traditional medicine. The Covid-19 pandemic, says the letter, is believed to have originated at wildlife markets in China, and to have been transmitted to humans as a result of the close proximity between wildlife and people. The groups, which include the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Zoological Society of London and Peta, say a ban on wildlife markets globally will help prevent the spread of disease, and address “one of the major drivers of species extinction”. “This decisive action, well within the WHO’s mandate, would be an impactful first step in adopting a highly precautionary approach to wildlife trade that poses a risk to human health,” says the letter. The organisations argue that zoonotic diseases are responsible for over 2 billion cases of human illness and over 2 million human deaths each year, including from Ebola, Mers, HIV, bovine tuberculosis, rabies, and leptospirosis. The letter follows acting UN biodiversity chief Elizabeth Maruma Mrema’s call in the Guardian this week for a global ban on wildlife markets. Unlike the conservation groups, Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, emphasised that millions of people, particularly in Africa, depend on wild animals for food and that alternatives to wet markets are needed. In a growing sign that global organisations are embarrassed by the emergence of zoonotic diseases in traded animals, Cites, the body which regulates the international trade of animals, refused to be drawn into the growing debate about the origins of Covid-19. In a terse statement it said: “Matters regarding zoonotic diseases are outside of Cites’s mandate and the Secretariat does not have the competence to make comments on the recent news on the possible links between human consumption of wild animals and Covid-19.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"A rare hole has opened up in the ozone layer above the Arctic, in what scientists say is the result of unusually low temperatures in the atmosphere above the north pole. The hole, which has been tracked from space and the ground over the past few days, has reached record dimensions, but is not expected to pose any danger to humans unless it moves further south. If it extends further south over populated areas, such as southern Greenland, people would be at increased risk of sunburn. However, on current trends the hole is expected to disappear altogether in a few weeks. Low temperatures in the northern polar regions led to an unusual stable polar vortex, and the presence of ozone-destroying chemicals such as chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere – from human activities – caused the hole to form. “The hole is principally a geophysical curiosity,” said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. “We monitored unusual dynamic conditions, which drive the process of chemical depletion of ozone. [Those dynamics] allowed for lower temperatures and a more stable vortex than usual over the Arctic, which then triggered the formation of polar stratospheric clouds and the catalytic destruction of ozone.” The hole is not related to the Covid-19 shutdowns that have drastically cut air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. It is also too early to say whether the unusually stable Arctic polar vortex conditions are linked with the climate crisis, or part of normal stratospheric weather variability. Peuch said there were no direct implications for the climate crisis. Temperatures in the region are already increasing, slowing the depletion of ozone, and the hole will start to recede as polar air mixes with ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. The last time similar conditions were observed was in spring 2011. The hole was tracked by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, based partly in Reading and funded by the European commission. While a hole over the Arctic is a rare event, the much larger hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic has been a major cause for concern for more than four decades. The production of ozone-depleting chemicals has been drastically reduced, under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, but some sources appear still to be functioning – in 2018, unauthorised emissions were detected from eastern China. The Antarctic ozone hole was the smallest in 35 years last November, showing the success of efforts to cut the production of the harmful pollutants. The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. New sources of ozone-depleting chemicals were not a factor in the hole observed in the Arctic, said Peuch. “However, this is a reminder that one should not take the Montreal Protocol measures for granted, and that observations from the ground and from satellites are pivotal to avoid a situation where the chlorine and bromine levels in the stratosphere could increase again.”"
"Millions of Americans risk losing running water if they fall behind with bill payments in coming months, as mass layoffs triggered by the coronavirus pandemic force families to make impossible tradeoffs on paying household expenses. Around two-fifths of the country rely on water utilities which have not suspended the policy of shutoffs for non-payment, despite public health warnings that good hygiene – specifically frequent hand washing – is crucial to preventing spread of the highly contagious virus, according to data analysed by Food and Water Watch (FWW) and the Guardian. The virus has spread exponentially in the past month with 336,912 confirmed cases in the US as of Sunday, including 9,615 deaths, according to data collated by the New York Times. An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Americans are expected to die from Covid-19 complications, even if mitigation measures like good hygiene and social distancing are fully implemented. “This is an emergency and the priority is to stop the spread so this is a no brainer, everyone must have access to water … this should not be a partisan issue,” said congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, who is pushing federal intervention. In addition to the public health toll, the economic impact of the pandemic is already devastating families, with close to 10 millon people filing for unemployment benefits during the second half of March and an unprecedented spike in demand for emergency aid at food banks. One in two American adults have either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate’s 2019 Financial Security Index. Yet despite the evolving economic and health crises, less than 60% of the population have so far been protected from water shutoffs. And just 11% of these utilities have explicitly pledged to reconnect households currently without running water due to unpaid bills. “As unemployment reaches record highs, millions of Americans are going to have to choose between paying for food, rent and bills … water is not something people should have to tradeoff,” said Mary Grant, director of water at FWW. There is no national database tracking shutoffs or the number of US households left without running water. But in 2016, one in every 20 households were disconnected by public water departments, leaving an estimated 15 million Americans without running water. The highest shutoffs rates were concentrated in southern and rural states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida and Oklahoma. Some of the hardest-hit towns and cities including New Orleans, Detroit, Milwaukee, Mecklenburg, Ada and Dekalb are now Covid-19 hot-spots, according to analysis by the Guardian. In New Orleans, which has the fourth highest rate of coronavirus infection per capita in the country, only 300 households have so far been reconnected and the city does not know how many remain without running water. “It’s a package of related factors – institutional racism, environmental injustice, and poverty – which means communities most vulnerable to Covid-19 are the same communities most vulnerable to water shutoffs,” said Grant. So far, the moratoriums on shutoffs include 12 statewide orders, which apply to private and public water providers, issued by the governors of California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin. On Monday a coalition of community groups were set to call on New York governor Andrew Cuomo to issue a moratorium on price hikes, fines and shutoffs until 180 days after the end of the state of emergency. Currently, 8.5 million stateside New Yorkers still face the threat of disconnection if they fail to keep up with bills, while the number of households without running water is unknown. Shutoffs have been banned in New York City since before the pandemic, but in Buffalo for example, taps were turned off on 17,000 occasions between 2015 and March 2019. Buffalo has suspended shutoffs but is not reconnecting those without running water. Meanwhile, there are signs of some political will to tackle the issue in Washington. The House version of the third rescue package included $1.5bn to assist low income households with water bills during the crisis, and a condition which required localities and utilities to suspend utility shutoffs in order to qualify for financial aid. But the clauses were left out of the final bill approved by the senate on 26 March. Instead, congressional Democrats want $12bn for water subsidies in the fourth rescue package, with grants for utilities conditional on shutoff moratoriums. The National Association of Clean Water Agencies expects the pandemic to cost $12.5bn in lost revenue due to unpaid bills, debt forgiveness and restoring service. Last week, House speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled plans to propose $85bn for water projects in a subsequent forthcoming infrastructure bill to stimulate economic recovery. Almost 28 million people could lose their jobs by May, according to forecasting firm Oxford Economics – more than double the jobs cut during the 2007 to 2009 recession and its aftermath. Congresswoman Lawrence said: “Access to water has not been a priority in this country because it’s been a poor person’s issue ... now it’s a national concern and we have to transform our mindset.”"
"Scottish fishermen are turning to food banks and welfare organisations, as the coronavirus crisis has led to plummeting demand for seafood, leaving many unable to work to feed their families. Worst-hit are lobster and crab fishermen in Scotland’s south-east and west coasts, according to the Fishermen’s Mission, a Christian welfare charity. Staff at the charity have also identified “pockets of need” in Shetland and as far south as Newlyn in Cornwall. This comes just before the Easter holiday, traditionally a period of increased demand. Claire McIntosh, the Mission’s area official for south-east Scotland, has been working 12-hour days fielding calls from crews whose skippers have had to tie up their boats. “I’ve been liaising with food banks since January,” said McIntosh, whose patch covers the 80 miles of coastline from Seahouses in Northumberland to Port Seton in East Lothian. “This is on the back of poor weather and poor catches during winter. They are very self-sufficient folk, very resilient, resourceful and hard-working. Their last resort is to come to us. But I’ve handed out £17,500 in the last few weeks, compared to £12,000 for the whole of the last year.” The UK fishing industry is worth £989m annually, with Scottish vessels responsible for more than half, at £574m in 2018. More than 70% of its catch is exported, mainly to Europe and Asia, but foreign and hospitality markets have collapsed in the crisis. While a much smaller retail market still exists for some fish, many supermarkets have shut their fish counters, reducing demand further. For high-value shellfish, the market is now virtually nonexistent. “Langoustine, shrimp and prawn are almost impossible to get rid of and the demand for crab and lobster in China has just vaporised,” said David Dickens, the Mission’s chief executive. “When there’s a pandemic, people aren’t interested in high quality seafood.” The charity’s 71 staff across the UK are expecting things to get worse. “All the indications are we’re at the beginning of a curve of need,” said Dickens. “This is the calm before the storm. From Kirkcudbright in the south up as far as Mallaig, there’s a lot of very worried people. We’re planning for the worst, but hoping for the best. Our focus is keeping the lights on and keeping food on the table.” On 25 March, the Scottish government announced a £5m assistance package aimed at 650 seafood companies impacted by the collapse in the market for shellfish, and for owners of full-time registered vessels under 12 metres. Dickens welcomes the scheme, which is underway, but said he and his staff are supporting crew or skippers who are ineligible, including those working part time. A further £10m package for fish processing businesses was announced by the Scottish government on 3 April. A spokesperson said: “Work on the grant to processors is ongoing and we hope to open applications soon.” They added that further support is being made available, including a £2.2bn grant to help Scottish businesses pay staff and treat them fairly. Donna Fordyce, the interim head of trade marketing body Seafood Scotland, which is working on exploring other alternatives to get Scotland’s seafood to consumers, said: “It’s a pretty grim picture across the board. The seafood sector has been one of the hardest hit of all the sectors in Scotland, because of the level of exports. The market has more or less collapsed in Europe.” It was already a bad year for fishermen, she said, with the “worst weather we’ve seen for 15 years for fleets”, before the Covid-19 crisis hit. “The prawn and the scallop fleet are more or less all tied up,” said Fordyce. “The whitefish fleet, some are still going out. “It is going to be a UK market for the next few months.” Scotland has 2,089 registered vessels and 4,860 crew.  Among those waiting to find out if they are eligible for the £10m fund for processors is Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Langoustines and Loch Fyne Seafarms. McMillan, who employs 22 staff directly and a further 48 on vessels, was forced to close temporarily three weeks ago because of the pandemic. “We are waiting with bated breath,” said McMillan, who processes and exports scallops, lobsters and crabs. “If we can’t get that or we are not eligible, we’re finished.” McMillan is currently paying his staff 80% of their salary, under the coronavirus retention scheme, which he can claim back from the government. But he lost 44% of sales to Hong Kong and China when Covid-19 first hit there, and has been losing money since January. “We are having to pay staff weekly. It’s a huge strain on the business as we haven’t any cash.” Based in Tarbert, Argyll and Bute, which has a population of 1,500, McMillan is one of the village’s largest employers. “Twenty-two jobs is a lot of families,” McMillan said. “The whole fishing industry is going to look different when we come out of this. Our customers in Hong Kong are saying 50% of their restaurants have not survived.” Selling direct to the public, a tactic used by some shellfish fishermen in Devon and Cornwall, is more challenging in remote communities in Scotland, he said. “Everyone is trying to sell to the general public but for us it’s very precarious. Businesses like ours depend on volume. I see people in Cornwall doing that. But when you live remotely as we do, there is just not the demand.”"
"Just a few months ago Cheng Yongcai ran a thriving farm that produced 20,000 bamboo rats a year in Qingyuan in northern Guangdong province. It was an operation that his local government actively encouraged with loans and other support, he says. But the Covid-19 outbreak, widely suspected of originating in China’s huge wildlife industry supply chain, has led to a complete halt in Yongcai’s operation, now shut indefinitely while he awaits final rules on what will be allowed once the crisis is over. China put in place a temporary ban on all wildlife trading and consumption in late February. But a final determination as to what will be legal or illegal after years of lacklustre regulation has been postponed until authorities in Beijing can get a handle on the human side of the outbreak. “We still haven’t been told what to do, except that we can’t sell or release or even cull them until further notice, so we’re still keeping them, and that’s been costing us about 300 yuan [£34] per day for the past three months,” Yongcai, 30, told the Guardian by phone. “We hope to transition to other types of business but until it’s clear what to do with the rats, it’s easier said than done,” he said. “We would need funding and the right facility for that.” Like Yongcai, many other wildlife farmers are increasingly irked by the bans on the trade, in place since late January. They argue that they are being unfairly blamed when no evidence has been provided by the Chinese government pinpointing the exact source of the outbreak. Certain types of bats and pangolins have been identified by epidemiological studies as natural carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 viruses that spawned Covid-19. But it is still unclear how likely either of these are to have been the source. Meanwhile, other animals such as civet cats, bamboo rats and several kinds of rodents have been shown to be carriers of coronaviruses. The problem is that the regulation and oversight of the sector has been confusing. The last updated catalogue of terrestrial wildlife approved for breeding by Chinese authorities that the Guardian could find, which appears to be dated 2008, includes civet cats. But it does not include pangolins, bats, or bamboo rats. Yet, local governments, the state forestry and grassland administration and their provincial bureaus have encouraged and supported all sorts of wildlife farms. “The real number could be hundreds or even over a thousand kinds [of wild animal species] with no regulation,” said Yin Shanchuan, a volunteer with the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation who has long been involved in investigations with the group. “Somehow these were still allowed by the forestry authorities,” Yin said. Recently, the industry association that lobbies for farming bamboo rats has called for the government to continue allowing the animals to be bred, arguing that they have been encouraged for years and have not been found to be the source of the Covid-19 outbreak. The group declined to comment about its appeal to lift the ban when contacted by the Guardian on 3 April. “Of course, it’s a bit unfair, because for people in the rural areas, this is a very profitable business,” Yongcai said. “You don’t need to invest a lot, you don’t cause much pollution and you only have to feed them bamboo and grass.” Gao Guanxing, a farmer in a village near Heyuan, Guangdong, was one of thousands who went into wildlife breeding in recent years as part of China’s efforts to alleviate poverty by the end of 2020. In 2016 he started to rear bamboo rats, and he was among farmers feted by officials from nearby Shenzhen and the local government. But now those same local officials are attempting to persuade 230 families who went into breeding bamboo rats, wild boar, snakes, civet cats, frogs and Sika deer to turn to other forms of commerce: brewing, raising chickens, digging fish ponds, with compensation available of up to £23,000 per operation. Guanxing has been encouraged to go into mushroom farming. “After the two old bamboo rat houses are cleaned and disinfected, they will become a three-dimensional mushroom farm,” he told state-run financial newspaper Yicai, adding that once his mushrooms are planted and growing he’ll be able to produce 50kg per day. Attempts to reach Guanxing directly were not successful. Yongcai is in a more difficult position as his farm wasn’t officially part of a poverty alleviation programme, so it is uncertain whether he’ll qualify for compensation or additional assistance to switch to another form of production. “We’ve heard how the Heyuan government is helping breeders there to take up other business such as growing mushrooms and raising chickens, but that’s just for the impoverished household breeders,” Yongcai said. “For regular breeders, we’re still on our own and awaiting a decision.” What is unknown is what will happen once the government finally decides how to regulate the wildlife industry. Officials have discussed moving certain forms of wildlife that are not endangered or protected, nor known potential sources of zoonotic disease, to a list that would allow them to be bred under rules usually meant for poultry and livestock. No comprehensive list for those changes has been released. Theoretically, these rules from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs would provide for safer operations, with those continuing in the business required to have larger-scale operations and biosecurity measures to prevent disease transfer. Yet, as has been seen in the outbreaks of African swine fever among China’s pig farms in recent years, which led to the deaths of millions of swine through the disease and culling, even those measures continue to fail to contain the spread of disease. “I am optimistic that bamboo rats won’t be included in the livestock and poultry list,” Aili Kang, Asia director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told the Guardian. “Currently, the law does not use very biological or ecological definitions. Nor do they use a very pure [definitions] from a zoonotic disease kind of component.” As for Yongcai, he understands that animals can carry viruses and disease, and while he previously sanitised his operation once a month, he is now required to do so each week for the rats that remain in limbo. “I don’t think bamboo rats pose that big a threat,” he said. “Plus, there’s no conclusion yet on where the new coronavirus is from.”"
"Thousands of British homes will be paid to use electricity during the day for the first time, as wind and solar projects produce a surge in clean energy during the coronavirus lockdown. On Sunday morning, windfarms contributed almost 40% of the UK’s electricity, while solar power made up almost a fifth of the power system. Fossil fuels made up less than 15% of electricity, of which only 1.1% came from coal plants. Meanwhile, the country’s energy demand has fallen by around 10% due to the shutdown of pubs, restaurants, companies and factories across the country, leading to the lowest electricity market prices in 10 years. Households on a new breed of home energy tariff will even be paid to use electricity during the day on Sunday, because sunny weather and a brisk breeze will help generate ample clean electricity to meet the UK’s lower energy needs. The so-called “negative electricity prices” have previously only been available to homes overnight, when demand is typically at its lowest. But the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and the bright spring weather mean some homes will be able to earn money while using clean electricity during the day for the first time. Households which use the Agile Octopus energy tariff, offered by Octopus Energy, were contacted on Saturday to let them know they would be paid for every kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity they use during the sunniest hours of Sunday afternoon. From 11am-4pm, those customers will earn 0.22p-3.3p per kWh to make use of the UK’s abundant clean energy, the company said. The coronavirus has caused the UK’s demand for electricity to fall by between 9% and 13% so far, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight. While home energy use is higher because people are self-isolating and working from home, the lockdown has led to a lower demand for electricity across the country due to the shutdown of “large electrical loads” such as factories, shops and railways. Energy bill savings are also likely for homes using variable energy tariffs, which track the wholesale energy markets. A slump in global gas market prices over the last year, combined with the lockdown, caused the wholesale price of electricity on the UK power markets to fall to £28 per megawatt hour (MWh) last week. The electricity market price is down a third from January this year and well below the £44/MWh price recorded this time last year."
"Public sector caterers serving billions of meals a year in schools, universities, hospitals and care homes have pledged to cut the amount of meat they serve by 20%. The caterers’ meals are eaten by a quarter of the UK population and the groups said their action was aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving the healthiness of meals. Industry experts called the move unprecedented. People in rich nations, such as Britain, eat more meat than is considered to be healthy. Studies have also shown that meat consumption must be slashed to tackle the climate emergency and other environmental crises such as water pollution arising from the high impact of livestock. International studies have suggested cuts of up to 90% are needed, but in January the UK’s official climate change advisers recommended a 20% consumption reduction. The #20percentlessmeat pledge was launched in the trade magazine Public Sector Catering. David Foad, editor-in-chief of the magazine, said: “It represents a bold move, because it is not being mandated. It would have been much easier to sit back and wait until they were either prompted or forced into action like this by government.” Some experts have suggested meat taxes are needed to bring about change. Foad said that attaining the 20% target would remove 9m kg of meat from plates every year, equivalent to 45,000 cows or 16 million chickens. Andy Jones, who chairs the PSC100 group of caterers and suppliers working to improve the health of meals, and is also a former chair of the Hospital Caterers Association (HCA), said: “The carbon emissions savings and the potential benefit to people’s health can play a part in tackling climate change and shortening NHS queues.” The HCA has signed up to the pledge. Craig Smith, the association’s chair, told Public Sector Catering that the people it served were already moving away from meat. “The biggest rise we are seeing is those demanding a more plant-based diet.” Matt White, chair of the University Caterers Organisation, said: “[We are] fully committed to the #20percentlessmeat initiative. We have a very short window of opportunity to make changes in the way we all eat or we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and to future generations.” The National Association of Care Catering has also backed the move, but its chair, Sue Cawthray, said it would require work to implement. “I would say our biggest challenge to meeting the 20% target is the mindset of many of those currently in care homes. The majority would have been brought up on a staple diet of meat and veg and will be resistant to change.” Stephen Forster, chair of LACA, (the Local Authority Caterers Association), which represents 3,300 school food providers, said: “The school food industry is leading the way on meat reduction. Schools across the country have meat-free days and are increasingly introducing plant-based vegetarian and vegan options. We therefore support the campaign.” Philip Mansbridge, director at the campaign group ProVeg UK, said: “Never has the public sector made a commitment of this magnitude. By making simple and effective adaptations, all public sector caterers will soon find more of their meals are healthier, more planet-friendly and equally or more delicious.” Jones said: “The huge range of people we feed every day means we can influence the diet of the nation. I, for one, don’t want to be known as part of the generation that could have acted, even in a small way, but did nothing.”"
"More than 35,000 badgers were killed during last year’s cull, according to long overdue figures slipped out by the government on Friday at the height of the coronavirus crisis. The total has dismayed animal rights campaigners, who claim that for the first time since the cull was introduced in 2013, more badgers were shot last year than cattle were slaughtered because they have bovine-TB. Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: “The government licensed the killing of 35,034 badgers in 2019 in 40 culling zones stretching from Cornwall to Cumbria in the largest destruction of a protected species in living memory.” More than 70% of the badgers (24,645) were killed as a result of controlled shooting. “This is a method of killing which is condemned by the British Veterinary Association as inhumane as it can result in badgers taking more than five minutes to die from multiple bullet wounds, blood loss and organ failure,” Dyer said. Only 149 (0.6%) of the total 35,034 badgers killed were monitored to establish that they were dispatched humanely. The total number of badgers killed since the cull policy started now stands at 102,349. It has been estimated that the cull has cost the taxpayer more than £60m. The figures were supposed to have been published months ago but were delayed as the efficacy of the government’s policy came in for criticism. “Badgers are now being slaughtered at such a rate across England that they could face local extinction in areas of the country which they have inhabited since the Ice Age,” Dyer said. “Despite this mass destruction of a protected species, the government has failed to produce any reliable evidence to prove that the culling of badgers is making any significant impact on lowering bovine-TB in cattle in or around the cull zones.” In response to an independent review into its TB policy, the government recently acknowledged that the mass slaughter of badgers was not a long-term solution to reducing bovine-TB. Instead there is to be a new emphasis on vaccinating cattle against the disease. But farmers insist a cull is necessary. The National Farmers Union has expressed frustration that culling and badger vaccination are being given a “false equivalence”. The NFU said vaccination had never been demonstrated to reduce bovine-TB with the same efficacy as culling. Following the change in government policy, the NFU deputy president, Stuart Roberts, said: “In areas where TB in badgers is endemic, we must retain culling as a vital tool enabling industry to get on top of the disease quickly and reduce further transmission.” A Defra spokesperson said: “Bovine TB leads to the slaughter of over 30,000 cattle every year and considerable trauma for farmers as they suffer the loss of highly prized animals and valued herds. As independent research has shown, the badger cull has led to a significant reduction in the disease but no one wants to continue the cull of this protected species forever. We recently set out the next phase of our strategy to combat bTB, which includes field trials of a cattle vaccine, plans to vaccinate more badgers against the disease and improved testing to intercept bTB earlier.”"
"A new national wildlife charity called Heal Rewilding is planning to buy ecologically depleted land across Britain and give it back to nature. The charity, which launches on Monday, is crowdfunding and will seek former farms, green belt or lower-grade land where wildlife can recover. The sites will be within easy reach of large towns and cities to benefit more people. Heal intends to let the land recover naturally rather than by planting nursery-grown trees. The charity’s chair, Jan Stannard, said the launch followed two years of research and would go ahead despite the coronavirus crisis and any related economic hardship, insisting there was no time to delay in tackling the UK’s continuing wildlife declines. “We face a brutal environment, but we are resilient,” she said. “Nature cannot wait. Everywhere I look, I see absence of wildlife. But each one of our sites will help hundreds of species.” The initial £7m, 500-acre project will be in the southern English lowlands on a site yet to be announced, avoiding wildlife-rich land. The site will grow wild from its seed bank, animal seed dispersal or by spreading seeds from nearby land. Similar to the Knepp estate in West Sussex, Heal will reintroduce semi-wild grazers such as pigs, ponies, longhorn cattle and deer to sustain a mosaic of grassland, scrub, wooded areas and possibly wetland zones that will together support a richer mix of species. They will also provide education and accommodation. “We urgently need everyone together to help make nature’s recovery happen,” said Stannard. “Our sites will be places where wildlife can return and thrive, but they will also become sanctuaries for people. Our vision is to heal the land, heal nature and heal ourselves.’’ Their aim fits in with the government’s Nature Recovery Network, a pledge to support thousands more acres of land becoming wildlife reservoirs. There has been a surge in public interest in wildlife habitat creation in recent months. The RSPB’s director for conservation, Martin Harper, welcomed Heal’s plan: “With 15% of UK species at threat of extinction, our incredible wildlife needs all the help it can get. Nature habitats provide amazing benefits for people too.” However a National Farmers’ Union spokesperson questioned where enough spare land could be found: “Rewilding vast tracts of British farmland would mean reducing UK food production and importing food from other parts of the world, potentially produced to standards that would be illegal to produce here in the UK. Any broad scale changes to farmland in the UK need to be properly thought through.” The Friends of the Earth trees campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “A wilder green belt filled with trees, scrub, and wildlife is precisely what the UK needs. It would reconnect more city-dwellers with nature and help fix the climate and ecological emergencies. “Rewilding is an inspirational idea, but risks becoming pigeon-holed as something only wealthy landowners in remote locations can afford. It’s great that new organisations are springing up to show we can also bring nature back to our doorsteps, using crowdfunding to tap into public enthusiasm for restoring lost species.”"
"The nationwide shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak has led to big drops in air pollution across the UK’s major cities, new data analysis shows. Levels of toxic pollutants were likely to fall even further, scientists said, as traffic remained off the roads but prevailing westerly winds from the Atlantic returned. Current easterly winds are bringing additional pollution from continental Europe to Britain. The data shows drops in tiny particle pollution of a third to a half in London, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, falls of about quarter in Manchester, York and Belfast, with smaller declines in Glasgow and Newcastle. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution, the data also shows declines of a third to a half in London, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, and drops of 10-20% in the other cities. Air quality improvements have been seen in nations around the world from Italy to China, as much transport and industry has ground to a halt. Public health experts have warned that the health damage inflicted on people by longstanding air pollution is likely to increase the death rate from Covid-19. “The air is definitely much healthier,” said Prof James Lee at York University and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, who analysed the data. “[Tiny particles and NO2] are the two air pollutants that have the biggest health impacts on people.” “These are big changes – pollution levels are the equivalent at the moment of a holiday, say an Easter Sunday,” he said. “And I think we will see an even starker drop off when the weather changes.” The data comes from background air monitoring stations in cities, sited away from main roads. “We chose these because that is where people live,” said Lee. The average pollution levels for the six-week period before the onset of coronavirus outbreak around the 10 February were compared with the six weeks after. Lee also compared the period after the outbreak with the average of the same period over the last five years. Both comparisons showed large cuts in pollution. The analysis is preliminary as full calibration of the data takes time, but Lee said it was very clear there had been a significant fall in pollution. The biggest factor is the reduction in road traffic, as other contributors such as gas power station operations, heating for buildings and emissions from farms are unlikely to have changed overall. One pollutant – ozone – has risen. This is because chemical interactions in the air normally result in NO2 and small particles reducing ozone levels. So as they have fallen, ozone has risen. But Lee said: “The ozone increases are small, and it usually doesn’t become a problem until the summer months anyway.” Some scientists have suggested that the number of early deaths avoided due to cleaner air might potentially outnumber the deaths from coronavirus. “It is going to be a very interesting epidemiological study, but they take years to do,” said Lee. He said analysis would be difficult because the health impact of the coronavirus was fast, while that of air pollution was slower, and because older people were most at risk from both factors. “There is no silver lining to the Covid-19 situation,” he said. “But I think it shows we can actually achieve quite a lot without travelling. It shows that if we did work from home more in normal times then we would have an effect on air pollution.” Levels of NO2 in most urban areas of the UK have been illegally high since 2010 and many areas have levels of small particles above the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. This pollution is estimated to cause about 110 premature deaths every day."
"Nearly 100 critically endangered sea turtles have hatched on a deserted beach in Brazil, their first steps going almost unnoticed because of coronavirus restrictions that prohibit people from gathering on the region’s sands. The 97 hawksbill sea turtles, or tartarugas-de-pente as they are known in Brazil, hatched last Sunday in Paulista, a town in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco. Photographs taken by government workers, the only people to witness the event, showed the tiny creatures making their way down the beach and into the Atlantic waves. Locals have been forbidden from gathering on Pernambuco’s spectacular shoreline since last weekend, when the state governor, Paulo Câmara, ordered a partial shutdown and urged residents to stay indoors to slow the spread of coronavirus. Speaking to the Guardian last week, Câmara said such measures – which the country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has actively undermined – were vital if Brazil were to avoid a crisis similar to the one that has taken hold in Europe. “Only isolation will stop the curve growing at the speed it is growing in other places,” he said. Câmara said the government of Pernambuco, which has so far confirmed 68 Covid-19 cases and five deaths, was racing against time to make hospital beds available for patients. “All of our efforts are now geared towards delaying its profileration … [so that] when this curve grows, and it will grow, we are as ready as we possibly can be to care for people,” he said. According to Brazil’s Tamar conservation project, which protects sea turtles, hawksbills lay their eggs along the country’s north-eastern coast and are considered a critically endangered species. They can grow up to 110cm in length, weigh 85kg and owe their Portuguese name, which translates as “comb turtles”, to the fact that their shells were once widely used to make combs and frames for glasses. The turtle’s English name comes from its narrow, pointed beak, according to the WWF. Paulista’s environmental secretary, Roberto Couto, said the town was home to four of the five types of turtle found along Brazil’s coastline: the hawksbill, the green sea turtle, the olive ridley turtle and the loggerhead turtle. More than 300 turtles have hatched there this year. Couto said the animals normally lay their eggs from January each year and that the hatchlings emerge in April or May. “It’s really beautiful because you can see the exact instant they come out of the eggs and … watch their little march across the beach,” Couto said. “It’s marvellous. It’s a wonderful, extraordinary feeling. “This time, because of coronavirus, we couldn’t even tell people it was happening.” Câmara said he hoped the coronavirus restrictions could eventually be relaxed in his state, which is home to about nine million of Brazil’s 209 million citizens. But for now, they are essential. “Brazil isn’t ready for an exponential growth [in cases], so we need to buy time … so we can put together the infrastructure to treat as many infected people as possible,” he said."
"Ending native forest logging in Victoria immediately, rather than phasing it out by 2030 as the state government plans, would save taxpayers $192m over the next decade, according to an estimate by the state’s independent budget office. The Victorian Greens asked the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) to calculate what it would cost to shut down the native forest timber industry in the state now, including bringing forward the government’s promised $120m transition package for the industry and workers. The assessment, seen by the Guardian, found there would be an overall $15.3m cost to the budget over the next three years as lost revenue and the cost of the transition package would outweigh savings from no longer paying grants to VicForests, the state-owned timber business. But across the decade it found the money saved from no longer keeping VicForests afloat would be far greater than forestry revenue. The officials calculated it would be expected to improve the state budget position by $191.9m by 2029-2030. Industry representatives and the state Liberal opposition said the PBO analysis was flawed as it did not include the cost of breaking timber supply contracts or redundancy packages for VicForests staff. They said it also did not consider the flow-on economic importance of VicForests’ funding for timber industries, particularly in regional communities, where thousands of jobs were at risk. The Victorian Greens’ environment spokeswoman, Ellen Sandell, said the PBO assessment was independent and showed the “huge cost to the public of destructive logging”. She said the money saved by stopping logging could be spent helping regional economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Sandell said given the devastating summer bushfires had pushed many animals and plants towards extinction, it was “criminal” the federal and state governments last week signed a 10-year extension to the regional forestry agreements covering logging in the state. “Ending native forest logging now, rather than in 10 years, will help both the environment and the economy,” she said. Victoria’s agriculture minister, Jaclyn Symes, said ending logging immediately would put “thousands” out of work before jobs were available in other forms of forest product manufacturing. She said the government’s policy would help businesses and workers move into jobs based on plantation timber as it became available later in the decade. The PBO analysis was commissioned after the premier, Dan Andrews, announced in November that the native forestry industry would be phased out over the next decade, starting with the immediate protection of 90,000 hectares of old-growth forest and 96,000 hectares of native forest set aside to save the threatened greater glider. Andrews warned the native timber supply was already down about 50% in a decade, and that a large bushfire such as that experienced over the summer that followed might hasten the industry’s end, but said forest supply agreements would be extended to 2024, when the $120m package would start rolling out. Bushfires burned at least 1.4m hectares in Victoria over summer. According to government assessments, they affected about 70% of the state’s remaining warm temperate rainforest and more than half the habitat of at least 170 rare and threatened species. The extent of the damage prompted calls for more forest to be protected from logging to give at-risk species a better chance of survival. The government plan was based in part on its expectation an extra 50,000 hectares of plantation forest would become available by 2030. Part of the industry package is earmarked to help mills invest in new equipment to process plantation timber. The Victorian Association of Forestry Industries, which opposes ending native forest logging, said the PBO had underestimated the true cost and not taken into account the economic activity that resulted from grants to VicForests. It cited a 2017 Deloitte Access Economics report, commissioned by VicForests, which suggested the industry then supported 2,526 jobs. A University of Canberra analysis for Forests and Wood Products Australia the following year said there were 1,639 primary processing jobs in native forestry and 2,894 in softwood and hardwood plantations. Jonathon Duniam, the Morrison government’s assistant minister for forestry, said the value of the native forestry industry was in the jobs and livelihoods it provided. “Communities and our economy are stronger when people are in work,” he said. Gary Blackwood, the state opposition forestry spokesman, said the PBO’s report was “absolutely flawed in every sense”. He said it did not appear to include the cost to the state of paying out supply contracts to sawmills, harvest and haul businesses and Australian Paper, and did not consider the impact of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity in the state. “By putting out a report like this the Parliamentary Budget Office [has] insulted every hard-working timber family in Victoria,” Blackwood said.

"The Trump administration has said it will not tighten rules for soot pollution, despite research showing that doing so could save thousands of lives each year. The fine particles, which come from the burning of coal, oil and wood, penetrate the respiratory system and are linked with heart and lung diseases, higher rates of asthma, bronchitis and cancer. Under the current standard, which was set in 2012, polluters can emit enough soot to measure 12 micrograms per cubic meter. Strengthening the standards to 11 micrograms could save about 12,000 lives per year, according to one Harvard study of US seniors. Other research, noted in the government’s own analysis, found that maintaining the soot standard at its current level could allow as many as 52,000 deaths a year in just 47 urban areas. The Environmental Protection Agency is now proposing to to freeze the standards. The move comes as experts warn the coronavirus pandemic is unequally devastating communities of color that have been disproportionately burdened by pollution. It also follows the announcement of laxer fuel-efficiency rules for cars and other efforts by Trump to advance his political agenda before the November election. The agency is also retaining its current standard for coarse particle pollution. The EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler on a call with reporters argued that the agency’s science review “identified a number of uncertainties” and based on those believes that “the current standard remains protective and does not need to be changed.” Rachel Fullmer, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund, said: “the administration’s effort to rush this action, without considering public input, is just the latest in a long line of attempts to ignore and undermine the science-based assessment required when [the government] establishes national standards.” The US government is required to consider new science in evaluating whether air pollution rules are strong enough every five years. Wheeler disbanded the 26-member expert panel meant to review that research, appointing a smaller committee with less specific expertise in the pollutant to provide advice to the agency. Wheeler populated the committee with scientists from state-level agencies and industry – arguing they had long been underrepresented. EPA career staff have raised questions about whether the soot standard is protective enough, conflicting with the independent panel."
"Attacks and calls to ban “wet markets” because of their potential for spreading diseases such as Covid-19 may be missing the point, say experts. Earlier this week Sir Paul McCartney, a long-time vegetarian campaigner, called wet markets “medieval” and said that it made sense to ban them. “When you’ve got the obscenity of some of the stuff that’s going on there and what comes out of it, they might as well be letting off atomic bombs. It’s affecting the whole world.” Last week more than 60 US lawmakers called for a global ban on what are referred to interchangeably as “live wildlife markets” or “wet markets”. And animal welfare groups have also been calling for a ban. According to US lawmakers: “‘Wet’ markets in particular pose a threat to global public health because wildlife comes from many different locations without any standardised sanitary or health inspection processes.” Animal Equality argues that the markets are not only “inhumane” and a source of “intensive suffering inflicted on farmed animals”, but that they are also a “threat to public health”. But experts who know the markets well say that they are just one link in a chain of both legal and illicit wildlife trade that needs intensive regulation, monitoring and enforcement to reduce heath risks, demand and consumption.  In China, much of Asia, and some other parts of the world, a “wet market” is a term used for any market where fresh meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, and other perishable goods, are sold in an open-air setting. The “wet” part comes from sellers sloshing water on produce to keep it cool and fresh. While the markets may be considered unsanitary by western standards, most wet markets in China do not sell live animals other than fish in tanks, or sometimes in open pools. Many markets in China stopped selling live poultry after widespread avian flu outbreaks led provinces and local governments to ban such sales over the past decade. And while it is rare to see wildlife sold in these markets, the practice has continued in poorly regulated sites, such as the now-infamous Wuhan South China Seafood Market, which was suspected to be a primary source for spreading Covid-19 during late 2019. “If we really want to prevent future pandemics, we have to do a lot more than just stop live wildlife being slaughtered at markets or wild meat being sold at markets,” Debbie Banks, head of the tiger campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the Guardian. “In some countries, wildlife is commercially harvested and commercially farmed and transported direct to restaurants, consumed at private banquets, and used in traditional medicine, so there is a need to address demand and other retail venues besides wet markets,” she said. Using terms such as “wet markets” in debates on the issue also risks further stoking misconceptions and cultural prejudices, argue some. “This call for a ban comes from cultural differences often mixed with prejudice,” Kartini Samon, a Jakarta-based campaigner with the nonprofit Grain who has studied wet markets in the region, told the Guardian. “Wet markets are very common and have a long history in many places in Asia.” The Wuhan market was closed on 1 January. Authorities in China placed a temporary ban on all trade in wildlife in late January, including any trade in wildlife to be consumed for meat, to be used in traditional medicine, and for fur and other purposes. Further fine-tuning of the laws and regulations around the trade is ongoing. But it is the regulatory environment that allowed for such trade at the Wuhan market and the networks that supplied it that needs to be addressed, say experts, not simply the existence of the markets themselves. Across many countries wet markets provide an important outlet for small farmers to sell their produce, said Samon. “In a country like India or Indonesia, between 25 and 40 million people rely on wet markets and informal food vendors for their livelihoods.” And while markets like Wuhan’s may be an outlier for their trade in live wildlife, others say that more needs to be done to address general sanitation and hygiene at wet markets. “That means setting standards and sticking to them and having strict enforcement measures against practices that could transmit illness and disease. [That] is more sensible than shutting them down, which won’t be consistently enforceable,” said Dirk Pfeiffer, chair professor at City University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences in Hong Kong. Pfeiffer believes that over time many wet markets will disappear in places like China due to changes in consumer preferences and convenience. Some supermarkets already try to replicate a “mini-wet market” atmosphere with a butcher available under familiar reddish lighting for shoppers to chat with about which cuts are more fresh in a way that is harder to do in larger, impersonal, brightly-lit supermarkets. “I do think that wet markets are an issue when it comes to food safety standards and to adverse environmental impact. But that can be dealt with by regulation and raising awareness among consumers and traders,” Pfeiffer said. “We need to focus on changing the demand, because as long as that is there it will be a way for people to trade in wild animals and their products,” he said."
"People feeling time hang heavy as they struggle with the restrictions of the lockdown may find an unexpected green uplift in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions placed on going outside are fuelling a new online surge in citizen science, as internet users tune into data-crunching projects led by academic researchers. Enforced inactivity for hundreds of millions of people around the world is giving scientists the opportunity to recruit a vast army of online helpers, aiming their collective firepower at some seemingly intractable problems, from the climate crisis to plastic waste, as well as some cute ones - spotting spider monkeys, interpreting baby burblings and snapping blossoms. Unlike some previous citizen science projects, such as the recently paused Search for Extra Terrrestrial Intelligence (Seti) that relied on exploiting the unused computing power of home PCs while their users were offline, this new crop requires people to be alert and often interactive. Instead of searching through outer space, the project leaders invite people to connect with nature and solve environmental problems closer to home. “Citizen science helps scientists and researchers analyse huge data sets which they simply couldn’t manage by themselves, helping to save them hours of time and contributing to scientific breakthroughs,” said Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, which is helping to coordinate some of the UK-based initiatives. “It’s a fantastic way to know you are making a positive difference without even having to leave your own home.” Covid-19 is inevitably one of the most pressing research areas. Despite the efforts of governments and scientists around the world, data on the virus is still patchy, ranging from the very thorough in places such as Iceland, where a high proportion of people have been tested, to the alarmingly opaque, as the spread in many developing countries is likely be taking place without the tracking available in countries with better healthcare. Doctors and researchers at King’s College London and Guys and St Thomas’ hospitals are asking people to fill in data on their symptoms, or lack of them, through an app. The results around the UK are encouraging so far, as there has been a fall in the number of people aged 20-69 recording active symptoms, down to about 1.4 million people, from 1.9 million on 1 April. This is no substitute for proper testing, but will provide scientists with valuable data on the possible incidence and spread of the virus. Fifty years ago, an estimated 20 million people took to the streets in the US and around the world to protest against the rampant destruction of the natural environment, the extinction of species, toxic pollution, and the despoliation of pristine habitats. Earth Day on 22 April 1970 marked the first major demonstration of a new environmentalism that sought to recognise the harm we were doing through untrammelled industrialism. The results of that protest are still being felt, in legislation enacted to safeguard the environment, in the global climate movement and in conservation efforts. But planned demonstrations for the 50th anniversary – aimed at spurring a new generation of environmental activism – have had to be curtailed. Earth Day is now going online instead, and everyone with a smart phone or internet connection can take part. Two projects are currently active, on plastic and air quality, with more to follow, including tracking declining insect populations. Taking pictures of plastic litter and uploading them will allow for greater tracking of the plastic waste problem than has been possible up to now. Knowing what kind of litter is prevalent and where will help in formulating plastic waste reduction policies. The added bonus is that any cleaning up of plastic litter you do on your daily exercise outdoors will also be tracked. Air quality has improved under the coronavirus lockdowns, but that is likely to be short-lived as restrictions are lifted. The Earth Day air quality app invites people to photograph their horizon daily and send it in, to be processed centrally to gain a clearer picture of air pollution around the world. Anyone itching for a bit of escapism without forbidden travel can spend some quality time in central America, courtesy of the Spotting Spider Monkeys project. Spider monkeys are fascinating creatures, very long-lived primates that are slow to reproduce, with each female on average having only one infant every three years. Huge areas of the monkeys’ habitat are being lost to agriculture and other encroachment, with palm oil production one of the leading causes. All spider monkey species are now classed as threatened with extinction. Researchers are now using drones to track spider monkeys through the forest, and using the footage they are developing an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of finding spider monkeys on its own. Before it can get to that stage, however, the systems needs to be fed thousands of images tagged for the presence of spider monkeys, to train the algorithm. This would take years, without the input of citizen scientists who are being asked to look at the images from surveillance cameras and point to the presence of spider monkeys. This will also help researchers track the pattern of habitat loss and deforestation, which are threats to other species as well as the monkeys. Leaving home only once a day for exercise might seem to give little opportunity for outdoor citizen science projects, but you too can do your bit. Photographing blossom on your daily walk will help the National Trust compile a changing gallery of pictures from around the country to delight those who can’t make it to see the spring blooms in person. Hundreds of thousands of people have now joined up with the charity’s #BlossomWatch, either by sending in pictures or looking at what others have contributed. The project was launched last month to emulate hanami, the Japanese custom of celebrating the fleeting sight and scent of blossom. Next year, the National Trust will develop the project further and produce a map to track the blossom across the UK, with a scientific purpose – it will help track climate change, and shed light on the pollinating insect who rely on blossom, and the birds who feed on them in turn. On similar lines, the Nature’s Calendar website run by the Woodland Trust allows people to record when they see their first butterfly or birds of the spring. With 2.9m records currently, it is the biggest biological record of its kind in the UK and ripe for more. Coronavirus lockdowns have cleared the streets of our cities of traffic and people and sent nature and wildlife bounding, splashing and scurrying to fill the vacuum. The City Nature Challenge has run for five years, but this year promises to be different. Participants photograph any form of wildlife – from interesting fungi or even slime mould, to insects and birds, to the traces of animals – droppings, fur, feathers, shells or even carcases. They are uploaded via the iNaturalist app and the online community helps to identify them. It takes place from 24 to 27 April, with the results to be announced on 4 May. The observations gathered become open-source data that will help scientists gauge patterns of global change in natural ecosystems and wildlife. One for the rainy days is a project from Reading University, which will help researchers shed new light on the climate crisis by making local rainfall records of the past digitally accessible, so they can be fed into computer models. Some of Britain’s rainfall and temperature records go back centuries, and this has been invaluable in drawing up detailed pictures of the past climate, and thus computer models used to forecast climate change. But some of these vast hoards of data are still marooned in reams of old-fashioned paper records, and thus effectively unusable. Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning to rescue these obscure rain gauge records, using citizen scientists to do the work. Under the Rainfall Rescue project, volunteers will fill the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing observations from scans of the old paper records. Rainfall is already proving popular: in the first 24 hours after the launch, 450,000 tasks had been completed, reports Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading. “These records will help scientists better understand how and why rainfall varies so much in different locations across the UK. With much of the population facing long spells indoors due to Covid-19, the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide a welcome distraction.” Coronavirus has highlighted the plight of people in developing countries who struggle with the basics of life, and whose precarious existence could topple over into disaster. One of the ways in which development organisations are hoping to improve people’s lives is through providing safe access to power, for clean cooking and for lighting, that will help children with their learning and adults to earn extra money. The Power To the People project will help train artificial intelligence algorithms to spot buildings from photographs of rural areas in developing countries, which in turn will allow them to be connected to the power grid. Human speech is one of the abiding scientific mysteries, and language development is a fascinating study. Scientists have been recording baby speech, from children aged between three months and four years, whose parents have agreed for them to wear a recorder for several hours each day. The resulting clips can record some of the first sounds babies make. But by their nature, the recordings also capture a lot of background noise, such as parental speech, television or other sources of sound. Armchair researchers can listen to the recordings and identify short clips by their type of sound, to detect which are worth further study. What could be more cheering in isolation than to listen to babies experimenting with speech for the first time? Coronavirus may be the most pressing health issue globally, but other diseases have not gone away. Tuberculosis is on the rise again, as new drug-resistant bacteria have surged among the poor and vulnerable around the world. Over the next five years, researchers will be collecting more than 100,00 samples from infected patients, and they want to work on testing which antibiotics are still effective, to understand how and where resistance is growing. Nearly 20,000 volunteers have signed up already. Penguin Watch allows sharp-eyed citizen scientists to mark penguins in footage taken in the Antarctic from cameras set up by zoologists near colonies in the region. Penguins are under threat from the climate crisis, pollution, disturbance and fisheries. Monitoring has been inhibited by the difficulty of gaining access to such remote areas, and the ability to crunch through the data that has been collected. Researchers at Oxford University are using people’s penguin spotting assistance to trawl through the collected data and enabling them to gauge the crucial timing of key events in the penguin’s yearly cycle, and tell whether they are changing under the influence of global heating."
"We quickly fell into a routine after lockdown began, something I never seem to manage normally. These past weeks have taught me that it’s not such a bad thing to tread and retread the same paths. Every day I look at these same hills, these same shores, and every day they show me something new. Over time, these daily walks build up, one upon the other, to create a long view: a portrait of a place through time. A few days ago, for the first time this season, I heard a familiar voice rising above the rest like a flautist. It sang a sliding upwards note which it then repeated, gathering pace, until it hit its rhythmic, rippling peak. I searched the sky for the source: wings outstretched, and that unmistakable bill – a long and slender curved proboscis – less hummingbird than hummingbird moth. A curlew, Numenius arquata, announcing his presence at his breeding ground. He had a distinctive flight pattern too, making a laboured, flapping climb before a smooth and effortless gliding descent. Rising and falling, stitching the air over the marshy meadowland near where the Hoy Sound pounds the coast as he searched for a mate. After a moment, a second voice rose to meet his: revving up just as he had, moving through the gears, escalating to that same bubbling crescendo. A rival, I supposed, but to me they sounded as a well-rehearsed duet, an ode to spring. The following day came the squeeze-toy squall of lapwings, and I spotted their tumbling butterfly flights, flashing white underwings as if showing their bloomers. And from above, piccolo-shrill, the skylark in ascendance, singing his heart out, who rose until he was a black dot in a vibrant sky, then parachuted down. A phenologist will build up records over many years: the dates of the arrivals of new migrants, the opening of flowers, the first frogspawn. I find these daily, government-sanctioned ambles across home ground have sharpened me to such minute developments, the inching forward of the season as it takes uneven, tottering steps towards summer. The sweeping drama of the everyday."
"Fires caused by portable barbecues, wild flowers being dug up, the disturbance of shorebirds, and an avalanche of rubbish. These are just some of the threats to Britain’s wild places as record numbers enjoy coastal and countryside “staycations”. Beleaguered rangers complain that a new generation of holidaymakers are treating the countryside like a festival site, leaving behind tents, chairs and excrement, as well as endangering rare habitats and wildlife. “It’s like no previous law of behaviour applies,” said one warden in Devon, whosecoastal nature reserve has been the busiest he has seen it in 40 years. “Anything you would expect people to understand, such as littering or people using the countryside as a lavatory, they ignore.” Conservationists and landowners are particularly concerned by the escalating fire risk with tinderbox conditions at many beauty spots, and a surge in wild campers – or “fly-campers” – lighting fires and portable barbecues. A fire destroyed 140 acres of heathland on Chobham Common, Surrey, last weekend. During the last bank holiday weekend, more than 20 serious moorland and grassland fires devastated areas in the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales and New Forest. The British Mountaineering Council is calling for the use of disposable barbecues on open moorland to be made a criminal offence. In Dartmoor, one of the few places in England where wild camping is legal, the Dartmoor National Park Authority has deployed emergency powers to temporarily ban wild camping after a dramatic increase in “fly-camping” at Bellever, where more than 50 fire pits were dug into the moor on one night. The authorities hope the August-long ban will give the beauty spot time to recover. Craig Best, the National Trust’s countryside manager for West Yorkshire, said his team feared a big moorland fire. “We’ve got the bank holiday weekend looming and even when the moorlands are tinder-dry there’ll be every chance two or three individuals will be having a barbecue there, and they can so easily get out of control,” he said. “It’s almost like a perfect storm,” he added, citing the combination of post-lockdown liberation, the heatwave and the long closure of household recycling centres, which caused a huge increase in fly-tipping. Problems reported by rangers include unprecedented wild camping in the Lake District; huge quantities of nitrous oxide canisters discarded over Marsden Moor, close to Manchester, Leeds and Huddersfield; illegal speedboating in the Ore estuary in Suffolk; and huge quantities of excrement, even where toilets are open because visitors are avoiding public toilets due to coronavirus fears. The Devon coastal reserve warden, who asked to remain anonymous, said he found a family had dismantled a “dead hedge” (a feature used to provide wildlife habitat) to make a teepee, decorating it with yellow flag irises that they dug up. “They just couldn’t understand that it wasn’t acceptable,” he said. Some visitors have argued that pictures of rubbish piled up beside bins demonstrate that more bins are required, or that they need emptying more regularly. But conservationists say people should take their rubbish home. “You’re seeing the worst part of human nature and a deterioration in the habitats you’re trying to manage because you’re having to concentrate on emptying bins,” said the Devon warden. Jake Fiennes, the director of England’s largest national nature reserve at Holkham estate, said 20,000 people were visiting the estate’s beach, in the Norfolk Coast area of natural beauty, each day. Reported incidents include kites being flown where terns nest, disturbing the birds, and a resting seal pup being picked up and flung back into the water. “It’s crazy, absolutely crazy. Every day feels like an August bank holiday,” Fiennes said. “It’s a totally different demographic – north Norfolk coast visitors are usually pretty middle class but we’re not seeing the older birders anymore, we’re seeing a lot of young people. The positive is we have a chance to engage with a whole different section of society.” Fiennes said knowledge of the Countryside Code seemed to have “fallen by the wayside” among today’s young. “Shouldn’t the natural world be part of our national curriculum?” he asked. But conservationists are desperate not to appear unwelcoming to a new generation of younger, urban visitor. “We’ve got to be careful as a sector about saying you can only come into the countryside if you’ve studied the Countryside Code,” said Ben McCarthy, the National Trust’s head of nature and conservation ecology. “The long-term solution to recovering nature has to be better engagement and better experiences for the widest range of the public. There’s good evidence that once people have positive experiences in nature they start to have pro-environmental attitudes.” Nikki Williams of The Wildlife Trusts said the tension between unprecedented numbers of visitors and rare species in fragile habitats showed the importance of ensuring people had access to local nature and didn’t simply drive to beauty-spots. “You go to a place labelled ‘countryside’. It’s a visitor experience, whereas it should be integrated into our lives,” she said. “We advocate for a nature recovery network. A really important part of that is more on-your-doorstep nature. Then you start to understand more about nature and you also don’t get in the car and drive to a place that has a line drawn around it and says ‘This is where the good stuff is.’” The Wildlife Trusts are particularly concerned that the government’s new planning white paper divides the country into protected zones and areas of development and regeneration – exacerbating the idea that “nature” is an excursion to an overvisited, distant nature reserve. Nick Bruce-White, the RSPB’s regional director of southern England, said: “This interest in the outdoors and green space is something we couldn’t have wished for six months ago. I hope we can build on it. There’s a small minority of people who are doing wantonly illegal things and a bigger cohort of new visitors who, without sounding too patronising, don’t understand the basics of how to use the countryside appropriately.” Bruce-White said the RSPB, alongside the National Farmers’ Union and others, were pushing the government to include more messaging about responsible enjoyment of the countryside in its Covid-19 broadcasts."
"Around 3,000 sheep sent back from Saudi Arabia by ship to Sudan have died of hunger and thirst according to a Sudanese government minister. Some drowned on the voyage. Saudi Arabia returned 58,000 sheep to Sudan after finding out that quarantine procedures in Sudan had been compromised, leaving some animals without vaccination against diseases including Rift Valley fever. Sheep are brought over from western Sudan to the Port of Sudan in the east of the country and held in quarantine before being exported to Saudi Arabia. While there they are vaccinated against three diseases; HS (Hemorrhagic septicemia), PPR (Peste des petits ruminants) and Rift Valley fever. Sudan’s minister of animal resources, Dr Adil Farah said the quarantines had been broken, with some animals replaced. “We have problems in our quarantines in some of the states, especially in eastern Sudan in Kassala and Gadarif states,” he said. “The animal quarantines are open so some of the exporters are cheats and might have got inside the quarantines after we vaccinated the animals and replaced some of them – that’s the problem.”While the sheep were still on board, waiting to be returned to Sudan, thousands of the animals died after drinking saltwater from the Red Sea. “The losers in this process at the end are the small producers in the western parts of Sudan where most of the cattle come from,” said Farah. Live animals are one of Sudan’s most important exports, bringing in approximately $500 million (£384m) in 2018, according to the International Trade Centre. Saudi Arabia buys more than 70% of its livestock from Sudan. Late last year thousands of sheep in the country died of similar conditions – hunger and thirst – when Saudi Arabia blocked trade with Sudan following the country’s announcement of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever. The disease had been spreading in the eastern and western parts of Sudan among animals and – to a lesser extent – humans.Sudan is planning to send the surviving sheep back to Saudi Arabia. But the deaths of the animals has had a huge economic impact on the exporters in Sudan, who are desperately waiting to resume trade. Livestock exporter Taha Gasim from Omdurman, Sudan, said he had spent thousands of pounds on food, drink and vaccinations for the sheep while waiting for Saudi Arabia to let them go.The news comes as Sudan announced it had lost 40% of its revenues due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

"The safety of US meat plant workers is at risk, workers and campaigners believe, because of a triple whammy of increased line speeds, higher turnover and fewer workers due to coronavirus. Authorities, meanwhile, are failing to keep up with the problem. A freedom of information request to the US government shows a dramatic decrease in the number of plant inspectors, while the number of whistleblower complaints has increased by 30% over the past year. At least 44,530 US meat plant workers have tested positive for Covid since the beginning of the year, and at least 213 have died. But an order put in place by President Donald Trump means plants must remain open. A number of poultry plants have been allowed to increase their line speeds, despite protests from animal protection groups and workers’ rights organizations such as the National Employment Law Project. In July, United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) filed a complaint against the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) over the waiver program. In late April, the agriculture department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said that it was no longer accepting line speed waiver requests. However, it has since brought forward a new proposal that could do away with waivers entirely and allow companies to increase line speeds from 140 birds a minute to 175, as long as they meet “certain criteria”. Meanwhile, between April and July, the FSIS reported a decrease of nearly a 10th of its inspector workforce, according to data obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Over the four months, the agency eliminated more than 100 on-line positions and lost a further 198 food inspectors and vets responsible for ensuring meat-processing facilities comply with food safety and animal treatment standards.  Government data on severe injuries, collected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), is currently only available through April. A recent audit of the agency noted that it did not have enough staff to deal with an increase in worker complaints, and showed a 30% rise in whistleblower complaints from February to May compared to the same period in 2019. It concluded that the agency needed to improve its handling of whistleblowers. But spokespeople for UFCW and the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health both told the Guardian that they believed injuries had been rising and would continue to, based on what they are hearing from workers. Tyson, one of the US’s largest meat producers, has come under particular fire, and is currently facing a lawsuit. Workers at Tyson plants, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, described the pressure they felt as staffing numbers decreased while speeds rose. “We have double the work because of the lack of workforce on the line,” said a worker at the company’s Berry Street facility in Springdale, Arkansas. Some plants with outbreaks, like the Berry Street facility – where nearly 250 out of 1,100 employees tested positive in June – have not changed their operations, but rather pushed ahead short-handed, workers said. The Berry Street worker told the Guardian that, following a mass testing and required quarantine, only about half the 25 people working on her line remained, yet they were still required to help eviscerate the same number of chickens. Supervisors shuffled her around to new departments to fill in for missing workers and she was often pushed to work overtime, requests she was unable to refuse for fear of being penalized. “I do everything because of the lack of workforce,” the 42-year-old said. “Even though I’m afraid, I have to work. I have to pay bills and rent and everything.” Another employee at Tyson’s Chick-N-Quick facility in Rogers, Arkansas, described how he narrowly avoided a falling 40-pound box of chicken during a recent shift. A fellow worker on his line recently sliced his hand open with a sharp tool. He puts both instances down to having to cover for sick and missing workers. “It’s more dangerous because we are fewer people and have to work faster, and by working faster we can’t consider safety,” he said. A Tyson spokesperson told the Guardian that the company had prioritized the health and safety of its workers, and had “transformed our facilities with a host of safeguards that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance.” A Covid-19 monitoring strategy is now in place, and there are additional occupational health staff, with a new post of chief medical officer created. The strategy was welcomed by UFCW, while the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) acknowledged that Tyson Foods had “made significant strides.”  The Tyson spokesperson also noted that plants slowed production as staffing levels fell due to the pandemic. “We want to make sure we’re operating in a way that ensures the safety of our team members and the food they’re producing. Hourly team members are involved, using checklists to help determine staffing levels and appropriate line speeds.” “Like most businesses, we have an attendance policy that encourages people to come to work,” the Tyson spokesperson wrote. “However, we continue to tell our team members to stay home if they have symptoms of Covid or have tested positive for the virus.” “Shortage of workers and overworking workers? That’s nothing new. It’s an incredibly dangerous job, it’s always been. Is Covid making it worse? Of course,” Amanda Hitt, director of the Food Integrity Campaign at the Government Accountability Project, told the Guardian. “If there are less people doing the job, you’re going to see that workforce driven harder. That’s the math of it.” Martha Hernandez, a former meat plant worker, said the behavior of regulatory bodies and industry giants during the pandemic was unsurprising. Hernandez, 55, helped found the Arkansas-based workers’ advocacy organization Venceremos. The organization is part of a lawsuit filed in July against Tyson that claims the company is misleading consumers by promoting its commitment “to improving the health and safety [of workers]” in advertisements. Tyson has denied the claim. Hernandez worked at the Chick-N-Quick in Rogers, mainly grinding birds into mince used to make nuggets, and after several months developed carpal tunnel syndrome in her right hand, a condition that she said required three surgeries. A 2013  report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 42% of poultry workers who were studied had some evidence of carpal tunnel. “There are so many injustices there,” she said of the plants. “Sometimes you get really dizzy from how fast the line speed went, but we are not allowed to say, ‘We’re not going to work at this speed.’ They’re not asking you, they’re telling you you have to do it.” “Production rates in our plants vary and depend on available staffing as well as the type of product being produced,” the Tyson spokesperson wrote. “Our top priority is the health and safety of our team members. That’s why we’ve transformed our facilities with a host of safeguards that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance – from symptom scanning and face masks to workstation dividers and social distance monitors.” In response to a Washington Post story in April critical of the company’s Covid response, Tyson took out a full-page ad in the paper. In it, board chairman John H Tyson wrote that the company was focused on providing a “safe work environment” during the crisis. “I am grateful for our team members, but most of all I care about their health and safety,” Tyson stated. But for Hernandez, who struggles to hold a cup of coffee with her right hand due to her injuries, those words ring hollow. “They don’t care for us at all,” she said.

"A nest of arm-sized sticks built on a precipitous crag by an octogenarian conservationist dangling from a rope has enticed a pair of golden eagles back to the Highlands of Scotland. The eyrie handmade by Roy Dennis, a renowned conservationist who has masterminded the revival of endangered species across Britain, helped the eagles successfully fledge the first chick on Trees for Life’s Dundreggan estate in 40 years. A team of volunteers on the rewilded estate between Loch Ness and Skye hauled large sticks to a remote cliff high on the hills where the remnants of an old nest had been spotted. Secured with a safety rope, Dennis climbed down to a ledge where he wove the sticks together. Golden eagles are very sensitive to disturbance, so the conservationists knew it might take some time. Five years on, when Trees for Life’s Dundreggan manager, Doug Gilbert, checked the artificial nest this spring, he found it had been extended by the eagles, who had built “a vast structure” on top. The eagles’ first chick successfully fledged last week. “This is a rewilding success story beyond our wildest dreams,” said Gilbert. “I’ve been checking the eyrie regularly since we built it in 2015, hoping to see evidence that the eagles had returned, and now they have. As golden eagles may use their nesting sites for generations, we’re hoping they are back for the long term.” The golden eagle, Britain’s second largest bird of prey after the white-tailed eagle, was driven to extinction in England and Wales in the mid-1800s after centuries of persecution.  The bird has been making a slow recovery in Scotland but continues to be threatened by illegal persecution, with eagles shot or poisoned. According to Stuart Benn, a member of the Highland Raptor Study Group, golden eagles are “undergoing a marked expansion in the Highlands, recolonising ground they haven’t been on for many years and even colonising some completely new areas.” The birds may have been helped at Dundreggan by burgeoning numbers of black grouse – a favoured prey – after the restoration of waist-high “montane” tree species such as dwarf birch and downy willow. Trees for Life has been rewilding the 10,000-acre former deer-stalking estate since 2008."
"The humble spud, staple of the British dinner table, has weathered storm, flood and lockdown, but farmers are on tenterhooks ahead of the crucial growing season for the key crop as the UK heatwave is followed by thunderstorms and deluges. Farmers are desperate to avoid a repeat of last year, when good growing weather over the summer was followed by heavy rains in some areas from late September that left the ground too sodden to harvest for months, spelling disaster for many potato growers. “It’s too early to say what this year’s harvest will be like, but the next few weeks will be crucial,” said Alex Godfrey, the chair of the potato forum at the National Farmers’ Union, who grows potatoes in north Lincolnshire. “The crops in the ground look good, and have done so far this year, but whether that yields tubers we don’t know yet. We only completed last year’s harvest on 23 March this year. That’s very unusual.” Mark Alton, who has a farm in North Yorkshire, said: “Last year we all had big smiles at this stage, when things were looking bright. I had superb potatoes in the ground and started to lift them on 24 September. On 25 September, the heavens opened and 150mm of rain fell in the following six or seven weeks.” That put paid to about a quarter of last year’s crop. “But I am still optimistic and enthusiastic,” he added. The hot bright start to spring this year has already caused problems for some. Nigel Adams, who usually produces 7,500 tonnes of potatoes a year in the West Midlands, said yields were slightly down in July for his early crop, after only 3mm of rain in May. “We’re hoping for it to be a bit cooler and a little bit of rain [in September],” he said. Extreme weather, from record-breaking heat and drought to devastating floods, has caused severe hardship for Britain’s potato farmers. “In the last two years, we’ve seen the worst crops of potatoes for the last 40 years,” said Howard Snape, the regional president of McCain Foods, the maker of oven chips and other potato products. Potato farmers watched their tubers shrivel in the record-breaking drought of 2018, when relentless sunshine and months with little rain baked the fields. Yields fell by about 10-15% overall, but some farmers lost more than a quarter of their crop, while the quality of the remaining potatoes suffered too, with undersized and wizened specimens. Last year the problem was too much rain, when flooding arrived at the worst time for many farmers, as they were preparing to lift their crop in September and October. The potatoes had benefited from good weather and farmers were looking forward to a bumper crop after the previous year’s travails. But as rain poured down, the harvester machines could not even reach the fields. Unable to rescue their crop, many farmers were forced to watch it rot, while others had to wait until this year to finish harvesting. Again, yields were down by about 10-15% overall. If that were not enough, this year potato farmers were hammered by the coronavirus lockdown. About half of the UK’s potato crop goes to catering, according to Snape. That market disappeared almost overnight when the lockdown was enforced, leaving farmers with nowhere to sell their produce. Prices for potatoes at the farm gate fell by half for many farmers during lockdown, from about £300 to £320 a tonne to about £150 to £160 a tonne. Many farmers were unprepared for the financial consequences. However, most farmers managed to avoid waste as supermarkets stepped up their sales of fresh potatoes to homebound consumers, even taking on the bigger potatoes that would normally be sent for processing and to chip shops, and in some cases specialist varieties usually destined for top-end restaurants. “The market did a very good job of dealing with the surplus,” said Godfrey. “Though there was a large transfer of value from growers to the retailers.” McCain, which as the biggest purchaser of British potatoes buys about 15% of the crop, is moving to help its 250 UK farmers with an investment of £25m over the next five years in new technologies and equipment. The money will be spent on irrigation systems in some areas, where water is likely to be an increasing problem in future years, and on giving farmers access to new machinery, such as self-propelling harvesters than can cope with sodden ground. These machines can cost about £400,000 each, putting them out of reach of many small farmers. But potato farmers also need reassurance from the government, said Godfrey. Brexit is looming – “we had forgotten about it, there have been so many other things to think about,” said Adams – and with it a massive change for British agriculture, as the government seeks new trade deals that could undercut UK standards. “If you want to eat good wholesome food at the standards that British agriculture has achieved in the last 20 years, someone needs to pay for it,” said Alton. “If you’re not prepared to pay money for higher British standards, British agriculture will change dramatically, and probably for the worse.” Godfrey points to another lesser-known danger following Brexit. When EU subsidies are cut off, the government plans to move farmers from subsidies based on the land they farm to payments for the environmental goods and services they provide. What is still not clear, however, is how those environmental land management contracts will work in practice, especially for farmers who do not own their land and thus may not be able to guarantee long-term environmental management. Like many other potato growers, Godfrey rents many of the fields he plants for the growing season only, from March to October each year. “We are hoping we will not be excluded, but it is not well understood that a large proportion of what is grown is on rented land. We just don’t know how that will work yet.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We have been working closely with farmers, land managers and other stakeholders to design environmental land management (ELM). As part of this we are considering how ELM could work under the various forms of land management in practice across England, including land which is rented. We will continue to refine the scheme during our national pilot next year.”"
"Indigenous people living at the headwaters of the Amazon have called on European banks to stop financing oil development in the region, as it poses a threat to them and damages a fragile ecosystem, after a new report found $10bn in previously undisclosed funding for oil in the region. The headwaters of the Amazon in Ecuador and Peru are home to more than 500,000 indigenous people, including some who choose to live in voluntary isolation. The area, covering about 30m hectares (74m acres), hosts a diverse rainforest ecosystem, but it is threatened by the expansion of oil drilling. Many banks have pledged to halt or limit the finance they provide to fossil fuel projects, particularly in delicate ecosystems, but the new report focuses on a grey area of bank lending: instead of project finance, the authors looked at trade finance. Project finance is used to start and develop oil wells, fossil fuel extraction, refineries and pipelines, but trade finance is used to move the oil and gas from production to refineries. Banks make loans to companies seeking trade finance, sometimes through intermediaries, but these loans often do not fall under their standard sustainability goals. In a new report, Stand.earth Research Group and Amazon Watch traced $10bn (£7.6bn) of trade finance since 2009 from 19 European banks covering oil in the headwaters of the Amazon. Marlon Vargas, the president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon, said: “I wonder if the executives of banks in Europe know the real cost of their financing. How can they possibly sleep peacefully knowing their money leaves thousands of indigenous peoples and communities without water, without food and in devastating health conditions due to the pollution of the Coca and Napo rivers? It is time for the banks, companies and consumers of the oil extracted in the Ecuadorian Amazon to acknowledge how their businesses affect our territories and way of life.” An oil spill in April in Ecuador contaminated hundreds of miles of two major rivers and affected 35,000 people in river communities, and there have been ongoing oil spills in Peru. Previous oil exploration in the region resulted in about 17m gallons of crude oil being spilled. About 40% of the oil is exported to refineries in California. Tyson Miller, the forest programmes director at Stand.earth, told the Guardian: “The Amazon sacred headwaters region is a cultural and ecological gem. It is considered to be the most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystem on the planet, maintaining the hydrological cycle for all of the Americas, and helping to regulate Earth’s climate. “New and ongoing oil extraction in the region is a gateway to deforestation and increased agricultural and industrial activity, which is why indigenous leaders in the region have repeatedly voiced their opposition to the expansion of the oil industry, and other industrial activities in their territories.” Several of the banks named in the report have confirmed that trade finance – unlike project finance for fossil fuels – did not fall under their standard pledges on sustainable lending, but said they were engaged in reducing their environmental impact. Credit Suisse said: “The report refers to our oil and gas policy and mentions requirements that apply to project-related transactions with respect to indigenous peoples and areas of high conservation value. However, these policy requirements do not relate to trade finance services.” The company added: “We are committed to a responsible approach to business, and conduct due diligence on our clients’ activities. Environmental and social risks are assessed in a bank-wide risk review process, guided by our sector-specific policies. These are regularly reviewed and updated to take account of developments, including indigenous peoples’ rights or climate change.” ING said: “We do not recognise the calculations of aggregate exposure in the report. This might be explained due to the extended time horizon and the change in client relationship over time. For instance, two traders mentioned in the report are no longer clients of ING.” The company added: “ING takes a strong stance against deforestation and integrates assessments of biodiversity and nature impacts in our transaction due diligence. We encourage commodity clients to obtain certifications with chain-of-custody requirements. While certification schemes for soft commodities are more widely available, comparable certifications don’t yet exist for oil and gas. This makes the traceability of oil and gas trade challenging, particularly in the trade of commodities of mixed and diverse origin.” UBS said: “We apply an in-depth environmental and social risk policy framework to all of our transactions, products, services and activities, including commodity trade finance, in order to identify and assess environmental and social risks. As such we have declined transactions where the origin of oil is verifiably associated with breaches of our standards, such as indigenous people’s land rights or Unesco world heritage sites. We maintain ongoing dialogues with relevant stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations to inform UBS’s approach to, and understanding of, societal issues and concerns.” BNP Paribas said: “The lack of explanations on the methodology and the aggregation of data whose provenance cannot be verified, make any analysis impossible and render us unable to comment on this report.” Rabobank said: “Due to client confidentiality, we can’t elaborate on individual practices. What we can tell you however, is that because of our policies and client engagement strategy, Rabobank is no longer involved in trade flows extracted from the Amazon Sacred Headwaters region.”"
"The creation of the first designated bathing water spot in a UK river has moved one step closer after the government published a consultation on the plans. A stretch of the River Wharfe in Ilkley, which is popular with swimmers and families, would be the only river in the country to be subjected to strict monitoring during May to October to ensure the water is of good quality. Local people and businesses overwhelmingly voted for the bathing water status during a campaign run by Ilkley Clean River Group before they submitted the application to the government. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on Friday put the idea out to an eight-week consultation. Campaigners want the status to be created to ensure the water is subjected to more rigorous testing and to stop the river being used to discharge sewage from overflows when it rains. There are no rivers with designated bathing water status in Britain, unlike countries such as France, where there are 573. “Local people and agencies all support the application and have worked hard to prove how much we need it, so we anticipate a positive outcome,” said Becky Malby, of the clean river campaign. “People living in Ilkley expect our sewage to be treated, not dumped straight into the river every time it rains. We were shocked to find that our river was being used as an open sewer. We have stories of children getting sick as a result of dipping in the river. This is a disgrace. Bathing status is a critical step in cleaning up our river.” The Guardian revealed last month that raw sewage was discharged by water companies into rivers via storm overflows for 1.5m hours in 2019. River campaigners are pressing for bathing water status to be rolled out in popular river bathing areas to force water companies to stop the discharges. If the River Wharfe is granted bathing water status it will be monitored along the lines of coastal waters, which are given designation as excellent, good, satisfactory or poor. Campaigners hope it will lead to other rivers gaining the designation, forcing water companies, the Environment Agency and the government to invest in solutions to stop the discharges into rivers. The chair of the Environment Agency, Emma Howard Boyd, told the Guardian that if people wanted bathing water designations for rivers it would be a “game changer” that would require more government funding. Defra said if successful, it would mean a part of the river flowing through Ilkley would be monitored regularly during the bathing season (15 May to 30 September) for bacteria detrimental to human health. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said: “We protect people’s health at popular swimming spots across the country by requiring the water quality at those sites to be regularly monitored. At present, 93% of bathing waters in England have ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ water quality. “I encourage local residents to take part in this consultation so we can have as many views as possible to inform our final decision.” The area of the River Wharfe under consideration runs between Ilkley Main Bridge and Beanlands Island."
"When the big winds blew, phantoms chased through the barley. Strong air currents bowed a million heads in south-westerly supplication, sending wave after lapping wave off on a roll, a tide sweeping from left to right towards a hedgerow shoreline that it would never reach. The whole crop spoke as one voice, countering the blustery buffeting at my shoulder with a united “shh”. But barley has its rebellious streaks. Every so often, a gap appeared out of nothing, as if someone had stood up to run through the field, an invisible Moses parting the grass sea, in a “make way, room for one only” sprint. Each dash through the crop left no path, no trace. In the field next door, wheat had no truck with the fairies. If the well-spaced barley was free-ranging, then here was a battery-farmed phalanx. The seeds had been sown so close together, almost lawn-dense, that each plant’s splayed leaves jostled and buttressed those of its neighbour while the stems stood stalk-still. When a gust came to strike, the wheat heads shivered and bobbed in discrete huddles, as if the probing wind were testing each part of the field in turn. The leaves beneath the agitated crowns made rasping complaints as they clashed. However, the centre held, withstanding the incursion of any intruder, corporeal or spiritual. The wind has stilled in the barley. Mounting an earth bank for a vantage point, I look over a field of furry tops, a shagpile carpet. Coming down to kneel before it, I marvel at this plant whose taming over tens of thousands of years into domesticity has not bred out its extravagant flourish. The stem and packed seedhead are conventional cereal, but the tip is topped with an outrageous decoration, a cluster of antennae-like spikes called awns that spear out 10cm or more beyond the necessary. The upper parts are top-heavy, the nodding head swollen with ripening seed. The grasses are more yellow than green and, in a few more weeks, the suppleness of youth will be traded for golden maturity. Age will bring a stiffening of stems, soft whispers will turn to dry crackling, and the ghosts in the barley will run no more."
"When Brent Hughes started studying the seagrass beds of Elkhorn Slough, an estuary in Monterey Bay on California’s central coast, he was surprised by what he found. In this highly polluted estuary, excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff spur the growth of algae on seagrass leaves, which kills the plants. Yet in 2010, Hughes noticed that the seagrass beds were thriving. It did not make sense. “This is the highest nutrient concentration that I had ever seen on the planet,” says Hughes, a biologist at Sonoma State University. “Any model would suggest there should be no seagrass there and yet it was expanding.” Hughes set out to solve the mystery. He examined every possible factor, including water quality, temperature and changes in seagrass coverage over time, going back 50 years. He was not making any progress until he was approached by a boat captain named Yohn Gideon who had been running wildlife tours in the slough since 1995. Over the years, the captain had handed clickers to his passengers, asking them to count the sea otters they saw. Hughes overlaid the captain’s sea otter counts with historical seagrass coverage data and realised the two graphs were almost perfectly in sync. When sea otter numbers went up, seagrass went up, too. “You don’t see that very often in ecology. That was a eureka moment,” he says. While Hughes had often encountered sea otters in the slough during his dives, he never paid attention to them. Now they were clearly linked to seagrass health, but how?  Sea otters may be North America’s smallest marine mammal, but they have a huge appetite. Unlike other species that rely on a layer of fat called blubber to keep them warm, otters use their dense fur and a high metabolic rate to maintain body heat in the chilly waters of the northern pacific. To achieve that, they must eat 25% of their body weight every day, munching on a variety of marine invertebrates, including sea urchins, clams and crabs. When the otters first moved into the slough in the 1980s, they put their big appetites to work eating crabs. With fewer crabs to prey on them, the California sea hares – a sea slug – grew larger and became more abundant. The slugs fed on the algae growing on the seagrass, leaving the leaves healthy and clean. Hughes had discovered a trophic cascade that had made the seagrass beds the healthiest of any estuary he had seen on the west coast. Since the otters arrived in the slough, the seagrass has recovered and increased by more than 600% in the past three decades. Sea otters had already shown that they were capable of a large influence on the ecosystem. In the 1970s, biologist James Estes was conducting research in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska and noticed some areas where the seafloor was covered with sea urchins. As herbivores, urchins feed on kelp, and when their numbers are not kept in check by predators, no kelp remains. In contrast, in places where sea otters were present, kelp forests were thriving. Estes demonstrated that by eating urchins, sea otters created the opportunity for kelp to flourish. Sea otters gained their official title as a keystone species.  But the discovery that sea otters could also be important players in estuaries came as an ecological surprise. In fact, scientists had not even expected sea otters to survive in an estuary. Hunted to near extinction by fur traders in the 18th and 19th centuries, sea otters had only survived in a few small, isolated populations in the North Pacific. Then, after the Fur Seal Treaty was signed in 1911, conservation efforts led to an increase in otter numbers. In California, the population grew from 50 in 1914 to about 3,000. On the coast of British Columbia, they were reintroduced between 1969 and 1972 and there are now about 8,100 of them. Since the otters were first recovering in kelp forests along the open coast, the scientists who studied the animals assumed that this was their primary habitat. When they started turning up in Elkhorn Slough in the 1980s, they thought that was an anomaly, failing to realise that they were in fact reoccupying old habitats. Archaeological and historical records indicate that otters were once abundant in California’s estuaries, prior to being driven to local extinction through over-hunting. “Scientists are subject to perception bias,” says Tim Tinker, a wildlife biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “Estuaries were traditionally very important to otters. But we did not really appreciate them as such. The ecological effects of otters on the outer coast dominated our thinking.” Estuaries were not even considered in the US fish and wildlife service’s plan for the recovery of the sea otter in California, listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act. Now, scientists and wildlife managers are turning to estuaries as potential places where sea otter numbers could grow. In the past decade, the expansion of sea otters on the California coast has been curbed unexpectedly by the presence of the great white sharks that are recovering from overfishing and by-catch, at the southern and northern edges of the otter range. Shark bites have become the primary source of otter mortality. “The population is constrained by a shark wall,” Tinker says. Estuaries could provide otters with an important refuge from sharks and other unfavourable coast conditions, such as storms and warming events. A recent paper suggests that San Francisco Bay, California’s largest estuary, could support about 6,000 otters, more than double the current population. “Once fully recovered, between a quarter and one third of the entire population in California could be accounted for by otters living in estuaries,” Tinker says. Scientists also believe that sea otters could be conservation allies, with their potential to help restore other polluted estuaries in California. “It is a two-way street,” Tinker says. “To have a resilient population of sea otters we may need them in estuaries but estuaries may also need sea otters.” Seagrass ecosystems perform important ecological functions. They provide nursery habitat for young fish and invertebrates, and they protect shorelines from storms and waves. They control erosion by holding down and trapping sediment. Seagrass absorbs carbon from the atmosphere and buries it in its roots, acting as a carbon sink. Hughes’ discovery of the positive impact that sea otters had on Elkhorn Slough’s seagrass made him wonder whether they could benefit other places. Still working in the slough, he observed that sea otters moved into the salt marsh portion of the estuary in 2012 and started having a positive influence on this fragile habitat. Before the otters’ arrival, numerous striped shore crabs were burrowing into the muddy banks and fed on the marsh roots, accelerating the erosion of the marsh. By eating the crabs, the otters are now helping make the salt marsh healthier, slowing down erosion, a discovery that could be significant for salt marshes elsewhere. “Salt marshes are one of those ecosystems that globally are in a state of decline. In California, we lost 90% of them,” says Hughes. In south-east Alaska and British Columbia, scientists are studying other ways that otters may be beneficial to seagrass beds. “Anywhere sea otters are going, I can guarantee change is going to happen,” Hughes says. But the long-term influence of these furry ecosystem engineers is not yet fully understood. For example, when sea otters look for clams to eat, they dig in the seagrass beds, leaving holes behind. “When you are watching otters digging for clams, you can see a cloud of sediment come up to the surface,” says Erin Foster, a marine ecologist studying the interactions between otters and seagrass at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia. “It looks like a bombed-out landscape when you come across a fresh site where there has been recent digging,” adds Margot Hessing-Lewis, also a marine ecologist with the Hakai Institute. Foster and Hessing-Lewis are investigating the possibility that when sea otters disturb the sediment they could be helping seagrass become more resilient to environmental changes by making the seagrass flower more often, potentially increasing the genetic diversity of the plants. As scientists are still learning about the full impact of sea otters on different habitats, they wonder about assisting the growth of the population, especially in California where the shark predation is making it difficult for otters to expand into new areas. Elkhorn Slough was the first estuary in California recolonised by sea otters, a process that was greatly accelerated by the release in the slough of 37 otters that had been rescued and rehabilitated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium in the 2000s. Future otter releases could be strategically used to help sea otter populations expand in other historic habitats, though it is not always without risk. Otters could be exposed to the threat of boat strikes, oil spills, human disturbances, and contamination from chemical pollutants.  The return of this top predator also comes at a cost to humans, since sea otters compete directly with shellfish fisheries which had developed in their absence. A recent study that analysed the costs and benefits linked to the reintroduction of sea otters to the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia found the benefits – including increasing fish populations, carbon sequestration and ecotourism – outweighed the losses to invertebrate fisheries by seven times. However, the benefits are not felt equally, especially among indigenous communities who rely on shellfish harvesting for food security. “Sea otter recovery is different from the recovery of any other species because they have such disproportionally big effects on the ecosystem,” Tinker says. “For most depleted species you are just worried about the conservation of the species but with sea otters, you are thinking how the entire ecosystem is going to change when they recover.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"When Onon took off above the rolling hills of the Khurkh valley in Mongolia last June, researchers had no idea if they would see him alive again. Along with one oriental cuckoo and three other common cuckoos, each fitted with a tiny tracking device, he was about to embark on an epic journey to southern Africa. Last month, he was the only bird to return safely with his tracker intact. “It’s an amazingly long migration,” says Dr Chris Hewson, senior research ecologist at the British Trust for Ornithology, who said Onon’s 26,000km round trip was one of the longest journeys recorded by any land bird. Onon has not only amazed conservationists, but gripped social media across the globe. As coronavirus lockdowns brought the world to a virtual standstill, fans followed online updates from the Mongolia Cuckoo Project, watching in awe as Onon cruised across oceans and made 27 border crossings in 16 countries. He returned on 27 May, having become a media celebrity in India, Kenya and Sweden. Back in Mongolia, he appeared on television and made newspaper headlines. Researchers are now studying data from his journey for clues about why cuckoos travel as far as they do, and how they might be affected by the climate crisis. Hewson, who worked on the project with the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia, admits he did not believe cuckoos were such proficient migrators. “Although they’ve got nice long wings, when they’re flying around the breeding site they look slightly ungainly compared to the other birds,” he says. In fact, cuckoos such as Onon, which migrate in search of caterpillars, their favourite food, travel remarkably fast, he adds. Using tailwinds, they can motor for more than 1,000km a day for a week. Caterpillars are most common in places that are sunny and wet and so, in summer, there are plenty in the Khurkh valley, in the south-east of the Khentii mountain range. As the weather changes they go to India for monsoon season, and then, as the wind changes, to east Africa. It’s not an easy journey. The four other birds that set off at the same time as Onon did not make it back. Their fate is unknown – their trackers may have failed or they may have died. One of them, Bayan, is thought to have died in Yunnan province, China, after flying 7,200km in just seven days from Somalia. As researchers compare the flight paths of cuckoos from across Asia, they are exploring why Onon and his peers choose such epic journeys. They could potentially winter in Asia or Australasia south of the equator, but they don’t, says Hewson. “Probably partly because the presence of a competitor species, the oriental cuckoo, makes this less profitable than it would otherwise be.”  The very long journey is perhaps easier than it might appear because there’s such an abundant supply of caterpillars on route, he adds. “If you’re finding food when you get there, it’s not such a costly thing to do in terms of energy.” This raises questions over how the cuckoos might manage if global heating or other threats affect the availability of food. “If their stopover sites get lost they will be in big trouble,” says Nyambayar Batbayar, of the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia, who said the project had raised awareness of the need to protect key flyways and the areas where the birds rest and eat. In Mongolia, schools in Khentii province have taken part in the project, helping to name the birds and closely following their journeys. Onon, named after a local river, has also attracted lots of attention among social media users in India, said Terry Townshend, who documented the cuckoos’ journeys through the website and Twitter account Birding Beijing. Twitter followers bombarded the site with questions about the journeys: “Can the cuckoos stop on water?” (they can only pause during ocean crossings if there’s an island) and “How long do they stop for?”(anything from a few hours to a few days). Back in the lush hills and wheat fields of the Khurkh valley, Onon is getting on with life. “He has no time to waste as he needs to set up his territory, defend it from competing males and mate with as many females as possible!” the Mongolia Cuckoo Project has informed his fans.

"From widescreen high-definition wildlife documentaries to food brands, royal crests, sporting teams and Disney movies, the lion is one of the most appropriated and revered animals on the planet. But this reverence sits in contrast to the falling numbers of the living, breathing muscular cats in Africa. In recent years, scientists have discovered a major problem underpinning efforts to conserve the big cat. Some are arguing that almost all the estimates of how many African lions are left, and where they are, could be wildly wrong. “We are just fundamentally not counting them properly,” says Alexander Braczkowski, a researcher based at the Resilient Conservation Laboratory at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. Braczkowski is among a group of researchers refining a new method of understanding not just how many African lions there are, but how they move, where they might be thriving and – ultimately – how to spend the millions of dollars each year that go towards their conservation. Braczkowski put the method to the test during a year spent monitoring and filming lions in the Queen Elizabeth conservation area in Uganda, as part of research at the University of Queensland. Braczkowski found the area’s lions were in a precarious state, with the home ranges of males much larger than previously estimated – suggesting they were having to travel further to find food. “The way these animals move is telling you how well they’re doing,” he says. “Small home ranges equals a lot of food.” Dr Arjun Gopalaswamy, a co-author of work with Braczkowski and science adviser to the Wildlife Conservation Society’s global programs, says this is a concerning trend, because larger home range sizes in big cats are usually associated with reduced density. “There’s great value in using methods that keep track of lion populations directly and we urge conservation and research communities to cease using ad hoc, indirect methods and shift to more reliable and direct methods,” he says. Braczkowski says he and colleagues have discovered that two established methods to count lions dominate most of published conservation studies. One involves searching for lion tracks on the ground and then extrapolating the findings to much wider areas using an equation developed decades ago. But Braczkowski says this method doesn’t account for the fact that lion numbers could be much more dense in some habitats than others, or the difficulty in counting tracks in places where they do not leave footprints. Another method is known as a “call-up survey” where observers go out at night with a large speaker and play distress calls of prey animals, then count the lions as they emerge from the darkness, hoping for an easy meal. But this runs the risk of counting the same animal twice – or of some animals not responding to the sounds. These methods, says Braczkowski, are “simply not reliable enough to understand how lion populations are doing over time”. The current estimates for lions across Africa suggest there are between 20,000 and 30,000 animals, spread among 102 populations across about 2.5m sq km. Numbers are known to be declining, but by how much, and where, is the subject of intense debate and great uncertainty. Even so, Braczkowski, who grew up in South Africa, says their numbers have likely dropped by half since 1994, “coincidentally the same year Disney’s The Lion King was released”. Braczkowski’s work is part of a method known as “spatial capture recapture statistics” that has been widely used to understand the conservation concerns for other big cats, but has almost never been used to examine the health of African lion populations. In a review of studies into African lion numbers, Braczkowski and colleagues argued the overuse of methods such as call-up surveys and track counting could be having a disastrous effect on lion conservation efforts. “This could have catastrophic consequences since underestimating lion numbers might cause us to triage an otherwise viable population, while overestimating density might cause under-investment in a population that requires active management,” they wrote. “Furthermore, non-robust methods can often produce spurious trends in lion population dynamics, which can further mislead conservation investments.” In Uganda, Braczkowski used a different approach. Between November 2017 and February 2018 , he spent 90 days in a vehicle with a GPS logger armed with high-resolution cameras and video equipment. Covering 8,250km, he and colleagues counted and photographed lions. In this part of Africa, the lions have an unusual habit of spending the daytime in trees. Braczkowski used this daylight opportunity to photograph the lions’ “whisker pattern” – the places on the face where the whiskers emerge from the fur in a pattern that is unique to each cat. “We used the cinematic cameras to zoom in on the lion’s face but, actually, most cameras can do this,” he says. Using this method, observers can be more confident they are not counting the same animal twice. As well as providing a detailed record of each observed lion, the method also has the bonus of amassing hundreds of stunning close-ups of the animals. Braczkowski and colleagues hope this approach could be used more widely across Africa. He says it has already been rolled out systematically by the Kenyan government. “There’s a growth of emerging studies now showing there’s a better way. We’ve got the technology and the cameras and the science. We need to start using it.”"
"The first sign that our owl box was being used was the intermittent calling of a female tawny during the day. A male, occasionally hooting from the wood across the river, would sometimes be answered by her muted kee-wick. It is females alone that incubate eggs and stay with the chicks until they have fledged. Living so close to the house, she would be able to hear my feet on the gravel path, our voices and other everyday sounds. The nest box, a tall chimney shape suggesting a hollow tree trunk, has been fixed to the sycamore for a while now. It took some years for it to be accepted, but this is the third time it has been occupied. Hearing an alarmed flurry of small birds, I reached for my binoculars, and there was a female owl on a weathered sycamore branch, its surface scuffed and peeling from her sharp talons. The symmetry of her face resembled a vertical slice through an apple. Her feathers were a pattern of buff and light brown, like the shadows of leaves that float across a branch. For the next five days, I watched her from the kitchen window or glanced sideways at her as I gardened. I could weed nearby or pick bunches of flowers and she would stay where she and I could see each other. She had three favourite perches: the first easily visible, the second a bit more secluded and the third tucked deeper into an ash tree. When anyone else was nearby she would retreat to the innermost perch. Studies have shown that birds can recognise people’s faces, so perhaps she trusted my movements and gestures. I heard the peeping of an owlet, and there it was, standing on the front rim of the box, grey and fluffy. Later at dusk, it moved to a gate, motionless and staring. I watched from the window as the light dropped. Gradually it relaxed, stretched an exploratory wing, scratched among feathers. When the female landed alongside, barred wings against the pale field, she fed it a vole before flying off. The chick lifted a claw, rotated the prey and swallowed. I felt I had witnessed something very special."
"Australia’s peak mining body representing the coal industry has released a plan to tackle climate change across the industry, endorsing a goal of reaching net-zero emissions “as fast as possible” but without setting a target date. The Minerals Council of Australia’s chief executive, Tania Constable, claimed it was “possible and plausible for the coal industry to achieve near zero or net-zero emissions” by using carbon offsets and carbon capture and storage technologies. The council’s plan comes after two of its biggest members – Rio Tinto and BHP – faced concerted pressure from investors to leave the council over its backing of coal. MCA’s plan has been greeted with a mixture of cynicism, scorn and qualified acceptance from climate action groups, with some branding it “greenwashing”. The plan is a list of 30 activities underneath 10 action areas across its sector covering three issues; developing technology pathways to cut emissions, increasing transparency on climate change reporting, and knowledge sharing of the sector’s response to climate change. Constable said: “We can’t predict how long coal or any other mineral is going to last. Our job is to try and make sure that we are achieving a net-zero emissions outcome as fast as we possibly can. “This [plan] demonstrates our commitment in Australia to making sure we meet that effort to net zero emissions as rapidly as we can.” The MCA has been an influential voice on national debates on climate policy for many years and has been accused of consistently holding back action on climate change. The UN’s climate change panel has said that to limit global warming to 1.5C, global emissions should reach net zero by 2050. Constable said the plan was focused on the end goal of net-zero emissions “rather than get hung-up on a specific date”. Two of the MCA’s biggest members – Rio Tinto and BHP – have announced net-zero emissions targets for their own operations by 2050. One focus of the MCA’s plan is to drive companies to reduce emissions from their own operations within Australia, but this does not include any targets to reduce the production of thermal coal or to count the burning of that coal in other countries. “Coal is fundamental to the power industry at the moment in Australia and the strong demand of the Asia region in particular. The plan recognises that there’s an effort that needs to be made on coal,” Constable said. “The climate action plan is about the minerals sector and is not talking responsibility for every other sector. It’s about Australian minerals and what we are producing and does not take into account what’s happening with customers.” “With the use of carbon capture and storage and with offsets and international credit units, it’s possible and plausible for the coal industry to achieve near zero or net-zero emissions.” Constable claimed the plan was a “world first for the minerals sector” that she hoped would lead to a “reinvigorated sustainability agenda in Australia”. She said the emergence of electric vehicles domestically and at mine sites was seen as a “one of the great opportunities for the minerals sector”. She said: “When we look at the opportunities we need to think about about how we support the renewables industry and how we support the new types of uses for electric vehicles and low emissions technologies.” Resources companies have been targeted by campaigners and investors with shareholder resolutions, asking them to withdraw from industry associations whose goals and actions are not in line with the Paris climate change agreement. Constable said the “resolutions go away when you can demonstrate real commitment and real action.” “This is not a statement – it’s a clear action across a broad range of issues,” she added. Erwin Jackson, a policy director at the Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents institutional investors that manage more than $2tn in funds, said the statement was a step forward, but warned the “proof will be in the pudding”. In a submission to the government, the group said institutional investors over the next three years were focused on policy pathways that achieved net-zero emissions by 2050 and managed the energy sector transition. “Investors will continue to engage with mining companies on the role their industry associations play in driving a smooth transition to net-zero emissions by 2050,” Jackson said. “But the core issue is that the key barrier to driving affective action is government policy. How will the statement impact on the Minerals Council’s public advice to put policies in place to allow investors to invest in new technologies?” Climate campaign group 350 Australia described MCA’s plan as “meaningless” because it lacked “clear commitments to advocate for emissions reduction targets that will ensure we keep global warming below 1.5C or even dates by which we should hit net-zero emissions.” “There is now no excuse for any minerals company that claims to support the Paris agreement to remain a member of the Minerals Council.” The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), a pro-climate action group, said the MCA plan lacked tangible commitments on key issues including phasing out coal and reaching net-zero emissions. Dan Gocher, the group’s director of climate and the environment, said: “This is embarrassing and woefully inadequate: the MCA can’t even commit to net-zero emissions by any date. What type of plan is this without any dates or targets? “This ‘plan’ is the equivalent of a dead cat on the table – and a clear distraction from the mining industry’s cultural heritage woes.” “Investors will be sorely disappointed. Investors have given MCA member companies the benefit of the doubt that they could achieve change from within. This policy represents business as usual and further delays to action. Investors must call time on this farce.”"
"If I reach out my hand, the song thrush will hop closer. It will calmly accept a crumb, a seed or a half-grape from my fingers, or alight on them, gripping with toes that feel like electrical wire: not hard, but not quite soft; not warm, but not quite cool. “Alight” is very much the right word, because the wonder of mutually fearless physical contact with a wild songbird is akin to holding fire in my hand. At such close range, this is not just a song thrush, but a someone. Unlike the bandit confidence of quayside gulls, that of the song thrushes that populate Scilly at 10 times the density found on the mainland is inquiring and circumspect, almost polite. The house sparrows here are equally unafraid, but they operate in a crowd, making it hard to keep track of who’s who. The local swallows are, if not confiding (I have nothing they want or need), then insouciant. The lanes of St Agnes are narrow and sheltered between stone walls and hedges, and their concrete surfaces radiate heat well into the night. The birds barrel along these warm canyons, hoovering up insects that mistake the still air for safety. Walking of an evening it can feel as though you’ve strayed on to the wrong carriageway of a hirundine highway. They hurtle past at head height or lower, making the minimum correction necessary to avoid human bollards, but passing so close you can glimpse the Joker-gape and large eyes, sense air thrumming in feathers, and vortices flung in their wake. For a while, this holiday seemed too much to hope for and now the sense of mental decompression is palpable. While we pitch tents this afternoon, the children disappear, like four genies liberated into light and air. It’s only later that they show me where they’ve spent the afternoon – much further than we imagined they’d go unaccompanied: a natural rock fortress with giddy pinnacles, unnerving drops, tight caves and narrow crevices. They swarm over it like monkeys. Suppressing a reflexive and unnecessary urge to caution them, I recall the bird’s trusting grip on my finger. It’s easy to forget sometimes, perhaps most times, that fearing and being feared are not inescapable parts of being human."
"Instead of blaming protected newts for thwarting the “build build build” agenda, politicians and developers must incorporate green thinking into the design of new infrastructure, according to the chair of the government’s conservation watchdog. Natural England’s Tony Juniper called on the government and planners to change their thinking to ensure environmental considerations were designed into new housing estates, as well as road and rail projects, at the beginning, rather than being a hasty “add-on” or “mitigation” at the end. “When I hear ‘build build build’, I say ‘nature nature nature,’” said Juniper. “None of this should be controversial any longer because we’ve had a succession of reports telling us that healthy nature is an asset, not a burden. We need healthy nature to catch carbon, to clean up rivers, to reduce flood risk, to improve public health and wellbeing, to attract tourism. All of these have economic upsides, which I fear until relatively recently have been invisible in the development planning process.” Juniper, the former director of Friends of the Earth, who was appointed chair of Natural England by Michael Gove 18 months ago, took issue with the prime minister’s “build build build” speech in which Boris Johnson claimed “the newt-counting delays in our system are a massive drag on the productivity and prosperity of this country”. Juniper said the real problem was that developers seeking to reduce the environmental impact of housing or roads usually only considered how to do so after a project had been drawn up. He likened the planning system to the “end of pipe” approach to cleaning up pollution, with society belatedly realising it was better to use technology to prevent pollution at the start, rather than have an expensive cleanup at the end. “So it goes with built development,” said Juniper. “What we need to be doing is truly green, ecologically sustainable designs at the start then we wouldn’t have to have all that end of pipe stuff that is making so many people apparently frustrated, with newts being the icon of that.” Last month Johnson announced a new Project Speed taskforce led by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, with the aim of “scything through red tape” and delivering key infrastructure projects, such as new prisons, more quickly. The government’s environment bill, which is going through parliament, will enshrine a principle of “biodiversity net gain” with new development required to deliver an improvement in “biodiversity value” through, for instance, the creation of wildlife areas alongside new housing. It follows the government’s 25-year environment plan, which minister declared in 2018 would “leave the environment in a better state than we found it”. Some environmental campaigners criticise “net gain” for enabling protected or ancient wildlife habitats to be destroyed as long as developers create new habitat. Juniper said Natural England was seeking to “feed ideas into so-called Project Speed” to ensure the government and policymakers “lift up the ambition around net gain and put that into major infrastructure as well as housing”. For instance, he said net gain should apply to latter stages of HS2, which only pledges “no net loss” of biodiversity across its entire route. Asked if the government was hearing his message that environmental health was inextricably linked with the country’s wealth, Juniper said: “Government is a complex and multifaceted process and this sometimes takes some time to land these arguments.” He added: “We should have this more deeply embedded at the level of general understanding. If we are going to look to change the way we do development, hopefully this is the moment when we choose to do things differently.  “I don’t know exactly where different interests in government are on this in terms of the Department of Transport and the Housing Department but I’m very hopeful that over these coming months we will be able to shape the agenda, to build this in. The opportunity does seem to be there right now.  “If we’re going to say ‘build build build’, let’s just make sure we keep saying ‘nature nature nature.’”"
"Most councils issue less than one fine a week to litterers, according to data obtained via freedom of information rules, with one in six issuing no fines at all across a year. Enforcement varied widely, with a handful of the councils in England and Wales issuing more than 100 a week. Campaigners at Clean Up Britain said the level of littering was “shameful” and that enforcement of fines by councils should be made compulsory. They said the maximum on-the-spot fine of £150 was “derisory” and should be increased to £1,000. Littering has increased as more people have visited parks during the coronavirus pandemic, with councils each having to clear up an average of 57 tonnes of additional waste from April to July, according to a survey by Keep Britain Tidy (KBT). “The levels of litter and waste being left has reached unprecedented levels,” one council officer told KBT. Clean Up Britain received replies to their freedom of information (FOI) requests from 169 councils, representing more than half of councils in England and Wales. The majority – 56% – issued less than one litter fine a week and 16% issued no fines at all in the financial year 2018-19, the most recent year for which the FOI data is available. The London borough of Hounslow issued the most fines for littering, with 156 per week, and Bristol council was second, with 151 a week. Four other London boroughs were in the top 10 – Merton, Camden, Bexley and Wandsworth. The Wirral, Wolverhampton and Doncaster councils also issued more than 80 litter fines a week But Harrogate, Stevenage, Bridgend, Derbyshire Dales and South Somerset councils were among those issuing no litter fines at all, while Chorley and King’s Lynn and West Norfolk councils issued a single fine and Stratford-on-Avon council issued two. Cornwall council, which runs a #LitterlessCornwall campaign also issued two fines in 2018-19. In total, the councils issued 116,000 fines for littering, compared with 2.3m fines for parking offences. “It’s depressing, shameful and embarrassing what a dump this country has become,” said John Read, the founder of Clean Up Britain. The 2017 National Litter strategy from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was a series of “incoherent, ineffective and uninspiring initiatives”, he said. “Litter is a complex issue and there is no single silver bullet,” Read said. “However, it is very important to have an effective and punitive deterrent and that is totally lacking in Britain.” The maximum on-the-spot fine for littering increased from £80 to £150 in 2018, but Read said that was a derisory figure and should be raised to £1,000. In February, the thinktank Bright Blue called for the fine to be raised to £500. Merle van den Akker, the president of the behavioural insights team at Warwick Business School, backed Read’s call for a £1,000 fine: “This is how you get people to pay attention and take action. No one wants to be fined £1,000 for throwing away a £1 can of drink.” A Defra spokeswoman said: “Littering blights communities, spoils our countryside and poses a risk to people’s health, which is why councils have legal powers to take enforcement action.” Offenders who fail to pay the on-the-spot fines can be prosecuted and fined up to £2,500 and the spokeswoman said there were 22,699 such convictions in 2019, though this was a fall of 23% on 2018. The government has no plans to increase the on-the-spot fines, she said. “Clearly it is a concern if some local authorities don’t ensure some level of enforcement on littering,” a spokeswoman for KBT said. “However, most have been subject to substantial budget cuts since 2010. Ultimately we need to urgently move away from our current single-use [packaging] culture.” She said KBT ran training courses for council officers in effective and proportionate enforcement and would support magistrates making greater use of the £2,500 maximum court penalty. Councillor Darren Rodwell, at the Local Government Association, said: “Councils are working hard to keep parks, streets and public spaces free from litter. Responsibility for litter lies with the person dropping it. [Fines] are a useful tool but on their own will not stop littering.” Councillor Dan Humphreys, at the District Councils’ Network, said: “Our aim is to work with communities to promote positive behaviour. It can also be very difficult or in some cases impossible to track down perpetrators, which is why councils need the public’s cooperation to help keep our communities litter-free.” A spokesman for Cornwall council said: “#LitterlessCornwall is designed to change people’s behaviours to prevent littering. I believe this has had a positive impact.” He said the council had more trained officers than ever before who were authorised to tackle littering. The FOI requests also obtained data on fines imposed for dog fouling, with councils issuing just six fines for dog fouling per year on average, apart from Woking, which imposed 60% of the all the fines, equivalent to 30 a week. There were also few fines for graffiti, with 114 in total across all councils, dominated by Tower Hamlets in London with 49, and few for flyposting, with Cardiff issuing half the total of 1,063."
"From a “mile-long” swarm in Devon to warnings to swimmers in the Outer Hebrides, it seems jellyfish are difficult to ignore this summer. High temperatures, calm and warm seas and packed beaches have resulted in large numbers of reports of jellyfish blooms around the UK coast, and combined with a glut of the plankton on which they feed, some are reaching record sizes, experts said. At the fishing town of Brixham, Devon, one kayaker and photographer witnessed what he described as a mile-long mass of compass jellyfish. They have also been spotted in large numbers along the Cornish coast. “They are very beautiful, with amazing markings, a whiteish jellyfish with black stripes running from the centre to the outside of their umbrella,” said Matt Slater of the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. “And really long tentacles, which can impart a sting. It hurts a bit but the pain dies off in about ten minutes.” At the other end of the country, swimmers off the Isle of Lewis have had to contend with a group of lion’s mane jellyfish, which have a very nasty sting. Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a Sherlock Holmes short story in which one was responsible for a mysterious death. “We would ask people to keep away from this type of jellyfish and not touch them,” the Stornaway coastguard said. Galway city council in Ireland issued a similar warning after the same species was spotted at Silverstrand beach. It advised swimmers to be extremely vigilant and to approach a lifeguard for assistance if stung. The common moon jellyfish has been abundant in Devon, while in north-east England Sunderland city council issued a warning to swimmers and dog walkers after large numbers of blue jellyfish washed up on Seaburn beach. Coral Smith, a marine education officer at Devon Wildlife Trust, said: “This year the compass jellies have been very big, up to their maximum of about 30 centimetres. That’s unusual.” She credits this to plentiful plankton and the warmer weather. “And nice calm waters means they stick around. They are not getting washed out to sea again.” Dr Victoria Hobson, a lecturer in marine ecology at Exeter University and a jellyfish expert, believes it is not an exceptional year for jellyfish blooms, but rather that the creatures are more visible. “The weather’s been really lovely and it’s been quite calm, so better to see them. It’s been gloriously warm, and they like to come up to bask nearer the surface,” she said. With furlough, and staycations, “more people are out on the water, so a lot more eyes looking”. Blooms come and go. One year one species will be abundant, the next another. “Blooms are caused by jelly fish polyps living on the sea bed feeding on plankton,” said Slater. “If there is plentiful food they will get fat and bud off into thousands of tiny baby jellyfish. You get huge swarms travelling and drifting in the ocean currents, and hoping they never end up on a beach.” The advice to swimmers who have been stung is to scrape off any remaining tentacles using something similar to a credit card, and not to rub the area. They should rinse it with warm sea water, but avoid fresh water because it can cause further irritation. They should also be alert to the possibility of anaphylactic shock. They should not urinate on the affected area. “That’s the old wives tale, but it doesn’t work for all jellyfish and it’s very embarrassing,” said Slater. “And if you’ve been stung by a portuguese man o’war it’s the worst thing you can do. It makes the pain ten times worse.” Though not a true jellyfish, the portuguese man o’war is sometimes found in UK waters in late summer and early summer. It has a sting powerful enough to kill fish and occasionally even humans."
"Cows are waiting in pens, on sweet-smelling fresh straw. They have come to Lebanon from Spain, from Romania. In the one end of the alley are two pens packed with enormous Brahman cattle, standing well over six feet with their distinctive humps, all the way from Brazil. “They are the most aggressive,” says one of the slaughterhouse staff. “It’s just their personalities.” As the Beirut traffic continues its usual honking chaos outside, the animals wait to be slaughtered. When the time comes they go, one at a time, through the hatch into the gleaming tiled kill room. “They don’t see each other being killed,” says our guide. They are put on a hoist and tugged up by their legs, and then their throat is slit. There is no stunning here: the cattle is slaughtered according to the rules of halal, which in most interpretations means that the animal should be conscious when it dies. The floor glistens with water; it is washed down between each kill so the animals can’t smell the blood, although they may notice the carcasses of their brethren, dangling from hoists around them. The killing must be quick and well done, says one slaughterhouse employee, in his early twenties. He doesn’t like to think about what he does, he says. But it’s a job. The reputation of slaughterhouses in the Middle East is poor among animal welfare campaigners. Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farmings says that in his 28-year career “there is nothing I have seen as awful as slaughterhouses” in the Middle East. Investigation after investigation has exposed filthy conditions, little or no concern for animal welfare, badly trained staff, and, above all, the practice of halal slaughter, which often means animals are killed without being stunned first. Live animal exports to the Middle East have risen steadily over the past two decades, particularly from Europe. Trade to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia has risen steeply over the last fifteen years. In just one year, Turkey went from importing $600m (£457m) worth of animals in 2016 to $1.2bn in 2017. There are a number of reasons for the rise, but it is mainly due to an increasing demand for meat and dairy products, and rapidly warming climate pressuring water-stressed nations. Those nations that can afford the political or financial cost are increasingly looking to avoid rearing animals from birth, the more water-intensive option. As growing populations continue to demand freshly-killed, Middle Eastern nations are increasingly leaning on live imports to meet this need, and reshaping the global marketplace in the process. It’s a region where meat is often seen as a status symbol of a family’s ability to provide, and serving meat to a hungry guest is considered a demonstration of hospitality and generosity. The Islamic high holiday Eid al-Adha – which translates as festival of sacrifice, honouring the biblical figure Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his only son – requires that families slaughter a live animal, often a cow, sheep or goat, and distribute the meat between family, friends and neighbours, and the needy. The Middle East’s growing middle class has also swelled demand, along with overall population growth. “We’ve seen a significant increase in the middle class bracket across the Middle East over the last two decades,” says Emily Hawthorne, from private global intelligence firm Stratfor. “There’s the status symbol that comes from a live sheep – or better yet, a live cow or goat – for Eid al-Adha, as well as for weddings and festivals; the growth of the Middle Eastern middle class has a lot to do with this. This, for example, is why you see Gulf countries playing a huge part [in] live imports from Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan.” Australia recently enacted a three-month ban on live exports to the Middle East, after a furore over animal welfare concerns. But when one exporting country pulls back, others step forward. “In the midst of a growing demand from Qatar, the UAE, Kuwait and other Gulf countries for Eid al-Adha, [other] countries supplement gaps in supply,” says Hawthorne, listing India, Pakistan and Iran as potential live exporters willing to step in when Australia and other big exporters bail out. “Live export is a thing where you see – political proclivities aside – people need to import what communities [are] demanding,” she says. Ironically, the warming climate also plays a role in the trade: the lack of water across the Middle East means that it is cheaper to import animals rather than raise them from birth. Dairy cows, a popular import from America and Germany, drink 30–50 gallons of water per day, with high-producing ones consuming even more. Cattle reared for meat consume slightly less water, but the overall amount is enough to encourage water-scarce countries to look for ways to shorten the amount of time they have to care for the animals, while reaping the benefits for their meat industries. “The water shortage in the Gulf is profound and will only get worse as the population increases,” says Hawthorne. “The reality is that they cannot support water-intense livestock and agriculture on the ground. This means the time you hold livestock is important. As it’s expensive, you can only hold them for a temporary period.” A US official with knowledge of the Middle Eastern agriculture industry says countries across the region routinely import beef cattle six months before they are due to be slaughtered, a period in an animal’s life when it requires cheaper feed. Crucially, rearing an animal only in its final stage of life also cuts down on water consumption, a key advantage for water-scarce nations in the Gulf and across north Africa. “Sudan is the largest single supplier of live animals – mostly cows – to Egypt,” they explain, as an example. In Egypt, where the government has placed a premium on local beef, producers import cows at 12-months old, raising them for a final six months before slaughter in order to save on water and the expensive nutrient-rich feed the animals need earlier in life. “Egyptian beef farmers can then sell at market and say their product is Egyptian beef. But in terms of Sudanese water and feed – Egypt saves on those resources,” the official adds. This bait-and-switch tactic could also benefit authorities’ claims to be helping local producers. “There are many programmes to expand domestic animal production. By importing animals grown in Sudan, rearing them for six months then selling them as Egyptian beef, the government can say: ‘look we’re helping Egyptian farmers’,” the official explains. But as the trade grows, the issues around management and oversight of slaughterhouses in the region become more pressing. A 2014 investigation by Compassion in World Farming with Animals Australia allegedly uncovered footage of animals exported from the EU being violently handled in abattoirs in the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, including being dragged into position by their tails and even eye sockets. “Criticism of slaughter standards in the Middle East is not a disparagement of their religion,” says Stevenson. “Whenever Muslims see our films they are horrified and say ‘this is not halal’. Traditional religious slaughter calls for one clean cut which severs all of the major blood vessels so the animal loses blood and dies quickly, but in reality animals often receive many stabs and cuts to the throat before losing consciousness … in the slaughterhouse we’ve seen they don’t know how to handle cattle, they’re frightened of them.” Change is underway, however. In Turkey, steady work by Eyes On Animals and other groups has led to the acceptance of the use of stun guns in some abattoirs, and in October last year Ismailağa Cemaati, the largest Islamic group in the country, publically announced that stunning animals prior to killing them is acceptable and halal.

"Ingrid Albion has been helping to save whales and dolphins for three decades, but has never seen anything on a scale like this before. Nobody in Australia has. Within the rugged beauty of Macquarie Harbour, a wild Southern Ocean frontier on the remote Tasmanian west coast, she has witnessed the biggest disaster of its kind in this part of the world. Sometime overnight last Sunday, hundreds of long-finned pilot whales had become stranded in three spots inside and outside the harbour. Albion, a marine biologist and education officer with the state’s parks and wildlife service, was one of the first responders. She found marooned whales thrashing about on a shallow sandbar just inside the heads, not far from the entrance known as Hells Gates, and lined up along a nearby ocean beach. Distressingly, those inside the harbour were accompanied by their young offspring, known as calves. Small enough to avoid being beached, they circled the area singing out for their mothers and swimming up to the rescuers to bump their legs. It made for an overwhelming scene. “As much as humans can understand, they’re definitely calling out to each other and it sounds like reassuring each other,” Albion says, as she clutches a cup of hot tea after recovering from an eight-hour day in the water. “It really was a chaotic event, and if it’s your first time [at a mass stranding], there’s so many emotions. There’s dead whales, there’s live whales, there’s thrashing, there’s babies calling – there is a lot going on. “It’s not like people start crying, but you can just feel that people are really bonding with that whale. You’re sometimes with those whales for a couple of hours … and it is like having an animal’s life in your own hands.” Nobody is sure what brought the pilot whales in through Hell’s Gates. What is known is the alarm was raised in a phone call to police by a local early on Monday morning. An initial estimate suggested there were about 70 whales stranded, but that quickly increased to 270 after assessments from the water and air revealed members of the pod were spread across three locations. By the end of Monday, marine conservation teams and volunteers were arriving from across the state, ready to launch a rescue campaign at first light on Tuesday. By Wednesday, when roughly 200 carcasses were found adrift in the vast harbour’s tannin-stained waters and the death toll had leapt to about 380, it was clear this was Australia’s largest mass whale stranding on record, and among the worst recorded anywhere. On Thursday, rescuers were focused on the diminishing number of survivors, racing to get as many back out through the heads using a technique involving harnesses attached to the side of small boats. Meanwhile, there was the issue of the carcasses, which could deoxygenate the harbour as they decomposed, suffocating local species, and attracting sharks through Hell’s Gates. By Friday, the death toll was confirmed, including five that were too weak to be saved and had to be euthanised by gunshot. But there was also good news: 94 whales had been rescued, far more than authorities had expected at the start of the week. Kris Carlyon, a government wildlife biologist, says it was an “absolutely fantastic” result given how much worse it could have been. “On Monday, as we were trying to come up with plans, if we’d said we’ll get 90 off the bar we would have been happy.”  Albion’s first job early on Tuesday was to tackle the whales at ocean beach. As the wind gusted and the rain fell, her first impression was that the 30 or so along the shore were already lost. “We were driving the beach thinking we were looking at a group of dead whales but as we came to about whale number 10 it was lifting its head up,” she says. “That creates in you a sort of sense of ‘oh, I can do something, I can make a difference here’.” Over the next few hours, as a team of about 20 worked to save a handful of surviving beached whales. Others focused on the hundreds stranded in up-to chest deep water on the sandbar, an operation that would continue for days. For those in the water, the most urgent job was to right and stabilise the whales’ bodies, which can weigh up to three tonnes, to prevent them drowning. For those on the beach, it was to cool the animals by covering them with towels and slide mats beneath their bellies so they could be hoisted onto a trailer and driven to a release point from where they could swim back to the ocean. Though a global beaching hotspot, Tasmania has not had a major episode for more than a decade. Albion first experienced a mass whale stranding and rescue in New Zealand about 30 years ago. For the past 25 years she has been responsible for training Tasmanian government staff and volunteers using inflatable dummy whales. For many, this was their first experience of the real thing. “There’s a little bit of excitement and I think a lot of people felt overwhelmed because there were so many whales on the beach, but when you start focusing on a whale everyone’s just working together,” she says. The rescue team across the week totalled about 100, including scientists, fish farmers, government officials and surf lifesavers. The mood late this week was a mix of exhaustion and sadness, but also quiet satisfaction at what had been achieved. Some described the heartbreaking scene of freed whales being ushered towards the heads only to turn in response to a cry from another member of the pod and strand themselves again. About 10 of those ferried out beyond the heads re-beached themselves overnight on Thursday. For Tony van den Enden, chief executive of Surf Lifesaving Tasmania and overseeing a rotating team of about 40 volunteers, the rescue operation was an emotional rollercoaster – at once distressing and exhilarating. “It’s surreal,” he says after returning from the sandbar on Thursday. “You’re obviously seeing how gentle and large these creatures are, and while they are in so much distress they almost seem to know you’re trying to help. “To be able to help when they are so vulnerable is humbling in a way, but also gives a sense that you’re trying to make a difference.” But the scene at Macquarie Heads late on Friday remained undeniably grim. Seven more whales had been freed, but the view from the boat ramp was sobering: a sandbar turned into a makeshift morgue, with scores of lifeless bodies half-submerged across the sandbank. Scientists said it was unclear what had drawn them into the harbour, but there was no suggestion it was anything other than a natural tragedy. Pilot whales are an ocean going species that – despite their name - are a member of the dolphin family. They travel in large pods and are prone to mass strandings when they get too close to shore. Feedback from the coastline can play havoc with their echolocation – clicks and other sounds they use to communicate and orient themselves when swimming in a pod, or chasing fish deep in the ocean. Theories included this pod may have come unusually close to the shore to feed before getting into trouble. Authorities were still weighing what to do with the bodies, but leaning towards an ocean disposal – dragging them out past the heads and slicing through their blubber to help them sink. As for the survivors, it was hoped they may reform into a smaller pod and avoid a repeat stranding. “Ideally they will re-group,” Carlyon says. “They will reform those bonds and get on with things. This is obviously a stressful event for them. But we’re hopeful.”"
"There are some birds I would never expect to see in my Somerset village. Magnificent frigatebird. Superb bird-of-paradise. Wandering albatross. And white-tailed eagle. Except that, for a couple of days this winter, a juvenile white-tailed eagle – Britain’s biggest bird of prey – did turn up here in our quiet country parish. OK, it wasn’t a truly wild bird. It had drifted over to Somerset from the Isle of Wight, where it had been released last summer as part of an exciting project to reintroduce these mighty raptors into southern England. Nevertheless, it had flown all the way here on its winter wanderings; and for me, that was good enough. Many of my neighbours noticed the bird too, with the village website buzzing excitedly with the news. The eagle mostly perched in a tree less than a mile from my home, staying surprisingly inconspicuous, given its 2.5 metre wingspan. From time to time it would drop down to the ground, perhaps feeding on a dead sheep or rabbit. Then, on a bright Sunday morning, it left, heading slowly back south and east, towards its new home. The whole event, for me, summed up the joyous unpredictability of birding – wherever you live, you never know what to expect."
"Japan’s traditional carmaking giants need to raise their game in the race to develop pure, battery-driven electric vehicles or risk being left behind by Chinese, American and European producers, analysts have warned. Despite dominating car production in Asia for decades, Japan’s big players have been slow to fully develop the battery-only technology that is now eclipsing hybrid vehicles as the most likely type of car to plug petrolheads into the automotive revolution. Battery technology and government policies to phase out petrol vehicles are driving the change away from hybrids towards a market worth billions of dollars in potential new sales. Breakthroughs mean that new models such as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 have a socket on the side of the car that can be used to power household appliances. The next step is a car battery that acts as your domestic power storage unit and feeds power back into the grid. Big tech companies such as Foxconn and Huawei are considering making EVs as they become as much about electronics as transport. Tesla topped the table for worldwide sales of plug-in electric vehicles last year, according to Statista, with more than 500,000 cars. Volkswagen was a distant second, followed by the Chinese market leader BYD. No Japanese manufacturers made the top 10. Last year, fewer than 15,000 battery electric vehicles (BEVs) were sold in Japan, or less than 1% of overall car sales. Toyota-owned Daihatsu, which has the fourth largest share of the market by domestic sales, does not make any compact EVs. By contrast sales in Germany, where Volkswagen is leading the charge towards battery-only cars, the figure was 6.9%, while Britain is close behind with a market share for BEVs of 6.6% last year. In China, where 25m cars are sold every year, the share taken by BEVs was 5%. The market share will only grow as these countries phase out petrol vehicles as well as hybrids. Although Japan says it wants to phase out petrol and diesel cars by the mid-2030s and is a powerhouse producer of hybrid cars, consumers have a limited choice when it comes to BEVs. The government also faces pushback from the boss of Toyota who said last year that “the current business model of the car industry is going to collapse” if the government moved too quickly. Toyota has no plans to mass produce a BEV vehicle until 2025 although it is also developing fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) which run on hydrogen. Bakar Sadik Agwan, senior automotive consulting analyst at GlobalData, a leading research and consulting company based in India, said Japanese manufacturers in particular needed to raise their game. Tesla recently reduced the cost of Model 3 in Japan in a direct challenge to local producers such as Toyota, Honda and Mazda, he said, who are also facing competition from Chinese cars and South Korea’s Hyundai. “Several global manufacturers do not have a strong BEV portfolio,” he said. “Though the global manufacturers have not aggressively launched BEVs, most of them are investing in research & development as well as strategic alliances. Unless governments discourage the purchase of conventional vehicles, the demand for such vehicles would continue to be strong in the medium term.” Another analyst, Shaun Rein of CMR based in Shanghai, went further and suggested that manufacturers such as Toyota faced an existential threat from its Chinese and South Korean competitors if it could not develop pure electric technology. “Toyota and some of these other companies could go out of business if they don’t wake up,” he said, pointing to commitments by producers such as Ford and Volvo – owned by China’s Geely corporation – to only sell electric vehicles in Europe by the end of the decade. Toyota says it aims to reduce vehicle CO2 emissions by 90% in comparison with 2010 levels by 2050 and, to this end, is working on a a range of electrified vehicles – including hybrid, plug-in hybrid (PHEV), BEVs and FCEVs. But the competition from state-backed players is fierce. Although Tesla is still the technological leader worldwide, especially on batteries, China wants to become stronger in this key market through companies such as Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and BYD. China is also highly motivated to convert drivers to BEVs because it needs to reduce pollution in its mega-cities, Rein said. To achieve this goal, it plans to increase the EV share of new car sales to 20% by 2025 and at least half of all sales by 2035. In order to persuade consumers to go fully electric cities such as Shanghai are mandating charging points in all residential developments and shopping malls. This month the city’s authorities made it free to obtain special licence plates for BEVs and will withdraw the concession for hybrids in 2023 to ensure more take-up of the zero-emission cars. It is already expensive and time-consuming to obtain a licence for an internal combustion engine (ICE) car. Other Asia Pacific countries are using government policy to aggressively drive the uptake of all different types of electric vehicles, although Australia remains an outlier as some states plan to increase rather than decrease taxes on electric vehicles. In South Korea, the government is collaborating with manufacturers to try to bring down the high cost of EVs, a factor still seen as the biggest disincentive to buyers. The aim is also to produce cars with a greater driving range thus overcoming the other major downside for would-be owners worried about running out of power on longer journeys. Hyundai’s one-size-fits-all platform, which enables it to design all its EVs around the same basic structure, is seen as the template. Thailand, which is projected to make 2m cars this year and is the 11th largest car producing country in the world, has pledged that 30% of output will be EVs by 2030. Singapore will not allow the registration of diesel vehicles after 2025, it said this month, which will mainly affect the city-state’s taxi fleet. It aims to eliminate combustion engines by 2040."
"Fewer than 1% of Australian manufacturing jobs are in gas-intensive industries that would materially benefit from a massive gas industry expansion proposed by the Morrison government, according to an upcoming analysis. A report by the Grattan Institute, to be released in November, examines the number of manufacturing businesses and jobs across the country that are heavily reliant on gas. Its results contradict a suggestion by Scott Morrison that gas could be central to plans to re-establish a strong economy after the coronavirus recession. In a speech in the Hunter Valley on Tuesday, the prime minister announced $52.9m for plans to increase gas supply and transportation infrastructure, and issued an ultimatum to electricity generators, warning taxpayers would build a gas power plant if the private sector did not. Morrison said a gas expansion would be particularly important for the manufacturing sector, which he said employed more than 850,000 Australians. He quoted a gas industry estimate that 225,000 manufacturing jobs were in industries that relied heavily on gas and needed a cheap, reliable supply. The Grattan Institute, a Melbourne-based thinktank, found about two-thirds of the gas used in manufacturing was consumed at just 15 facilities that together employ just over 10,000 people. Gas was found on average to make up at least 10% of the input costs at those facilities, where it is used as a feedstock and fuel source to make plastics, alumina and products based on ammonia and other chemicals. They are owned by just nine companies, including Qenos, Rio Tinto, Alcoa, Orica and Incitec Pivot. Across the rest of the manufacturing sector the cost of gas was found to be less than 0.5% of total inputs. Guy Dundas, an energy fellow with the institute, said nearly 6,000 of the manufacturing jobs that were heavily reliant on gas already had an affordable supply as they were based in Western Australia, where the price was about $4 a gigajoule – roughly half that being offered in contracts on the east coast. He said there were only between 4,000 and 5,000 jobs in heavily gas-reliant manufacturing in the east, which was a focus of the prime minister’s announcement. Tony Wood, the Grattan Institute’s energy director, said the analysis showed the idea the government could stimulate a gas-led recovery was “unlikely at several levels”. “Gas prices are unlikely to be very low again, and even if they were low they would not create serious economic stimulus because seriously gas-reliant industries don’t employ many people,” he said. Wood noted the jobs lost during the recession were largely in retail, entertainment and hospitality, not energy and manufacturing, and said a gas expansion would require the government to back the sort of proposals recommended in a leaked draft report by a manufacturing taskforce, including significant taxpayer underwriting of new gas infrastructure and involvement in developing gasfields. “Even if the government is prepared to subsidise the entire industry, that would have limited impact. That would seem an extraordinary proposition, and it doesn’t seem to be going down that path,” Wood said. He said the economic argument against a major gas expansion was also undermined by the trend towards adopting cheaper clean energy. Gas has about half the carbon dioxide emissions of coal when burned, but its impact on the climate is greater once leakage of methane, a relatively short-lived but highly potent greenhouse gas, is factored in. The government’s gas strategy includes the option of taxpayer underwriting for priority gas projects and the construction of a gas power station in the Hunter Valley if the private sector failed to replace the ageing Liddell coal plant in 2023. Morrison last week said the government estimated “some 1,000 megawatts” of new dispatchable electricity was needed to keep prices down after Liddell’s closure, but on Sunday he gave the ABC an updated estimate of “about 250 MW, or thereabouts”. Analysis released by the government has not included either estimate. The idea of a gas-led recovery has been championed by the government’s business advisers, including Nev Power, the former Fortescue executive, and Andrew Liveris, a former Dow Chemical executive and current Saudi Aramco board member. In a speech last week, Liveris declared Australia could hit net zero emissions by 2050 by significantly expanding supply and use of gas even though it would release heat-trapping emissions. Liveris compared the opportunity to develop gas in Australia with that in the US, where fracking for shale gas has led to a comparatively cheap supply. Wood said there was little evidence gas prices would stay low in Australia, or that lower prices would drive an expansion of manufacturing. Manufacturing was not expanding on the Australian east coast before prices rose significantly last decade, and manufacturing businesses were not substantially investing in Western Australia now, despite low prices there. Gas prices on the east coast roughly tripled for some users, from about $4 to about $12 a gigajoule, after an export hub opened in Queensland in 2014. About three-quarters of the gas produced is sold overseas and the domestic gas price has been effectively set by the Asian market. A recent report by the consumer watchdog said there was evidence some contract prices for 2021 had fallen to less than $7 in Queensland and between $7 and $8 in southern states, but many business were still buying gas for between $9 and $11, more than twice the historic price. Dundas said the report would also make clear gas basins being considered for development on the east coast contained a dry type of gas that was not suitable for many types of manufacturing that had increased in the US in recent years. The Narrabri gasfield in New South Wales and the Bowen and Galilee basins in Queensland contained little ethane, which is an important feedstock in complex chemical processes to create plastics. It would be suitable for production of ammonia-based fertilisers and explosives."
"Support is growing internationally for a new global treaty to tackle the plastic pollution crisis, it has emerged, though so far without the two biggest per capita waste producers – the US and the UK – which have yet to signal their participation. A UN working group on marine litter and microplastics met at a virtual conference last week to discuss the issue. More than two-thirds of UN member states, including African, Baltic, Caribbean, Nordic and Pacific states, as well as the EU, have declared they are open to considering the option of a new agreement. The treaty would be akin to the Paris climate agreement or the Montreal protocol to prevent ozone depletion. Neither the UK nor the US have declared their desire for a new agreement. Britain, which leaves the EU at the end of the year, is considering one of two options: to support increasing calls for negotiating a new global treaty, or to strengthen existing agreements to reduce plastic waste. A decision by Zac Goldsmith, a minister for the environment, is understood to be imminent. The US has so far opposed an international agreement on plastic waste. The UN environment assembly, which set up the ad hoc working group (AHEG) on marine plastics in 2017, concluded that the existing international legal framework governing plastic pollution, including the Stockholm and the Basel conventions, is fragmented and ineffective. The flow of plastic into the ocean is expected to triple by 2040 if current trends continue, up to 29m tonnes a year – the equivalent of 50kg for every metre of coastline in the world. All efforts made and announced so far to curb plastic waste are expected to reduce the volume by only 7%. Once in the sea, it breaks down into microplastics, to be ingested by marine life. Political momentum for a global agreement to address the full lifecycle of plastic has been growing, with several high-level ministerial declarations in favour. Earlier this month, a resolution calling for the world community to agree to a binding global agreement was adopted by International Union for the Conservation of Nature members, and 2 million people have signed a petition calling for one to be adopted. At last week’s fourth and final meeting of the AHEG group, which will feed into UNEA’s 5th conference in 2021 and 2022, many delegates expressed concern that the crisis was being exacerbated by excess plastic pollution linked to personal protective equipment necessary to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Several delegations voiced support of a new global agreement, although there was no consensus on whether it would only address marine plastic litter or go further to tackle plastics pollution as a whole and if it would be legally binding. Ayub Macharia, the director of the National Environment Agency in Kenya, said the world required a global agreement to protect a “common heritage, our planet Earth”. He told delegates: “Kenya is on record in issuing a ban on polythene bags in 2017 and in single use plastic bags in protected areas in 2019.” Without international backup, however, Kenya’s actions alone did not reduce waste, Macharia said, declaring that “because of our porous borders which allow the illegal trafficking of plastic,” it was merely pushed across Kenya’s borders to other countries. Some industries that manufactured plastic bags in Kenya simply migrated to neighbouring countries, he said. Roxanne Blesam, chief executive officer of Palau’s environmental quality protection board, said the republic joined the “overwhelming majority of AHEG experts who have indicated support for a binding global agreement”, and supported a proposition put forward by the EU for an intergovernmental negotiating committee to start work on it. Hugo-Maria Schally, head of the multilateral environmental cooperation unit at the European commission, claimed the EU had been a proponent of a stronger global framework to address marine litter and marine plastic pollution for some time, and that the lack of participation so far by the US remained a huge obstacle. “We see moves by the US to come to some kind of understanding, but I’m not sure that the difficulties can be bridged,” Schally said. Many NGOs believe that an international agreement is the only viable option to tackle plastic waste. One model for such a treaty, drawn by the Environmental Investigations Agency (EIA), involves four key pillars: monitoring and reporting, to examine the extent of the problem; prevention; coordination; and technical and financial support, for example aid to developing countries. “Maintaining the status quo is not only untenable, it would have catastrophic implications for planet Earth,” said Christina Dixon, senior ocean campaigner at EIA. “It’s therefore heartening to see such growing convergence around a global and legally binding treaty to combat plastic pollution.” Tim Grabiel, senior lawyer at EIA, said: “Support for a global treaty on plastic pollution is a critical action that the Biden administration can take to correct the wrongs of the Trump era. Over the last four years, we have continually encountered opposition from the Trump administration to truly address plastic pollution, slowing down progress and watering down international efforts. We are hopeful that, with a change in leadership at the top, the US will join its allies and support a global treaty on plastic pollution at UNEA-5.” In the UK, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “We are working with partners across the Commonwealth to prevent plastic waste from reaching the ocean, and have committed to establishing a £500m ‘Blue Planet Fund’ that will support developing nations to protect the marine environment and reduce poverty.”"
"The Trump administration has announced it will lift protections in Alaska’s Tongass national forest, permitting logging in the world’s largest intact temperate rainforest. Experts call the Tongass the “lungs of the country” and one of nation’s last remaining bulwarks against climate change. Located on the southern coast of Alaska, it is made up of centuries-old western cedar, hemlock and Sitka spruce trees, and is home to immense biodiversity, including the largest-known concentration of bald eagles. “It’s ironic that this administration is trying to tout this president’s environmental record when [Trump is] unwinding environmental safeguards all over the place,” said Ken Rait, project director of the Pew Charitable Trust, who two decades ago helped win the protections that Donald Trump is now undoing. “And lifting protections on the Tongass, the nation’s flagship forest, is about the most egregious of all of them.” The administration’s decision ignores overwhelming public support for keeping protections in place on the Tongass, including resolutions from six south-east Alaska tribes and six south-east Alaska city councils against lifting protections. Of the public comments solicited on the plan, 96% were in favor of keeping protections in places. Tribes also petitioned the government to protect customary cultural use areas of the Tongass. “All other avenues to protect our homelands have been exhausted, to little avail,” they wrote in their petition. The Tongass has been safeguarded since 2001 by a “roadless rule”, which prohibits road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting in designated areas of national forests. It barred the construction of roads on some 58.5m acres, and in addition to the environmental benefits, the rule was motivated to protect US taxpayers from the costs of maintaining a web of US Forest Service roads “long enough to go to the moon and most of the way back with no way to maintain them”, said Rait. Tourism has soared, and the forest support some of the last productive wild salmon runs in the world, and a billion-dollar commercial fishing industry. A 2019 scientific analysis showed that the Tongass absorbs more carbon than any other national forest, on a level with the world’s most dense terrestrial carbon sinks in South America. After a brief private meeting between the president and the Alaska governor, Mike Dunleavy, aboard Air Force One in June 2019, Trump ordered his administration to lift all protections from the forest. According to Rait, “between taxpayer expenses and the fact that the majority of logs cut on the Tongass will be exported to China and other Pacific Rim nations, today’s decision isn’t going to have robust economic benefits to anyone in this country.” A recent report from the Center for Sustainable Economy documented taxpayer losses of nearly $2bn a year from federal logging programs, largely due to the fact that demand for timber has been flagging nationally. “The Tongass is America’s Amazon,” Adam Kolton, executive director of Alaska Wilderness League, said in a statement. “This presidentially directed move to gut roadless protections for our nation’s largest and most biologically rich national forest is a calamity for our climate, for wildlife and for the outdoor recreation economy of south-east Alaska.”"
"Hundreds of thousands of pigs have been culled by Nigerian farmers in response to an explosion of African swine fever (ASF). The outbreak began around Lagos and parts of neighbouring Ogun state earlier this year, pig farmers say, but has now spread to many other parts of the country. In the absence of official data, farmers who spoke to the Guardian estimated that nearly a million pigs had been put down so far. Mrs Bello, a farmer at Lagos-based Oke-Aro, the largest pig co-operative in west Africa, who preferred not to give her first name, said the co-operative alone had culled around 500,000 pigs. So far the virus has spread to more than a quarter of Nigeria’s 36 states. In the past decade, ASF has regularly surfaced in several parts of Africa. Between 2016 and 2019, more than 60­ outbreaks were reported across the continent. But the recent wave of infections is the worst by far. “We have never experienced anything of this scale in the past. This is the worst and largest outbreak ever,” says Ayo Omirin, a pig farmer at Oke-Aro, who has lost more than 600 of his 800 pigs. Another farmer, Lawrence Adeleke, who had been in the pig business for decades, recently died. The outbreak struck his farm in April, his son Adeleke Adedayo told the Guardian. Within two months, nearly all of the 100 or so pigs had died and the pens were shut down. In 2007, when a similar outbreak hit the farm, only three of nearly 100 pigs survived. “When he returned from the farm the day we lost the last set of pigs, he stopped talking to anybody for three days. He was always absent-minded and withdrawn,” said Adedayo. “He only spoke about the losses in the farm. He talked about all his labours for many years vanishing in a few days. He felt he was too old to start all over again. We all felt helpless. On the morning of 2 June, his birthday, he died.” The farmers who spoke to the Guardian estimated that the pig industry in the country has lost up to 20bn naira (£40m), and that more than 20,000 jobs are at risk. The outbreak comes at the same time as coronavirus, which has infected 17,148 people and led to 455 deaths, according to figures released by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. “A lot of pig farmers may not fully recover from their losses even in the next two years. Some farmers have left the industry already. At the moment, we have no clear picture of how the industry is going to bounce back,” said Omirin. In recent years, the popularity of pig farming has grown in Nigeria. It is seen as an escape from poverty for low-income households and is also popular with the expanding middle class. By 2009, the pig population had risen from 2 million in 1984 to over 7 million, according to figures from the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI). Numbers have probably doubled since then. The government has taken some action in the crisis, distributing bags of seed and fumigating infected pens. But farmers say this is rarely enough to see them through the rough road to recovery or offset their losses. “The government did nothing much,” said Bello, “when you consider that most farmers are now plunged into serious debts because of the loans they took to keep their farms.” ASF is harmless to humans but in pigs and wild boar the fatality rate is nearly 100%, and there is no vaccine against it. Safety depends on controlling animal movement and ensuring hygiene in farms, slaughterhouses and abattoirs. In Nigeria, many farms are not up to the task. “I suspect the outbreak started last year but the farmers were perhaps selling the infected pigs before it was noticed. This year the disease exploded,” said Dr Pam Luka, ASF researcher at the NVRI. “Activities like this only keep the virus circulating in the country in a cycle.”  A further problem comes from poor record keeping. According to Luka, local authorities rarely have any data for the outbreak. Figures kept by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), which should be notified of ASF cases, are significantly lower than the numbers quoted by farmers. OIE told the Guardian that they had received a notification about the recent outbreak on Tuesday. Nigeria currently has no database for issues related to animals and disease outbreaks, says Luka; he is currently working with the government to build one..  He is also working with other scientists to understand how the virus is transmitted among pig farms in Africa. But he believes that the situation will only improve when farmers are more proactive and local authorities intensify safety measures and support for the pig industry."
"“Pollinators were the key,” says Edgar Mora, reflecting on the decision to recognise every bee, bat, hummingbird and butterfly as a citizen of Curridabat during his 12-year spell as mayor. “Pollinators are the consultants of the natural world, supreme reproducers and they don’t charge for it. The plan to convert every street into a biocorridor and every neighbourhood into an ecosystem required a relationship with them.” The move to extend citizenship to pollinators, trees and native plants in Curridabat has been crucial to the municipality’s transformation from an unremarkable suburb of the Costa Rican capital, San José, into a pioneering haven for urban wildlife. Now known as “Ciudad Dulce” – Sweet City – Curridabat’s urban planning has been reimagined around its non-human inhabitants. Green spaces are treated as infrastructure with accompanying ecosystem services that can be harnessed by local government and offered to residents. Geolocation mapping is used to target reforestation projects at elderly residents and children to ensure they benefit from air pollution removal and the cooling effects that the trees provide. The widespread planting of native species underscores a network of green spaces and biocorridors across the municipality, which are designed to ensure pollinators thrive. “The idea came from a narrative that people in cities are prone to defending nature when it is far away, when it is a distant concept, but they are negligent when it comes to protecting nature in their immediate environment,” says Mora, who has since become a senior design strategist with the global architecture firm Gensler, after a brief spell as education minister. “Urban development should be, at least to some extent, aligned with the landscape instead of the other way round,” he says. The metropolitan area surrounding San José is home to more than 2 million people – about half of the population of Costa Rica – despite covering less than 5% of the country’s area. Were it not for the lush volcanic peaks that surround Costa Rica’s central valley, it would not be immediately obvious that you were in the heart of one of the most biodiverse countries on the planet. Humans dominate and the country’s cloud forests, pristine coastline and emblematic sloths can feel a long way from the concrete and traffic. “We attract a lot of tourists because of nature and conservation but there is still friction in the city,” says Irene Garcia, head of innovation at the mayor’s office in Curridabat, who oversees the Sweet City project. “Places like San José do not represent what we sell as a country or what you see in rural areas or the beaches. Costa Rica has differentiated itself significantly but our cities are a long way behind.” Urbanisation is one of the primary drivers of biodiversity loss around the world, according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), with urban areas having doubled since 1992. By the middle of the century, the UN projects that 68% of humanity will live in towns and cities, placing further pressure on ecosystems and rapidly vanishing habitats. But many urban planners are trying to change this relationship and the importance of green spaces in towns and cities has been recognised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature. Sweet City is just one of a number of biocorridors around the country that allow the genetic spread of species to maintain their strength. In Central America, this concept has developed since the early 2000s following an agreement to form a biocorridor network to connect jaguars. “Grey infrastructure makes the city warm up too much. So the idea to connect green areas is to cool down parts of the city, return the ecosystem services that were there previously but have deteriorated,” says Magalli Castro Álvarez, who oversees Costa Rica’s network of biocorridors with the National System of Conservation Areas (Sinac). “Inter-urban biocorridors have a double objective: they create ecological connectivity for biodiversity but also improve green infrastructure through roads and river banks lined with trees that are linked with the small forested areas that still exist in metropolitan areas. They improve air quality, water quality and give people spaces to relax, have fun and improve their health.” Many Costa Ricans are happy to speak about the policy benefits of schemes such as Sweet City , as their response to the challenges of bringing nature into the city is part of a deeper national sentiment. It is not in this tiny Central American country’s DNA to behave as if humans were somehow set apart from nature. It was a Costa Rican, Christiana Figueres, who brought the world together to reach the Paris agreement. More than 98% of Costa Rica’s energy comes from renewable sources and it plans to completely decarbonise by 2050 – one of the most ambitious goals on the planet. The country has also successfully reversed one of the world’s highest deforestation rates. “In Costa Rica, you can start your day in the Caribbean, in the Atlantic ocean, but then you can travel and on the same day, you can see the sun set in the Pacific,” says the country’s president, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, who credits Costa Rica’s tradition of pacifism and respect for nature with its desire to tackle big environmental issues. “Even though we have a small territory, its characteristics allow us to have 6% of the biodiversity of the world in our land. Those are traits that are special.  “I had to travel far away to understand that many of the answers were back home and the challenge was taking that legacy to the next level.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"Birdwatchers have been flocking to the boggy and desolate moors of the Peak District to try to spot a bearded vulture, one of the rarest birds ever seen in the UK, which has set up home on a remote cliff in the national park. This is only the second sighting of a bearded vulture in the UK, one of the largest and rarest raptors in Europe, and which was last seen in England in 2016. The bird is thought to be a juvenile with a wingspan of almost 3 metres and was first reported in the UK in late June, having being tracked from Belgium before arriving in the Peak District about two weeks ago. Birdwatcher Fred Fearn tweeted a video of the vulture eating bones on a rock. The birds are also also known as lammergeiers, which translates as “lamb killers” and refers to the false belief that the birds killed lambs and sheep. The vulture is a wild-hatched bird that originates from either the Alps or the Pyrenees, according to José Tavares, the director of the Vulture Conservation Foundation, which runs a bearded vulture reintroduction scheme across Europe. “It is common for young bearded vultures to leave the mountains and explore vast areas, but it is unusual for this species to cross over large bodies of water, which in this case was the English Channel,” Tavares said. “The bird will most likely attempt to return home in the future, but it is difficult to predict when or which route it will take.” Like all vultures, bearded vultures are scavengers but are unique in that they are the only bird to live on a diet made up almost exclusively of bones, meaning they pose no threat to farm animals or game birds. In the Peak District, the vulture has been seen feeding on the bones of a dead sheep. Birdwatchers planning on seeing the bird this weekend are being asked to ensure its safety. “We’re really excited that a rare bearded vulture has chosen to roost on National Trust land in the Peak District,” said Rachel Bennett, a National Trust ranger. “However, it’s vital that we all do everything we can not to disturb the bird while it is here. We want to make sure it’s protected and safe, as well as looking after the surrounding wildlife and other visitors, as well as our local community.” While the vulture is protected under EU law, there are fears for its future. “There are obvious concerns for the bird’s safety as it’s currently within the worst 10km square for raptor persecution in England, dominated by land used for driven grouse shooting,” said Mark Thomas, the head of investigations at the RSPB. “It’s great that the bird is effectively being protected by the admiring public and birdwatchers.” Tim Birch, from Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, believes the vulture’s presence in the uplands of the Peak District gives us a glimpse of what a wilder future could look like. He said: “Much of our charismatic wildlife remains missing from the Peak District national park including pine martens and hen harriers along with healthy populations of peregrines and goshawks. We will all benefit along with wildlife when our national parks and the environment becomes wilder.”"
"The Ordnance Survey app on my phone tells me where I am, but I’m finding the question of when I am trickier. In travelling 250 miles south to a south-western suburb of London, I’ve hopped almost two weeks forward in the schedule of blossom, bulb and birdsong, and 170 years back in the company I’m keeping. The first morning, I heard my first song thrush, mistle thrush and blackbirds of the year, saw blackthorn, primrose and alkanet in flower. But at Worcester Park there’s no sign now of the farm where members of the young pre-Raphaelite brotherhood spend an idyllic summer in 1851, capturing rural settings en plein air with tiny brushes and obsessive attention to nature’s detail – rejecting nothing, selecting nothing, and scorning nothing. Back then, the route I’m walking now – part unadopted road, part footpath – was an avenue of elms that led downhill to Malden. The trees are gone. The farmhouse is gone, the ivy-covered door William Holman Hunt used as a setting for The Light of the World and the wall where John Everett Millais set A Huguenot have also gone. Having read of these locations in their lively diaries, I’m almost as disorientated by the urbanisation that has have engulfed their idyll as they might be. At the crest of the hill, though, there’s a swatch of open amenity land with a view just expansive enough to let me imagine the rolling Surrey landscape this used to be. The wind remembers – it romps around this precious acre like a rambunctious puppy. Near the bottom of the hill, close to the spot on the Hogsmill river where Millais painted the background for his drowning Ophelia, is a brick and flint church both artists would recognise. I pause under a huge holm oak by the lychgate that looks easily old enough to span the intervening decades. Straggly catkins in luminous yellow shimmying at the tips of the branches acknowledge spring, but the canopy of evergreen leaves evokes high summer. Courtesy of a break in the clouds, I’m granted a sudden sun-dappled moment of light and warmth that is both February 2020 and July 1851."
"Over the next week the Guardian’s Animals farmed series will focus on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has been growing at a pretty steady pace over the past 50 years. It’s not an industry that most of us think about very often, though meat consumption has become one of the big discussions of our time.  Most of us struggle to grasp the full complexity of the modern farming system, where an animal may be born in one location, transported to another for most of its life, then sent to a third – if it is a beef cow – for fattening, and at last to a final place for its death. Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries in journeys that can take weeks. Every day, at least 5 million creatures are in transit, as part of the secretive global trade in live farm animals. And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys; they do not include long journeys within a country. This trade is making money and creating jobs for farmers, operators and companies – and its defenders argue that the vast majority of transport is carried out in a humane, thoughtful way, overseen by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). But it also raises a number of key issues – to which we are still seeking satisfactory answers: 1) Why are animals being transported long distances live, rather than slaughtered, and then transported as refrigerated meat? Are economics trumping animal welfare? 2) Is the animal disease notification system really working? Currently, countries monitor their own diseases, and notify OIE when they spot one. A ban may then be placed on the regions where the disease is present, or on the whole country. But at least one expert told us this leads to perverse incentives – and many pointed to the peculiar pattern of China’s notifications on African swine fever as evidence that the disease had been in the country for some time before China submitted a notification. Is there a better way? 3) Why has the EU become such a key player in this global trade? EU countries figure heavily in the top exporters of live animals – and exports from the EU28 as a whole to the rest of the world have trebled to around $3bn a year since 2000 (again, that figure doesn’t include the huge trade in live animals within EU borders). Yet the EU prides itself on having one of the most progressive animal welfare policies in the world. Are the two things compatible? Over the next week we’ll be examining a number of aspects of the global trade. Today we look at how this trade has grown and the implications. We also look at the situation in Ireland, where farmers are at a loss over how to deal with a potential “calf tsunami”. On Tuesday we look at the disease implications, speaking to international vets about the threats posed by the international animal trade. On Wednesday we look at some of the countries that have vigorous live animal industries – and the economic impacts. On Thursday we’ll look at why the trade has risen so steeply in Europe, and examine whether the shipping fleet is fit for purpose. On Friday we’ll look at the countries where the animals are consumed – and see how consumer preferences are playing a role in the global trade. And on Saturday we’ll delve into the welfare implications.

"Scientists exploring the deep sea off Australia’s coast have discovered as many as 30 new marine species – and what may be the longest animal ever seen. The discoveries were the result of expeditions into Western Australia’s underwater canyons. One of the biggest discoveries was a siphonophore measuring an estimated 150 feet (46 metres). Siphonophores are deep-sea predators made up of many small clones that act together as one and spread out like a single long string in the water. Researchers think this particular siphonophore may be the longest yet found. The expedition also collected a number of other deep-sea animals that the researchers suspected had not yet been documented, including an octopus squid, a long-tailed sea cucumber, glass sponges and the first giant hydroids – a colony of animals that looks like an upside-down jellyfish – ever seen in Australia. Nerida Wilson, a senior research scientist at the Western Australia Museum, who led the expedition, said the discovery of the extra-long siphonophore came when many researchers on board were least expecting it. The research vehicle dived as deep as 4,439 metres, but the siphonophore was only discovered as the vehicle was making its way back to the surface at around 630 metres. “Most scientists had drifted out of the control room,” Wilson said. “The word soon spread and people came pouring into the control room to share the excitement. It was just amazing to see this huge organism spread out like a spiral UFO, hovering in the water column. We couldn’t believe what we were seeing.” Siphonophores, like jellyfish, feed by dangling stinging tentacles in the water. Small crustaceans and fish unlucky enough to swim into this curtain of tentacles are paralyzed and reeled up to the body of the colony. The new siphonophore was about twice as long as many blue whales, and three times as long as a humpback whale, which usually grow to around 50ft long. The expedition was led by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, a non-profit group that supports oceanographic research, including the provision of a research vessel and remotely operated vehicle, which the Australian government and scientific institutions otherwise lack. The discovery of the siphonophore and other possibly unknown species was made in a protected area known as the Gascoyne Coast bioregion. This highlights what Wilson described as “one of the disconnects between where we are with ocean conservation and knowledge”. “While it’s a protected area, we actually have no idea what lives there,” she said. “We really wanted to reveal the incredible biodiversity that is there.” Wilson acknowledged it will be months or years before researchers will be sure that the organisms they discovered are new to science. “We were definitely looking for and expecting new species,” she said. “Those waters were just too unexplored to not yield such treasures.”"
