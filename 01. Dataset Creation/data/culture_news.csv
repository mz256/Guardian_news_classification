"Over three centuries, it has been ravaged by fire and the wrecking ball. But now the world’s first factory will rise again from the ashes of its former self, repurposed as a new cathedral for the maker movement. Amid huge interest in creating and refashioning things, Derby’s Museum of Making, which opens this spring, is launching at an auspicious time. “Look at how popular TV programmes like The Repair Shop are,” said Tony Butler, executive director of Derby Museums. “Making resonates with the public.” The maker movement is a subculture that embraces and celebrates the physical act of creating something. Borrowing from traditional hobbies such as woodworking, textile design and metalwork, there is a strong emphasis on repurposing existing objects and finding fun and fulfilment in the act of creation. Couple the huge interest in making with the UK’s desire to understand its new post-Brexit role in the world while grappling with its colonial past and the climate crisis, and it may transpire that the museum is the attraction the country did not know it needed right now. “We are really keen on putting forward the idea that every young person can be a maker,” Butler said. “The challenges that we face in the 21st century, things like climate change and environmental loss, much of that will be mitigated by technology, engineering and ingenuity, and those are the kind of makers we need in the future.” The museum is located in Derby city centre on the site of a silk mill that opened in 1721 and whose claim to being the world’s first factory lies in the fact that it was the first fully mechanised mill supplied by a single power source. With £18m funding from the national lottery, local development agencies and the Arts Council, there are hopes that the museum, located in the Derwent Valley Mills Unesco World Heritage Site, will show how people can be attracted back into city centres in a post-Covid world. Those behind the museum say there has been extensive consultation among the local community, with their feedback helping shaping its design. Volunteers even cleaned 11,000 bricks from the original factory to be repurposed in the new building. “The site has changed since the first factory burned down,” explained Hannah Fox, director of projects and programmes at the museum. “Bits of it have fallen down and there have been major disasters over 300 years of its life, but every single time something happened it was rebuilt by the city because it was so important.” The new building, designed by Bauman Lyon Architects, retains the original factory’s Italianate tower, its arches and Grade I-listed gates but, in Fox’s words it will be “a kind of mash-up of lots of different periods”. “We are redefining it for what it needs to be at this time, and that is a place that really tells a story and inspires people to see themselves as makers,” Fox said. Butler explained that an “entire culture” had emerged out of the worldwide maker movement. “It’s not just lads with beards in their sheds in Shoreditch tinkering with old bikes. That whole culture of making resonates with someone, whether they’re in San Francisco or London or Derby.” He said the new museum would explore the links between the factory in its first incarnation and the Derby of today, home to the likes of Rolls-Royce and Toyota. But it would also confront the relationship between the industrial revolution and today’s problems, such as the devastating legacy of fossil fuels and the textile industry’s reliance on slavery. “The general, pervasive view of the industrial revolution in Britain is very much that of the ‘great man’ narrative,” Butler said. “There’s this idea that the industrial revolution was down to unique British exceptionalism. We want to acknowledge that innovation can be driven by individual revelation and genius, but the revolution also did rely, in the factory system’s case, on a ready supply of workers and raw resources.” Almost all of the museum’s 30,000 artefacts will be on display. “Most museums have the majority of their collections in store but this museum will have pretty much everything accessible to the public,” Fox said. “They range from a huge engine donated by Rolls-Royce to a fantastic little engine run by a single human hair that was showcased at the Chicago World’s Fair in the 1930s.” The museum will also return to the manufacturing roots of the original factory by making things – including exhibition displays that will be built on site and sold to other museums. “It will be a full workshop space for new businesses to prototype and manufacture things they want to take to market,” Fox said. “It’s a place of making in every sense.” A previous museum on the site closed in the mid 2000s. “Visitor numbers were dwindling,” Butler explained. “It was to do with the way in which the narrative was framed as something that was inherently in the past. It meant fewer and fewer people were coming to visit the museum. It was seen as almost a paean or a longing for a lost industrial age. What we are trying to do with this museum is make it contemporary and relevant to the sorts of work in which people are engaged today.”"
"Of course, everyone had a cameo in Ricky Gervais’s TV industry comedy. But even in this crowded field, Bowie stole the show. After all, funny as Ross Kemp was, he wasn’t going to be able to perform a deliciously cruel song (“He’s banal and facile, he’s a fat waste of space”) mocking the sitcom’s hero. In a show about empty fame, Bowie was a reminder of what talent actually means. God moves in mysterious ways. And like most religious figureheads, his son can manifest him or herself in any form. If, like Johnny Vegas’s Moz, you were a grubby stoner seeking guidance, why wouldn’t Jesus take the appearance of the Fall frontman? Bathed in a heavenly glow, Smith swears lustily as he dispenses enigmatic advice. Amusingly, Leslie Knope begins the scene containing Biden’s cameo by pondering the possibility that she might run for the presidency in 2020. She then meets the man we now know as the president-elect – and their encounter suggests that, for all Leslie’s charm, when it came to taking down Donald Trump, America made the right choice. Kingsley is very much in Hollywood luvvie mode here, not Don “Sexy Beast” Logan mode. He’s approached to star in Christopher Moltisanti’s film Cleaver but is unimpressed by the idea. His dismissive tone leads to Christopher reverting to gangster type – as Kingsley’s fellow guest star Lauren Bacall discovers to her cost. Created specifically for Minogue by Russell T Davies, waitress Astrid Peth was a very temporary companion for David Tennant’s Doctor in the 2007 Christmas special. Although we barely got to know Astrid, she still managed to save the world. Even then, reviews were mixed. Tough crowd. Part of Swift’s appeal is her quality of being simultaneously striking and deeply normal. So her brief cameo in New Girl – where she suddenly upends Cece and Shivrang’s wedding by declaring her feelings for Shivrang – worked perfectly. Her appearance provided both a startled jolt and a knowing smile. The “blink and you’ll miss it” quality of this cameo adds to its appeal. In the last ever episode of Father Ted, “Father Brian Eno”, as he’s introduced, is on screen for a couple of seconds. In pre-streaming days, when watching something again meant waiting for a repeat, you might even wonder if it happened at all. Much as The Bill was an essential stamp in any young British actor’s passport, so it was in the US with Law & Order. The show always liked a cameo, too – but even viewers used to surprising guest appearances did a double take when tennis star Serena Williams turned up, playing a basketball player and revenge porn victim. The premise for this cameo was that Will (Pitt) was an old school friend whose dislike of Rachel had led to him start a rumour that she was intersex. It is offensive and surprising in equal measure, but back in 2001 the main source of intrigue was the fact that Jennifer Aniston was starring opposite her real-life husband. “You look like me. Magnum, as well.” The nightclub encounter between Bernard Hill’s tragic hero Yosser Hughes and Liverpool FC’s moustachioed hard man Graeme Souness is both funny and deeply sad. Hughes is a desperate man, robbed of agency and identity by forces beyond his control; Souness is both a point of aspiration and a focus for his anger."
"Ballet dancer Francesca Hayward was born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992 and moved to West Sussex at the age of two. She began training at the Royal Ballet School aged 11, and on graduating joined the company. Within a year, she was cast as Clara in The Nutcracker and in 2016 became a principal dancer. She played the role of Victoria in Tom Hooper’s film of the musical Cats and last year starred in the film Romeo and Juliet: Beyond Words. The Royal Ballet and Opera is streaming productions via its website. Full details at roh.org.uk. Apartamento I am about to move flats and it has got me really into interiors. I’m a massive magazine hoarder, which I got from my grandmother. I love this magazine because it’s a little less done than the usual interiors magazines. It’s off the beaten track, a bit quirky and original. People pick up things from flea markets and it’s not about having really expensive stuff - it’s about the way you put stuff together. I feel that people don’t really tidy their rooms before the photographers come in, which I like. More real! Pina (Directed by Wim Wenders) This whole year, being at home and not being able to dance and not having the freedom or the space to move the way I like to, I have found myself going back to one of my favourite dance films, about German choreographer Pina Bausch. She died some years ago, but I love her work. It is very modern and very ahead of its time. There’s this particular walk the dancers all do in a procession. There are four hand gestures they do with facial expressions and it brings me so much joy. When I was getting a bit frustrated at home, I would just be in my tiny flat doing the Pina Bausch walk by myself. Night Sky With Exit Wounds by Ocean Vuong I just read Night Sky With Exit Wounds and considering I’m not a poetry fanatic, I found it really beautiful. Sometimes, I find poetry a bit too vague; I don’t really understand it and I don’t pretend to. I love dance, as sometimes there is so much stuff you can’t particularly express, but you get it when you watch it though you might not be able to explain it. And this book is the kind of poetry you can understand. It is pretty special. Succession (Sky Atlantic/NowTV) It’s about a billionaire family living in New York. They’re all fighting to lead the family company. There is a lot of betrayal and twists and turns, but it is kind of comical. They’re a crazy bunch of characters but what I loved about it was that each actor in it was really committed to their role. They were so believable as their own individual person. The one who made me laugh the most was probably Roman, played by Kieran Culkin. Pastificio Gentile pasta I hate cooking with a passion. I hate everything to do with it. I’m not a natural chef. It stresses me out! But I do a lot of pasta. This spaghetti brand — I discovered it by accident. I just picked it up in the supermarket and it changed my life. It sounds really dramatic but I just love it. My most simple meal is caramelised onions and parmesan and my most indulgent is tomato, mascarpone and burrata. The spaghetti just tastes the best with everything and is so satisfying when you twirl it around the fork. Secret People (Thorold Dickinson, 1952) I haven’t watched this yet but it is on my list because there was a documentary about Audrey Hepburn that recently came out [Audrey] that I was involved in and I learned so much about her. I never knew that her first dream was to be a ballerina before an actress. She actually does a lot of ballet in Secret People. I’ve seen clips and she looks very beautiful as a dancer, so I’m intrigued to see her doing her thing. We all just know her as a beautiful woman and presence on the screen but it is very different to know that she fell into that and her real passion was for ballet."
"Dust and rain storm at Parkes, NSW, AustraliaJason Davies/Severe Weather Australia 19 January Dust storms are a pretty common occurrence in Central New South Wales but a colleague said to me: “You might want to come and look at this one.” He was right. It looked far more apocalyptic than usual – so I quickly got my drone up to take some shots. This image captures the gravity of the storm and makes it look really dramatic; I was in the right place at the right time. It went viral in Australia but I still love showing it to people for the first time. You see their jaws drop because it looks so surreal – a lot of people think it’s a scene from a movie! AM Locust swarms plague KenyaDai Kurokawa/EPA 24 January These huge swarms of desert locusts caused devastation across East Africa and the Middle East. We had a Kenyan reporter from Kitui County as part of our team who was able to locate affected farmers, including the young man in this picture. As you can see, the locusts were pink, which wasn’t what I expected. The ones that came from Yemen and Somalia were yellow, but then they died and were replaced by a new generation – young locusts are pink during their first week of life. You can take pictures of locusts in the sky, but I wanted to capture the magnitude of the swarm, which meant getting people in the shot. The farmers were desperately trying to chase away the insects – they tried many techniques, including banging pots and pans to create as much noise as possible. This farmer was chasing the locusts around with a machete. There were hundreds of them landing on his face and flying under his shirt. He was trying really hard to chase them away, but it didn’t really work and, sadly, his crops were badly damaged. AM Elephants eating on a rubbish dump in Oluvil, Sri LankaTharmaplan Tilaxan/Cover Images 22 February One evening, I saw a herd of wild elephants foraging for food in a garbage mound close to the forest bordering the Oluvil-Palakkad area of Sri Lanka. I was aggravated by the sight of the elephants living this way and I wanted to draw attention to their plight by capturing these images. The conditions I was shooting in were tough. Breathing was difficult because of the stench, and I began to develop a skin condition due to spending so much time in the garbage dump. While awareness of elephants eating plastic that has been dumped near their habitat is growing, many Sri Lankans remain unaware, or simply think it’s the government’s responsibility. My hope is that as awareness spreads, a positive change is bound to follow. AM Harry and Meghan arrive at the Endeavour Fund awardsJustin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images 5 March By the time this photo was taken, the rumour that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were departing for Hollywood had been around for a while, so I was hoping to get a picture with a bit of Hollywood glamour. There’s always a bit of luck involved with shooting royals or celebrities because there’s only so much control you have over the environment. For instance, a member of their security team could step in and block the shot and then there’s nothing you can do to move them. People have commented on how magical this photo looks and I think that’s down to the way the rain interacts with the flash to create a dramatic silhouette of the couple. They did indeed leave the UK shortly after, so it was really satisfying to get this shot before they went. AM Goats run wild in deserted Llandudno, WalesChris Furlong/Getty Images 31 March The story broke on Twitter that goats were taking over Llandudno town centre and I went there to try to get some fun pictures. It was like a weird good-news story: animals reinheriting the Earth in the chaos of that early lockdown period. At the time, I was mainly just documenting the emptiness, taking photos of empty streets, empty beaches, empty parks. Getting to photograph those ebullient goats definitely made for a few smiles and a nice break from the monotony of those bleak days. It was really just a case of keeping my distance and letting the goats do their thing. AM  Yasmine Protho graduates in Cusseta, GeorgiaBrynn Anderson/AP 15 May Yasmine and her family all walked in with the image of her on their masks – they’d had them made specially, it was really sweet. Because of Covid restrictions, only 10 students and their families were allowed to be present. The school set up a stage on the football field and all the graduating students had to keep 6ft apart. The stands were completely empty so it was very quiet. When I spoke to Yasmine she said she was excited to graduate, but she also seemed kind of sombre. She looked very beautiful; she’d had her lashes done and I think she wanted people to see who she was with the image on her mask. This was early in the pandemic and there wasn’t as much information as we have now, so I didn’t know what to expect, but it was a very interesting and eerie graduation. LH BLM protester in Atlanta, GeorgiaLynsey Weatherspoon 29 May Being there to document the BLM protests was extremely important to me as a black woman in America. I’ve always gravitated to images that reflect my own identity, and the fact that this image conveys the power of black women in our society is a great source of pride. That was my first time taking photos of a protest and I didn’t know what to expect, but it was really powerful to witness and document. Complete strangers were looking out for each other and I think the emotional significance of that was heightened by the pandemic. When I took the photo I thought it was a cool shot, but it was only when I posted it to Instagram that I realised how powerful the image could be. Da’nai [the woman in the photo] looks like a spiritual figure; I feel like you learn so many things about her, the BLM movement and America when you look at this picture. AM Protests over the killing of George Floyd in MinneapolisPhilip Montgomery 30 May When George Floyd died, it struck me that this community mourning the loss of one of their own was an important moment and I needed to get up to Minneapolis. This photograph was taken in front of the fifth police precinct. The night before, demonstrators had set fire to a number of structures across the street from the police station. The presence of law enforcement was non-existent and, in a lot of ways the police had lost control of the city. However, they would occasionally charge out of the station in full force, in an attempt to clear the area of demonstrators. I remember taking pictures outside the station when there was this wall of teargas and these Hollywood stormtroopers emerged from the smoke. I had covered similar situations in Ferguson and Baltimore, but the police in Minneapolis were taking a real gloves-off approach. For me this photo really speaks to how militarised the police force has become. AM Patrick Hutchinson rescues BLM counter-protesterDylan Martinez/Reuters 14 June This picture was taken at the third or fourth major UK BLM demo in the space of a month. The counter-protesters had advertised that they were going to be around Westminster protecting statues and in the back of my mind I was looking for an opportunity to juxtapose the two sides in one frame. I saw one of the counter–protesters – since identified as Bryn Male – go to the ground and I immediately thought he was in serious danger. Through the fray, I saw another man, Patrick Hutchinson, a BLM protester, dive in and whip him up on to his back before running towards me. It wasn’t just Male – I saw Patrick and his team protecting another three or four people moments later.  Most pictures that resonate with people are heart-wrenching: there’s something about them that draws you in, but they’re never particularly easy to look at. To get two stories together in a positive image like this is quite rare. The stars aligned for me that day. AM Marcus Rashford support in WythenshaweMolly Darlington/Reuters 16 June I saw this sign on social media one evening and I immediately went out to get the shot. I live about 20 minutes away but I knew I couldn’t wait around, because if someone took it down then it would be gone for ever. Once it was taken down, the National Football Museum in Manchester put out a call online for the sign and someone posted it to them anonymously. Marcus Rashford’s campaign was obviously a big story and this picture represents the community of Manchester’s support for him. AM A couple draws guns on protesters in St Louis, MissouriLawrence Bryant/Reuters 29 June People were protesting against the city mayor Lyda Krewson – they wanted her to resign [for revealing the names and addresses of people who called for police reform]. They were marching towards her house when I saw these two people – one on the porch and one on the lawn – pointing guns at the protesters and shouting: “Get out!” I was nervous; I didn’t know their intentions – the woman was angrily shaking the gun and her finger was on the trigger. It felt surreal, to have a person that is angered by you pointing a gun at you, and you don’t even know why. It was mind-boggling.  Plenty of photos just showed the couple, but I really wanted to show who they were pointing the guns at. You can go all the way back in history and you can always see a white person pointing a gun at black people. It’s like nothing has changed. LH Young football fan celebrates Liverpool’s Premier League victoryOli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images 22 July The Champions League celebrations in 2019 were bonkers – 750,000 people lined the streets – but we knew the [Premier League] title celebrations would be different because of Covid. Even though it was during the summer, when many of the lockdown restrictions had been lifted, we had no idea how many people would turn up – but there were thousands of jubilant supporters outside the stadium. I’ve covered Glastonbury a few times and it was a similar atmosphere. What I love about this picture is the raw human emotion. It’s just this little kid celebrating one of the goals [Liverpool beat Chelsea 5-3] and he’s totally oblivious to me and the camera. When someone’s lost in the moment like that, it’s hard to go too far wrong. AM A naked sunbather chases  a wild boar,  Teufelssee lake, BerlinAdele Landauer/AFP/Getty Images 5 August I was swimming at the Teufelssee lake when I saw a boar with her babies eating a discarded pizza. Boars are common here, but my granddaughter lives in LA and I thought she had probably never seen one, so I took out my phone to photograph them. I had the camera ready when I saw the boar grab a yellow bag in her mouth, and then a naked man chasing her – you are allowed to be nude in this area. He was yelling: “Argh, in this bag is my computer!” and clapping his hands in the hope the boar would let it go. I’m a life coach and I thought it was a good example of someone staying focused and doing whatever it takes to achieve their goal. Everyone around was cheering him on, and he was successful in getting the bag back. With his permission I posted the picture online – I expected to get my usual 30 likes, but my daughter called an hour later and said it had gone viral! LH Wildfire and Covid in CaliforniaNoah Berger/AP 19 August I’ve been photographing fires since 2013, but this year has been mind-blowing in terms of the scope of land enveloped in flames and the scale of the devastation. Over one million acres [400,000 hectares] were badly damaged and thousands of people were forced to leave their homes. I spent four or five days out in the field, sleeping in my car, which allowed me to stay immersed in the world I was trying to capture. At this particular fire in Napa County, I spent about an hour and a half with an 84-year-old man and his son who were defending their home. I was looking to photograph something that would signal the location, but this sign gave me an opportunity to combine two major events into one image. In this photo, I see the downward spiral of 2020: you’re worried about this horrible thing and something even worse comes along. AM Lone protester at anti-government demonstrations, BangkokJorge Silva/Reuters 16 October There had been pro-democracy protests in Bangkok all year but I knew this one would be different because they were taking place after the government banned mass gatherings. This meant the police were allowed to employ force to break up groups, which spurred thousands of people into action. I had run back to a higher position to get shots of the police assembled in formation when I saw this man pushing against the barrier on his own. I must have got four or five shots, but within seconds the demonstration was a complete mess, with the police firing water cannons and bodies flying everywhere. The protesters rely heavily on Twitter and this picture was all over Thai social media within a day. AM Dominic Cummings leaves Downing StreetHollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images 13 November I got a call from my editor in the morning saying Cummings’ departure was imminent but spent most of the day waiting around with nothing to shoot. Around 4pm, I started to get anxious because the light was fading but I was determined to get the shot. A little later he just walked out, holding a box. I had pictured it as a wide shot of him by the door, but it came out underexposed, so I decided to follow him down the street. He didn’t seem fazed by the camera, or to even acknowledge it, which in my experience is bizarre. I remember being annoyed that he didn’t turn to face me but I think his silhouette, with the Houses of Parliament in the background, works pretty well. AM Gang members in a cell at Quezaltepeque jail, El SalvadorJosé Cabezas/Reuters 23 November It’s not easy to photograph inside a jail in El Salvador, particularly those full of MS-13 gang members. A month before this photo was taken, [Latin American news site] El Faro alleged that the government had offered gang members benefits like fast food and favourable treatment in exchange for a reduction of violence on the streets. With elections due to take place next year, the government then invited the media in to prove how harsh their treatment of prisoners really was. I had been to the jail in 2012 and was astonished at how bad it smelled and the gang-related graffiti everywhere. This time the jail was still crowded, but it was much cleaner. Every government wants to look tough but, internationally, the reaction to this image was very negative, which I can understand. It seems inhumane to cram thousands of prisoners in like that during a pandemic. AM A  hug through a  Covid safety curtain in São PauloNelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images 13 June I’ve been a photojournalist in São Paulo for 32 years, so I’ve covered big health scares such as Aids and Zika before, but this pandemic is on a different level. I heard about a care home that was using a “cuddle curtain” to allow families to touch their loved ones – many of them had gone months without visitors, and they had begun to complain about how lonely they were. This picture shows Luiza Yassuko, 76, being embraced by her sister-in-law, who visited with her husband, Silvio. It’s been an intense year. I’ve followed the suffering of many people who have been negatively affected by coronavirus, but I’ve also seen people act charitably and with resilience, which has affirmed my faith in the human spirit. AM People pay tribute to Maradona in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaPaula Acunzo/Zuma Press/eyevine 25 November I received a WhatsApp message from a friend saying Maradona was dead. I was in shock and, because of Covid, I didn’t know if it would be possible for people to gather to say goodbye. I decided to go to the Argentinos Juniors club, the first place he played football – the drawing on the wall there is very popular and I knew it would give the picture context. People started to come and cry, giving kisses to the wall – it was so emotional because he represented so much for us. He was a controversial man, but people didn’t see that on this day. They were just sharing their memories and showing pictures they’d taken with Maradona. I’m not a football fan but it was still really sad for me; he’s like a hero. LH  Margaret Keenan becomes the first person in the UK to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine Jacob King/Pool via Reuters 8 December I got to the University Hospital in Coventry at 5.15am and Margaret was vaccinated at around 6.30am. It would have been quite nerve-racking for her, but the nurse put her at ease straight away. I knew this was an important moment, and there was a lot of excitement on the clinical side of things. I took a few pictures of Margaret actually getting the jab, which I quickly filed before taking this image of her being wheeled back to the ward. The nurses were there to applaud her return – it was a really positive atmosphere and you could feel the relief. Even though there’s no glossing over the fact that a lot of people are still dying every day, it was good to see a positive news image, and hopefully the beginning of the return to normality. LH"
"A simple wrought-iron footbridge built by a 19th-century rights of way activist has joined some of the England’s grandest buildings and monuments on the national heritage list. The bridge in Essex was one of 423 additions to the list in 2020, along with an 18th-century smugglers’ shipwreck in Kent; an Italianate villa-style railway station in Nottinghamshire; a water tower in West Yorkshire that can be seen for miles around; and Selfridges department store in London. Historic England on Wednesday published a list of what it called the “most captivating” sites listed this year. Duncan Wilson, chief executive of the government body, said that despite the challenges faced by the heritage sector in 2020 there had been “many brilliant additions” to the list. “From a picturesque footbridge in Essex to an excellently preserved railway station cafe in the Midlands, we want to ensure England’s rich and varied cultural heritage is protected so that the public can continue to cherish the heritage that makes their local places so important.” The footbridge is called Nunn’s bridge and spans the Blackwater River near Coggeshall. It was erected in 1892 by a blacksmith and social campaigner, Henry “Dick” Nunn, who had spent years calling for the replacement of the previous wooden footbridge, which had fallen into decay and washed away. Historic England said the bridge was unique in its design, craftmanship and installation, funded and constructed by Nunn himself. Nunn was well known locally: popular, eccentric and argumentative, he campaigned for the welfare of people and animals as well as being an early advocate of rights of way in the countryside. His activism predates the establishment of the National Trust in 1895 and the Ramblers Association in 1935. The bridge, originally pink, has been given Grade II listing, one of 371 new listing entries to the register. A total of 27 new places have been protected as scheduled monuments including the Old Brig shipwreck at Seasalter in Kent, which was exposed by tides after lying in the mud of the Thames for hundreds of years. Archaeologists think it was probably used by smugglers who operated in the area: the Seasalter coast is known as a place where contraband such as liquor was brought ashore. The remains of the hull, including framing timbers and decking, have been explored and there is potential, Historic England said, “for more exciting finds to be found preserved … which could reveal how the sailors lived on board and what goods the ship was carrying”. Selfridges on Oxford Street, London, has been upgraded from Grade II to Grade II*. The department store was, Historic England said, “key to transforming the British high street at the turn of the 20th century”. The railway station highlighted by Historic England is at Retford in Nottinghamshire. Built between 1891 and 1892 by the Great Northern Railway, it replaced a smaller station unable to cope with the growing volume of passengers. A particularly striking feature is the recently discovered ornate tiling in its dining and refreshment rooms; most other such examples have not survived. It has been listed at Grade II, as has Gawthorpe water tower in West Yorkshire, which was constructed between 1922 and 1928 and used to store drinking water for the village. Known by locals as the “iron giant” it is, say experts, far more interesting than a typical water tower, with panelling that makes it aesthetically pleasing as well as functional."
"The electoral college certified Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election on Monday, which means that “for the 30th time, Donald Trump’s attempts to undo the election have once again finally come to and end”, said Trevor Noah on Tuesday’s Daily Show. With that vote, a constitutional formality reflecting state election results known weeks ago, “even some of [Trump’s] biggest enablers are accepting reality”. On Tuesday, the Republican senators Pat Toomey, John Thune and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, all publicly acknowledged Biden as president-elect. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, also congratulated Biden with a message that reportedly read: “I am ready for interaction and contacts with you.” “Putin doesn’t sound human, he sounds like a self-checkout at a CVS – ‘Ready for interaction. Pleased to place item in the bag,’” Noah joked. “What a weird phrase – ‘I am ready for interaction and contacts with you?’ Sounds like Mike Pence getting frisky. “And you know Trump’s luck has run out now that Mitch McConnell has conceded the election,” Noah continued. “Because forget Putin – if Mitch can’t find a way to subvert American democracy, then it just can’t be done.” In other news, attorney general and longtime Trump stalwart William Barr announced Monday he would step down from the lame-duck administration just five weeks before the Biden transition. The decision “surprised some people”, said Noah, “because for a long time, it seemed like he was ride or die with Trump. He whitewashed the Mueller reports, he protected Trump’s cronies, he even reportedly ordered peaceful protesters to be teargassed just so that Trump could walk over to a church and wave a Bible next to it.” The point is, “these two were like Batman and Robin, if Batman and Robin couldn’t fit into their tights”, Noah joked. Which means only one of two things happened: “Either Barr quit, because Trump is too batshit crazy even for him, or Trump fired Barr because he’s not batshit crazy enough to roll in this White House.” Seeing that the whole Trump White House will be out of a job come 20 January, Noah concluded, “at least Bill Barr is beating the traffic”. With the electoral college certification of Joe Biden’s victory, “some Republicans have been forced to face their biggest fear: reality”, said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. On Tuesday, McConnell “took to the Senate floor and bravely faced a fact”, which is, in his words, that “the electoral college has spoken. So today I want to congratulate President-Elect Joe Biden.” Similarly, the Texas senator John Cornyn told reporters: “There comes a time when you have to realize that despite your best efforts, you’ve been unsuccessful.” “It’s like we tell kids when they play sports,” Colbert mocked. “It is important to realize when you’ve lost, and then six weeks later drive back to the field so you can shake the other team’s hands and say, ‘Good game, you cheater.’” Still, even with the concessions of leading Senate Republicans, “some in the GOP are still struggling to mince words in a way that will appease he who shall not be named”, Colbert explained, such as the Wyoming senator John Barrasso, who called a straightforward question on whether or not Biden was president-elect a “gotcha” question. “Yeah, classic gotcha question,” Colbert deadpanned, “like ‘Who’s the president?’ and ‘What’s your name?’ and ‘What year is it?’ and ‘How many fingers am I holding up?’” Even Putin has acknowledged Trump’s defeat, Colbert continued, and it’s “not a great look for Senate Republicans when the guy who interfered in our election is like, ‘Come on, he won, at a certain point you guys are poisoning democracy.’” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel panned “turtle-faced” McConnell’s belated congratulations to Biden. The Senate majority leader announced Tuesday that “as of this morning, our country has a president-elect” – “as if we hadn’t had one for the 40 more mornings before that”, Kimmel said. Biden’s congratulatory message from “Trump’s KGBFF” Putin that the Russian leader is “ready for cooperation and contacts with you” should be “easy”, Kimmel continued, “because Russia just hacked all of our contacts”. “But wait, if Putin is offering a congratulatory handshake to Joe Biden, then what is Trump eating pellets out of?” he added. Meanwhile, Trump continued to deny the electoral reality, tweeting on Tuesday more baseless claims of election fraud eventually flagged by Twitter as misleading or untrue. “I can’t believe they’re still bothering to put up that little warning under every one of his bogus tweets,” Kimmel said of Twitter’s post-hoc factchecking. “Why not just post a banner at the top of the whole feed that says, ‘This space is condemned?’”"
"By any standards it was an epic lunch: the finest soup, jellied trout and rice with prawns, quail stuffed with truffles and foie gras, chicken, beef, duck, asparagus, wonderful Viennese doughnuts, sweet soufflés decorated with gold leaf, and not forgetting tiny songbirds, which are either a luxurious delight, or a gastronomic disgrace. The birds, called ortolans, weigh about an ounce and were hunted and kept in darkness for weeks to fatten up. They were then drowned in Armagnac, roasted and served sizzling to be eaten in a single hedonistic mouthful. The late chef Anthony Bourdain once described eating an ortolan as a “sort of a hot rush of fat, guts, bones, blood and meat … really delicious”. Today ortolan hunting is banned and eating them frowned upon, but in 1890 they were very much on the menu for what ranks as one of Queen Victoria’s favourite meals. The story of the meal is to be told in a new display exploring the history and secrets of the kitchen at one of Britain’s grandest country houses, Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire. Pippa Shirley, head of collections and gardens at Waddesdon, said kitchens were the “unsung heroes” of the UK’s mansions and country estates. “There is just so much more interest now from the public in how these big houses worked, how they ran, so it is nice to be able to discover more,” she said. “Downton [Abbey] has played a huge role, but I also think that people are more interested in their history, if you think of people using Ancestry, or programmes like Who Do You Think You Are?.” Waddesdon’s kitchen was particularly impressive. The house was completed in 1883 as a weekend retreat for one of Britain’s richest men, Lord Ferdinand de Rothschild. It was at Waddesdon, now run by the National Trust, that Rothschild would host his lavish Saturday-to-Monday house parties with the finest food and drink as well, of course, as the Sèvres porcelain to eat off and Gainsboroughs to admire on the walls. In 1890, Victoria came for lunch, arriving at Aylesbury by train from Windsor. The menu for the royal visit is the only one that survived from the time. As was the royal custom, the Queen ate separately from other guests. She was in the main dining room with her daughters while everyone else was in a smaller dining room. The Royal Artillery Band played jolly tunes between the two rooms. Victoria evidently enjoyed herself, with Rothschild later noting: “The royal appetite is proverbial, and it was not until about half past three that the Queen … reappeared.” His butler reported that her majesty had returned to the cold beef for a second helping. The meal made quite an impression on the Queen, Shirley said. “We know that she sent people from Windsor to learn secrets from the Waddesdon kitchen. The standard of cuisine was very, very high.” The menu will go on display along with photographs that curators hope will help fill in gaps in knowledge about the people who worked in the kitchen. “We have rather less information than you might imagine about the staff here, and it would be nice to know more about the servants and their lives,” Shirley said. A grainy black and white photograph, taken around 1900, shows how accurately the Waddesdon kitchen was restored in the 1990s, but curators would love to know who the people gathered round the table are. Rothschild died in 1898 and the running of the house was passed to his sister Alice. Catherine Taylor, Waddesdon’s head archivist, said she was fairly certain Alice’s chef at the time was a Monsieur Bonnar, of whom very little is known apart from he died in a car accident in Brighton in 1915. According to the scant records which do exist, other kitchen staff members were called Annie Gough, Susan Smith, Susan Cole and Fanny Sams. Taylor said: “If you have been researching your family history or know of ancestors who worked at the manor at this time, we’d be delighted if you got in touch. Especially if you have any old family photos that may help us to identify the individual members of our turn-of-the century kitchen brigade.”"
"Born in 1965, Gretchen Rubin is a bestselling author and speaker who grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. Best known for writing on the themes of happiness and wellbeing, she published The Happiness Project in 2009 and, most recently, Outer Order, Inner Calm in 2019. Her podcast, Happier With Gretchen, which she co-hosts with her sister Elizabeth Craft, has won several awards, including a Webby earlier this year. She lives in New York with her husband and two daughters.  Mule Skinner Blues by Dolly Parton I came across it randomly, this old, almost yodelling song covered by Dolly Parton in 1970. It’s a country classic and has this refrain of “hey hey” – If you need a lift, it will make you happy. I love Dolly Parton. I feel like she’s one of the few universals. All of the books that she’s donated over the years for her Imagination Library… She’s done so much for the people of her state and country – and now the world with her donations to vaccine research. She’s a secular saint, in a way. Twenty Thousand Hertz One of the ways I work off my restless energy from all the Zoom meetings and not travelling is by going for long walks in Central Park while listening to a terrific podcast. I’m loving this one. Beautifully produced, it’s all about the power of hearing, exploring noise pollution, special effects in movies and so on… It really awakened my sense of hearing and my appreciation of the auditory world, and made me much more aware. Wild Seed by Octavia E Butler Nothing makes me happier than coming across an exciting new author. I love science fiction, and I discovered Octavia E Butler this year. Wild Seed is the first [chronologically] in her Patternist series. It’s sci-fi fantasy and makes you think about human nature and history. The four books cover freedom, control, science, history – all the big themes. Some are about enslavement, others mind-control, and alien species controlling another species. Each can stand alone, but I read them all, and in the preferred order. Russian Doll (Netflix) This is a comedy-drama about the meaning of life and relationships. The main character is a game developer who keeps dying and reliving her 36th birthday and slowly begins to understand her own life. It sounds like the story would quickly run out of steam, but they’ve figured out a way to explode it open that’s really surprising. Natasha Lyonne stars, and created it with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland, an eminent creative team. It’s just very thought-provoking and incredibly binge-able – I loved it so much I watched it twice! Metropolitan Museum of Art At the start of 2020, I decided I was going to visit the Met every single day. And I did that until it shut down in March because of Covid, but now it’s open again – only five days a week and with cut-back hours but it feels like such a treat after not being able to go for so long. They’re very careful about making sure people don’t crowd. It’s their 150th anniversary and this was supposed to be a huge year of celebration, with the show Making the Met 1870-2020, full of all the greatest hits. Hunger by Roxane Gay This is American writer Roxane Gay’s memoir about her relationship with her weight and it’s so searching it really makes you think about your own identity, expression and relationships. Gay’s struggle with her weight has been an important element in her life and identity. The book looks at that and also tries to understand her childhood. Gay has such a powerful voice. I have read a couple of things by her, and I follow her on Twitter, where she’s hilarious, but I feel like this one went the deepest. It’s a super compelling read."
"Chantal Joffe is an American-born British painter. She completed an MA at the Royal College of Art in 1994 and her work has been shown at the National Portrait Gallery and Saatchi Gallery in London, and the Jewish Museum in New York. Joffe’s large-scale paintings mainly depict women and children, and includes many self-portraits. In 2018, she painted herself each day as she went through a divorce and, in 2019, she created the series Pictures of What I Did Not See, which captured a traumatic illness. Her latest show, Story, focuses on ageing and motherhood and will open at Victoria Miro Gallery, London N1, when restrictions are lifted. Tate Britain winter commission Remembering a Brave New World by Chila Kumari Singh Burman cheered me up when I saw it on a grey December morning. It’s great to see the dour facade of Tate Britain covered in bright lights, eyes, an elephant and an ice-cream truck – eclectic, electric gaiety shining out. It’s beautiful and original, and so much more exciting than a stodgy Christmas tree. Go and see it if you live in London – it’s truly a festival of light and can still be enjoyed in our new lockdown reality. Towpath Cafe, London This restaurant on the canal near the Kingsland Road bridge in east London managed to be open for a bit this autumn. It’s in a lockup that opens on to the canal, with green metal tables in the open air. It’s my favourite restaurant. The food changes but in the morning you can always have porridge with walnuts or fried eggs on toast. It’s run by Lori and the chef is Laura and it’s the most beautiful place to eat food like you wish you could make at home yourself, only much better. Great Women Artists Art historian Katy Hessel’s Great Women Artists podcast about the sculptor Alina Szapocznikow was great. She had a conversation with art historian Griselda Pollock, who spoke with such a passion, I had to see the work. Szapocznikow makes strange body casts, sections of torsos, and when Pollock made me aware of her history as a Holocaust survivor, the trauma in the work made so much sense. The work is somewhere between Eva Hesse and Louise Bourgeois. We Are Who We Are (BBC Three) We Are Who We Are took me a while to get into: the pace is slow and I had to concentrate quite hard to understand what was happening. It’s set on an American army base in northern Italy and is mainly about the teenagers that live there and how they interact with the Italian teenagers. In a funny way it does for a new generation what A Room With a View did for mine: it romanticises what it is to be a young visitor in Italy. Even though it’s a much more modern view, there’s something about Italy itself that steals the show for me: glimpses of Venice, the small coffee bars, even the buses – maybe an attitude to love and relationships. Anyway, I’m completely gripped. Everybody by Olivia Laing The new book, Everybody, by my friend Olivia Laing is out this April. It’s a ride through the history of protest and change in the 20th century with Wilhelm Reich as the guide. I love how Laing presents the movements, and the writers, artists and thinkers who were involved in them, and brings them to life without ever judging them. Andrea Dworkin, Sontag, Malcolm X, Freud – they speak to us and come alive again, but we aren’t asked to decide if they are good or bad; we can listen to their thoughts and ideas. It’s a revelation in an age when we seem endlessly to judge and condemn our artists and thinkers. Artemisia Gentileschi, National Gallery, London  For my final choice I am torn between two exhibitions that I loved – Artemisia Gentileschi and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye at Tate Britain, both of which felt radical and exciting. The Artemisia reduced me almost to tears. The sense of her courage, those extraordinary Judith of Holofernes paintings where she seems almost to be cutting off his head while giving birth to him. Art school memories of always being taught an all-male canon came back to me. The self-portraits where she literally paints herself into art history made me want to cry and shout and scream. Yiadom-Boakye’s show was exhilarating. Large, paintings gleaming on the walls, full of energy and mystery – they made me excited to see them."
"Dance schools are expecting to see an increase in men of a certain age signing up for lessons after the soul-stirring Strictly success of Bill Bailey. The comedian, 55, was named winner of the show on Saturday, triumphing over contestants who were less than half his age. On Monday, Bailey said he hoped his example would inspire men. “I think a lot of blokes of my vintage do feel self-conscious on the dancefloor,” he said in an interview on ITV’s Lorraine presented by his fellow contestant Ranvir Singh. “We are always aware of that term ‘dad dancers’ and that makes people feel a bit nervous and, ‘Oh, I don’t want to be that guy shuffling around at the end of the night’. My hope is that me having this success will mean more men of my age might consider taking up a dance class, or maybe just getting fitter, or whatever.” Dance schools said they had already seen an effect and expect that to accelerate when they are allowed to reopen properly. Damiano Soldati, of the Dance Lab in south London, said he had noticed more people of Bailey’s age signing up for beginners’ lessons “and they all talk about Strictly”. His partner, Laura Fox, said it had been great to see Bailey not only win, but deserving to win. “In a dance competition, we have age categories so you would never get an 18-year-old dancing against a 55-year-old. His quickstep … there is nobody in our classes that does it as well as he does. He really does have a talent and what’s good about Bill is that he shows you don’t have to be a specific type of person to do ballroom and Latin. You can like heavy metal but still like to waltz.” Wiecke Eringa, the CEO and artistic director of Yorkshire Dance, said: “It is just fantastic, isn’t it, that someone who doesn’t look a dancer can win, to have an older man showing just the sheer joy of it. I do hope that means dad dancing will become a thing of the past.” Ballroom dance was so much more than glitz and sequins, she said. “I hope this will inspire men to give it a go because it is so good for your health and your relationships and it is so much fun.” She said Bailey confounded expectations about older people and “that is something we as an organisation are massively into. What is beautiful? What is sexy? It can be so much more than what the mainstream would have you believe.” Tracie Gooch, of Tracie’s Latin Club in Southampton, said: “I think it will definitely inspire men and I think we’ll see it more in January.” Already there were older women buying online beginners’ dance lessons for their husbands for Christmas. “I am sure there are people out there that have bought and looked online for dance classes because of Bill Bailey.” She said everyone she knew had been rooting for Bailey after his “phenomenal” quickstep in week two. The younger contestants, Hrvy and Maisie Smith, were stronger dancers – but Bailey captured “imaginations and hearts” she said. All dance schools have had a rollercoaster year of being open with reduced numbers and then closed offering lessons on Zoom and prerecords. “Who knows what the new year will bring but we’re now ready for everything,” said Gooch."
"Barney Bubbles was once described as the “missing link between pop and culture” producing record sleeves, T-shirts and stage sets for the likes of Hawkwind, Elvis Costello, Ian Dury and Nick Lowe. He also directed the 1981 video for the Specials song Ghost Town, featuring the band glumly crammed into a 1961 Vauxhall Cresta being driven through the empty streets of London. On Monday, it will be announced that an archive of Bubbles’ work is now owned by the UK public, as part of a list of treasures by artists including Manet, Rembrandt and Chagall which are going into public collections thanks to the UK’s cultural gifts and acceptance in lieu (AiL) schemes. The latter scheme, created in Lloyd George’s 1910 “people’s budget”, allows cultural objects be left to the UK as a way of offsetting or settling inheritance tax bills. The cultural gifts scheme was introduced in 2013, and allows people to leave treasures in their lifetime. The 2019-20 year was a record one, an annual report reveals, with objects worth nearly £65m left to the public, settling tax of £40m. The Belinda Syme archive of Bubbles’ work and paraphernalia was comparatively small in terms of tax settlement (£16,500) but it is arguably one of the most fascinating collections on the list, shining light on a figure who his many fans say deserves to be better known. Born Colin Fulcher, Bubbles produced distinctive designs in the 70s and 80s for a huge swathe of punk, post-punk and new wave acts. He also designed the masthead for NME and the archer logo for Strongbow cider. The science fiction writer Michael Moorcock described Bubbles’ record covers as “lasting images for fleeting times” while Factory Records designer Peter Saville called him the “missing link between pop and culture.” Bubbles rarely signed anything he produced, shunned publicity – apart from an interview with The Face – and took his own life in 1983, aged just 41. The archive includes sketchbooks, drawing equipment, collages, photographs, badges, stickers, album covers and his library of reference books. It has been permanently allocated to Liverpool John Moores University in accordance with the wish of the donor. Edward Harley, chair of the AiL panel, said two-thirds of allocations had been made to institutions outside London. “The variety of objects remains as diverse as ever, and it is particularly exciting that the number of institutions receiving items through the scheme continues to grow.” Harley also highlighted significant acquisitions made to national museums in devolved nations. Wales has received an important Manet portrait of his cousin Jules Dejouy and a Corot landscape; Scotland a gouache titled L’Écuyère (The Horse Rider) by Marc Chagall; Northern Ireland six etchings by Rembrandt. Paintings by Leonard Rosoman that include the first gay kiss in British theatre history have been allocated to the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, West Sussex. Other archives now owned publicly include those of Lord Carrington, foreign secretary under Margaret Thatcher, which has gone to the Churchill Archives Centre; and barrister Jeremy Hutchinson, who defended Penguin in the Lady Chatterley’s Lover trial, which has gone to the University of Sussex. The annual report reveals that this is the first year that the maximum amount of tax which can be settled, £40m, was utilised. Among the more eclectic objects left is a collection of more than 50 fossils found in a West Lothian quarry which includes Westlothiana lizziae – or “Lizzie the Lizard” – thought to be the oldest known reptile. The collection was allocated to National Museums Scotland."
"A chill wind is blowing through Sydney’s theatres this week, with major productions cancelled in the wake of the Covid lockdown on Sydney’s northern beaches and the city-wide outbreak which has so far infected 90 people. The freeze is on for Disney’s Frozen, which has cancelled all scheduled performances up to the planned Christmas closure on 23 December. Prior to this announcement, made on Monday, the show played to in excess of 1,700 people per performance, under the NSW Health Department exemption for performing arts venues. Frozen is hoping to reopen on 26 December. Magic Mike Live did not open in the Entertainment Quarter in Sydney’s Moore Park on 20 December as advertised; instead, its producers hope to reopen on 27 December. The musical Pippin, which has been playing at the Lyric Theatre, has also closed its doors until 27 December “out of an abundance of caution”, said Graeme Kearns, the CEO of Foundation Theatres which operates the Capitol and Lyric Theatres. “It’s been a rough few days,” Kearns said. “The venues asked all patrons from the northern beaches not to attend the theatres over the weekend and relocated a small number of staff from the northern beaches into the city. “I think we have broken a lot of hearts and for that I am sorry,” Kearns said. “But it was the socially responsible thing to do. We want to do our part for NSW health and safety.” Christmas is a time when family groups come to the theatre, often for the first time, said Kearns. “It’s one of the great strengths of Sydney; families really come out for shows pre-Christmas, but I can assure people we have the capacity to reschedule tickets so they can come again soon. We know clusters can pop up and we are ready for that.” At the time of writing, Sydney Theatre Company’s (STC) production of The Picture of Dorian Gray in the Roslyn Packer Theatre is going ahead as advertised, with the reduced capacity of 75% – or 672 seats – mandated by the current NSW Health exemptions for some theatres. The production is a one-woman show starring Eryn Jean Norvill playing 26 different characters. The Roslyn Packer Theatre has maintained strict protocols: Covid marshals ensure all audience members are signed in with a QR code and no one can enter the theatre unmasked. Foyer bars are closed and ushers enforce mask-wearing during the show. Last weekend’s performances of My Brilliant Career at Belvoir theatre were cancelled due to uncertainty about the cluster. But a show is resuming on Tuesday and Wednesday night at 75% capacity – with masks mandatory – before a scheduled break until 29 December. Belvoir asks its audiences to bring their own mask and wear it at all times while in the building. The theatre’s bars are open, however, and guests are allowed to “raise” their masks while drinking. “Belvoir is a small theatre, and we have a Department of Health exemption for 75% maximum capacity although we’ve elected to run at a lower capacity for the next couple of weeks,” said Sue Donnelly, executive director at Belvoir. “This allows for social distancing in our theatre and foyer. Belvoir has strong Covid-safe policies, including being the first theatre to announce that masks would be mandatory.” Both Belvoir and STC are refunding or exchanging tickets to any patrons who reside in or have visited the northern beaches recently, in line with NSW state guidelines for self-isolation.  The recent outbreak serves to remind theatre producers that their business model sits on a knife edge. Quick lockdowns of entire local government areas can seriously impact audience numbers and send box office staff into frenzied rebooking. Worse still, cast and crew can suddenly find themselves on the other side of a line that can’t be crossed. Among those most concerned with the immediate future will be Opera Australia, which plans to open its production of The Merry Widow on 5 January, and Sydney festival 2021, whose productions – all locally sourced due to the pandemic – open in venues across Sydney from 6 January. Across Sydney, it will be a quieter-than-usual festive season. Citing NSW Health advice, City of Sydney has cancelled all live music and pop-up shows, including roving Christmas-themed performances in the city centre and the daily light shows around the Christmas tree in Martin Place. The tree remains in place. Christmas is not entirely cancelled."
"Late-night hosts returned to the air on Monday evening for the new year, although 2021 was already looking a lot like the 2020 mess just left behind. “We’re off to a fresh start,” joked Stephen Colbert on the Late Show, “with a raging pandemic and a president who’s trying to steal the election”. “Turns out 2020 is dropping some bonus tracks,” he added, as on Sunday the Washington Post released a recording of a phone call between the president and Georgia’s secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, who oversaw the state’s election, recount and recount of the recount. During the hour-long call, which took place on Saturday, Trump explicitly demanded Raffensperger “find” 11,000 votes to overturn Biden’s victory in the state, invoked numerous conspiracy theories, and threatened criminal charges against Raffensperger if he did not assist the president in his attempt to nullify the election. “Buckle up everybody, because this call is like if Watergate and the Ukraine scandal had a baby that they made on the Access Hollywood bus,” Colbert joked. “When you’re a star, they let you do it!” While the call was ominous – the president pleaded with a state official and his lawyers “fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break” – the contents were often nonsensical and rambling. “If he wants to steal an election he really needs to sound less like your grandpa complaining about his phone,” Colbert joked. New year, same old conflicts in Washington, reported Seth Meyers on Monday night, as House Republicans and a dozen GOP senators prepared to vote symbolically to refuse to certify the election results. “Virtually the entirety of the Republican party has started off the year by making it clear, in case it wasn’t clear before, that they’re actively trying to destroy democracy,” the Late Night host explained. “Also this story is yet another reminder that while we do a big countdown and watch a ball drop, the beginning of new years tend to be a lot like the year that just ended.” “Predictably, 2021 is picking up right where 2020 left off, with the Republican party callously refusing to do anything about the raging pandemic that’s killed 350,000 Americans or the botched vaccine rollout, choosing instead to focus on their unhinged attempts to light our democracy on fire,” Meyers added, before diving into the Trump-Raffensperger call. Though congressional Republicans such as senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley have claimed election integrity as the reason for sustaining Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud, “with this call to Raffensperger, Trump ripped off the mask and revealed what’s really going on,” Meyers said. “He made it crystal clear exactly what those 140 GOP House members and a dozen senators will be supporting on Wednesday. They’re not standing up for election integrity or trying to restore faith in our democracy, they’re petty henchmen in a harebrained scheme to steal an election hatched by a deranged wannabe tyrant who talks like a mafia boss with a head injury.” During the hour-long call, Trump threatened Raffensperger with criminal charges and invoked numerous debunked election conspiracy theories. “I just like to imagine what everyone else was doing on the other end of the phone call while Trump was rambling like a lunatic for an hour,” Meyers said. “It’s like when you put your grandpa on speaker phone while you do household chores and then he just casually confesses to a crime in the middle.” “While most of us are back to reality today, Donald Trump is further from it than he’s ever been,” Jimmy Kimmel said on Monday night, referencing the Raffensperger call. “I listened it to it twice,” he said, “I listened to the whole thing like it was a surprise Taylor Swift album.” During the call, the president “tried everything”, Kimmel said. “He bragged, he challenged, he threatened, he told the secretary of state he’d come to Georgia and eat all their peaches, nothing. “He really is the weakest, whiniest little dictator imaginable,” he added. “If you haven’t listened to it, listen to it, it’s pathetic.” And yet, numerous congressional Republicans intend to vote in favor of Trump’s attempt to overturn democracy this week, citing baseless election fraud claims. “During his last ‘perfect call’ – the one he got impeached for – Republicans lined up and said ‘we can’t impeach, Congress shouldn’t decide who’s president, the people should decide!’” Kimmel said. “And now these same Congress people are like, ‘what, the people decided on Biden? In that case, let’s let Congress decide who’s the president.’”"
"Once upon a time, in the old, old days when the mouse was a barber, and the donkey ran errands, and the tortoise baked bread, there was a great mountain called Kaf Daği on the border of the spirit realm, from which many of the fairytales and myths of the Middle East sprang forth. Today, Kaf Daği is thought to be somewhere in the Caucasus mountain range that separates the Black Sea from the Caspian. In this magical place – also known as Jabal Qaf in Arabic and Kuh-e Qaf in Persian – princes are cursed by witches, who turn them into stags; beautiful maidens are birthed from oranges; and sultans, courtiers, slaves and farmers alike are at the mercy of the peri (fairies) and ifrit (demons) that populate the Turkish fairyland. The oral folktales of the Anatolian plateau are a remarkable blend of storytelling motifs and traditions, drawing on the Arabian Nights and Brothers Grimm, as well as Kurdish, Persian, Slavonic, Jewish and Romanian influences. Dr Ignatuis Kunos, a Hungarian Turkologist who was one of the first academics to collect and write some of them down in the 1880s, compared the treasures of Turkish folklore to “precious stones lying neglected in the byways of philology for want of gleaners to gather them in”. He worried that the steady creep of modernisation – particularly the railway – would erode Anatolia’s cultural heritage. Happily, more than a century later, the oral storytelling tradition has survived, and a mammoth academic project called Masal is collecting and indexing a goal of 10,000 stories to preserve for future generations. Members of the public and academics from university literature departments around the country can submit a fairytale to Masal’s online portal, where it is then examined by three rounds of researchers and language editors. The project is funded by the Atatürk Cultural Centre in what is the first undertaking of its kind in Turkey. The stories are indexed according to which of seven regions they are from and which of five different types of stories: animal tales, magical or extraordinary tales, realistic tales and humorous tales. Zincirlemeli tales follow a strict formula, almost like a poem, in which characters and events at the beginning and end form mirror images. There are often several different variants of one story, requiring painstaking cross-referencing to figure out how a tale can differ over time from one region to another: there are 20 different versions of Tın Tın Kabacık, about two little girls abandoned by their father, in the province of Muğla alone. Many stories and poems over the years have morphed into Turkish from original Kurdish, Laz, Armenian and Circassian versions. If a submitted tale is approved it becomes part of Masal’s online database, which will eventually be available to the public. More than 3,300 tales have been collected from 77 different areas to date, and the project’s directors hope the corpus will be completed by February 2022. Motifs such as magic carpets, animals and birds gifted with speech and enchanted mirrors, apples and pomegranates echo throughout the canon. Characters who brave the dragons and giants of Kaf Daği or survive a trek across the desert are rewarded with marriage proposals in beautiful gardens, and the phoenix-like Zumrutu Anka or Simurgh bird is always on hand to help a hero out of a tight spot. The tales can be ugly, too. Black or Moorish servants, Jews and elderly witches almost always take the part of the villain; pashas have their innocent wives stoned to death and enemies ripped apart by wild horses; a sparrow comes to tell a young woman that death is her kismet (fate). Turkish fairytales also took on an important political dimension during the early days of the republic, when modern Turkey’s founder, Mustafa Kamal Atatürk, attempted to force what was left of the Ottoman empire into the modern world. Folk culture was rejected as backwards, and Turkish scholars such as Pertev Naili Boratav, who pioneered the study of folktales, became a target of Turkish nationalists in the 1940s for highlighting the country’s ethnic diversity in his work. “Boratav’s meticulous scholarship and courageous public intellectualism inspired me,” said author Kaya Genç, whose book The Lion and the Nightingale criss-crosses modern Turkey in an examination of the “contradictory soul of the Turkish nation”. “In folk tales, the heroes are mostly outsiders who suffer the violence of powerful autocrats; for politicians, their defiant tone is dangerous,” he said. Dr Mehmet Naci Önal, a lecturer at Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University’s department of Turkish language and literature, who serves as one of Masal’s researchers, hopes that academics, writers and artists will be able to draw on the project’s database of stories for generations to come. “Fairytales teach us to wonder, to use reason, to be patient, to dream, to overcome obstacles, not to be intimidated, to struggle, to be good people, to fight against evil, to tell the truth, to detect lies and deceit, to resist, and to listen. These values are universal human values: times change, people don’t.”"
"Every Christmas, after the ham’s been carved and everyone’s stopped fighting, people all over the world sit down to watch people fight all over again in the iconic festive action film Die Hard. But we’ve been holding on for dear life this year, flailing without a harness over 2021’s gaping chasm of uncertainty – so I suggest giving John McClane a rest this Friday in favour of a different snowy action flick. Instead, I’m dreaming of a white, muscular, mountainous Christmas, courtesy of the Sylvester Stallone mountain climbing action film Cliffhanger. Sure, it’s not technically set during the holidays – but there is a lot of snow (which according to the giant inflatable snowman on my street still has festive connotations, even in Australia), and it does have some explosive Christmas sentiment. For me, that’s enough. In Cliffhanger, which is streaming in Australia on Stan, Stallone plays experienced mountain climber Gabe Walker, who actually only walks in one scene. Generally he’s ... hanging, and climbing rocks, really fast. When we meet him, he’s clambering up an intimidating slab of rock to rescue his mate and his mate’s girlfriend Sarah, who has inexplicably carried a small puppy soft toy all the way to the top of a big stone pillar. With its boneless padded body, the puppy looks better equipped than Sarah for what’s about to happen – namely Stallone and his worthless, ripped biceps dropping them down a vast geological expanse, to die at the base of an oversized tombstone. The traumatised Stallone abandons his grieving friends and girlfriend for a few months, before being lured back by the idea of taking her with him down a shame spiral. Soon though, a bunch of baddies botch a mid-flight heist and he’s roped into tracking down $100m stuffed into suitcases littered across Colorado’s Rocky Mountains – played here by the Italian Alps, which are significantly more expressive than Stallone. The film is all action. There’s truly excellent stunt work, including a guy climbing along a wire between two planes without a harness (allegedly the most expensive stunt of all time, at US $1m), and Stallone doing one of those classic runs along an exploding rope bridge. There’s also mind-bendingly dumb-but-great fight scenes. At one point Stallone manages to lift up a baddie and impale him on a blunt stalactite; and at another he goes full Kill Runnings and repeatedly punches one henchman in the head while simultaneously using the man as a bobsleigh. There’s also a really dramatic bat cave scene, which isn’t scary because bats are actually quite cute. A couple of deaths that raise the stakes are a real bummer – particularly the old mountain rescue guy who likes doing abstract paintings of monkeys (I guess he just likes things that climb good?) and there’s lots of blood-splattered snow. The only reprieve from this ridiculous testosterone avalanche is John Lithgow who, playing the film’s villain Qualen, manages to chew enough snow-covered scenery to give himself brain freeze. As well as being a solid entry to the canon of British-accented evil masterminds, Qualen embodies the same egotistical rich guy disregard for human life displayed in the currently streaming, mountaineering documentaries Free Solo, Mountain and The Summit. Those films focus on (mostly) dudes, whose lust for conquest and disregard for the awesome power of nature frequently claims their own lives, as well as those of their loved ones and exploited sherpas. In this context, Qualen’s suitcases full of money are metaphors for the folly of spending squillions of dollars to line up and take selfies at the top of big, terrifying hills. Which makes it especially satisfying to watch Stallone blow up Qualen and his luggage. No Cliffhanger isn’t set at Christmas like Die Hard. But the way Qualen and his henchmen recklessly charge around the mountain looking for big expensive boxes feels analogous to the Christmas shopping rush, which has claimed the lives and sanity of many. And at the end of the film, after all the suitcases full of money have been destroyed and Stallone has found reconciliation with his old friends and guilt, it’s apparent that all that really matters is holding onto the people you love, rather than dropping them off a cliff. Maybe Cliffhanger is a Christmas film after all."
"The Black Country Living Museum is an open-air attraction that tells the story of Britain’s early manufacturing history, set in the defiantly unstarry town of Dudley, in England’s industrial Midlands. Among the exhibits that have earned it a clutch of awards are two mine shafts, a lime kiln and a collection of postwar trolley buses. This month the visitor attraction gained another, more unexpected accolade, becoming – it believes – the most popular museum in the world on TikTok. It has more than 350,000 followers worldwide, and its short video clips, often featuring a cast of re-enactors in historic dress, can attract many more viewers. A recent video featuring a character called “1920s grandad” offering advice in a tar-thick Black Country accent has been viewed more than 2.2m times. “My favourite TikTok account giving me LIFE right now,” reads one of the clip’s almost 12,000 comments. For the hard-pressed heritage sector, struggling perennially to attract younger visitors and this year reeling from on-off Covid-related closure, this level of engagement with a new audience represents a kind of alchemy. Abby Bird, the museum’s communications manager, admits she had no expectation of such popularity when she launched the TikTok account in late August. “I remember thinking I would be really happy if we got 10,000 followers by Christmas,” she says. In fact, she cleared that hurdle after only her second post, a video of some of the museum’s actors strutting through its historic streets to a booming K-pop soundtrack, in parody of a street-style meme popular on the site. The museum has been named one of TikTok’s 100 top UK accounts for 2020, and after extensive searching, Bird can find no other museum in the world with more followers. The push to get on TikTok, she says, was lockdown itself, when the museum’s reduced schedule left her with some free time. Bird, 31, is a self-confessed TikTok addict, but not all her colleagues got it at first. “Once I explained the process to senior staff, they were very much like: ‘Well I don’t really understand how it works, and I don’t use it personally, but I trust you.’ Part of us being accessible as a museum is being in the spaces that young people are digitally.” That challenge is well understood by Adam Koszary, who had a brief and surreal moment of internet celebrity in 2018 when he was social media manager of the Museum of Rural English Life. One of his tweets, featuring an impressively proportioned sheep, became such a huge global meme that the billionaire Tesla-founder, Elon Musk, briefly changed his profile picture to that of the museum. Now in charge of social media for the Royal Academy in London, Koszary frequently advises other museums and galleries seeking to make their communications more effective. It is ironic, he says, that despite being in the business of telling stories, many “are still playing catchup to social media in a ton of ways. Even if they have massive followings, they’re still not quite connecting.” Both he and Bird agree that the key is in what Koszary calls “meeting the internet halfway”, taking time to discover what works on different platforms, and committing the resources to make the institution’s content and tone translate to that medium. That won’t always mean a sassy riff on viral memes, though the Yorkshire Museum has kicked off a lively Twitter dialogue by challenging other institutions to regular “curator battles” in which they are invited to link to items from their collections. Koszary points to the National Trust as an institution that has done “an amazing job” balancing its members’ interest in nature and history with the need to communicate its properties’ sometimes controversial backstories. The question is how to translate a viral following on social media into real value. “I suppose it really depends on how you define success as a museum,” says Bird. “Just because our doors are closed at the moment, that doesn’t mean our job stops. We’re focusing on visits to the website, conversations happening, the number of comments – all of those are really important indicators that people are taking in the story. And I have absolute confidence that that is going to lead to more visits.”"
"Digital-only performances and live streaming to a virtual audience are set to become a permanent feature of the live performance landscape, long after the Covid-19 pandemic comes under control, and leading the way in this new era of post-pandemic art is a new gallery and live performance space in Sydney’s inner city suburb of Chippendale. Phoenix Central Park was conceived and funded by philanthropist Judith Neilson, the founder and owner of Sydney’s White Rabbit gallery, which houses one of the largest collections in the world of contemporary Chinese art. With daughter Beau Neilson as Phoenix’s creative director, the new project, just a few streets away from White Rabbit, continues the family’s commitment to providing creative experiences in the visual and performing arts to the public, free of charge. Beau Neilson told Guardian Australia Phoenix’s ongoing operations would be wholly funded by the Judith Neilson Foundation, with no funding from government sources; a financial model highly unusual in the heavily subsided Australian cultural landscape. Neilson admits the logistics of offering free performances to the public once venues return to 100% capacity have not yet been fully determined. “I think there are a few different ways we can do it,” she said. “We’re looking at having multiple sessions in an evening – we would still film a component of [the performance] but we will have small audiences, so there might be a six o’clock session for example a nine o’clock session. “We’re also looking at some walkthrough performances, where audiences could walk through the space and experience different things in different parts of the space, where we could ensure we could manage a steady flow. “But we’re still working on the practical elements of the details of making all this possible.” The doors to Phoenix opened in February 2020 with a performance by experimental music group Ensemble Offspring, then promptly closed as the nation began the Covid-19 shutdown. The project has since filmed a number of Covid-safe audience-free performances and posted them on its YouTube channel. “At the point restrictions came into place, we were still finding our feet,” said Neilson. “But within a matter of days, we had embraced the full digital possibilities of the space, which, fortuitously, had been considered as part of the building’s design.” Live audiences are not expected to walk through the venue’s doors again until mid-2021 (Guardian Australia visited it by invitation). But Phoenix’s function and design, which has already collected a slew of architecture awards, has been built around the assumption that performance spaces of the future must be pandemic-proof. Sophisticated technology to produce high-quality digital and live streaming performances has been embedded into the building’s finely sculpted bones. It is this principle – that resilience is not enough to ensure future crises will not bring the cultural economy to its knees – that was touched on during a parliamentary inquiry hearing into Australia’s creative and cultural industries and institutions in Canberra last November. “This is not just about resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same, whereas anti-fragile gets better,” said Kate Fielding, the program director for independent arts and cultural think tank A New Approach, at the inquiry. “When we talk about anti-fragile, we’re talking about those things which benefit from disruption – that is, they thrive in disruption. They are nimble and responsive and able to adapt to a situation.” The complex, which reportedly cost $32m to build before a single art work was installed (Neilson would not confirm the building’s cost) earned its designers, Durbach Block Jaggers and John Wardle Architects a number of national and international architectural prizes, including the prestigious NSW Architecture Medallion. On Friday, Phoenix Central Park will mark its shift back into semi-normal mode, with the digital premiere of a new Sydney Dance Company (SDC) work commissioned by the gallery and choreographed by Rafael Bonachela. The work, Touch, not only celebrates the first time SDC artists have been allowed to make physical contact with each other in nine months, but also serves as a virtual tour of the buildings’ interiors, which are based on the German concept of “gesamtkunstwerk” – that is, a total work of art. The stairwells, dressing rooms, car park and basement, as well as the auditorium with its soaring bell-shaped ceiling have all become sets in the SDC’s short production. “Phoenix is an inspirational space, which embodies the nexus between architecture and creativity,” said SDC’s creative director Bonachela. “Working with the Sydney Dance Company dancers to bring to life a creative response to Phoenix Central Park was a delight. Contemporary dance reflects the new, the future, the vanguard and it was incredible to have the opportunity to make a short film driven by the sinuous lines and surprises around each corner of this breathtaking building.”"
"Jason Williamson, lead vocalist of English electronic punk music duo Sleaford Mods, was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire in 1970. He moved to Nottingham in 1995, where he began working with rock band Spiritualized and electronic duo Bent. In 2009, he met Andrew Fearn and they released the first Sleaford Mods album, Divide and Exit, in 2014. They have since been called “the voice of Britain” by their fans and “the world’s greatest rock’n’roll band” by Iggy Pop. Their latest album, Spare Ribs, is out now on Rough Trade Records. The band will tour the UK in late 2021.  Over three episodes, this series talks about Rupert Murdoch’s rise and fall, including that massive scandal with Rebekah Brooks. It also looks at the inauguration of Tony Blair into the fold. Murdoch didn’t usually go with [people] perceived to be socialist leaders, so I thought that part was interesting. We now know Blair is very much a centrist, but this series covered his initial invitation to a Murdoch party. It was powerful, the way it showed footage of Blair stepping on to a boat, and there was no going back. It’s really interesting to see how power influences modern politics. It’s about Lanegan’s life, his childhood, the history of his band Screaming Trees, and the eventual heroin affliction that he went through. I wasn’t really a massive fan of the band, but the book is really good. It calmly and matter-of-factly hammers out the experience of a heroin addict. It also paints the scene of the early days of grunge in Seattle, which was really interesting and struck a chord. I connect with the idea of people having a hard time trying to get somewhere, and being affected by childhood trauma. [The book is] a realistic portrayal of someone trying to get somewhere in music. I can’t live without it, to be honest. I’ve tried toast – it’s no good. My mum made it better than my dad. My dad was terrible. He would just boil it. My partner does the same. You just put it in a pot and stir it slowly over a low heat until it thickens. I use oat milk. It’s got to have set, thick honey in it too. I need it to operate: I clean everyone’s room and get all the kids’ clothes out, and you need a bellyful of something. I’m bang into her at the minute. I’m listening to her second album, Party. That’s not left me all year, more so than anything else, music-wise. I listen to lots of drill and grime, I follow [music websites] Trench and GRM Daily, but with this album, I’ve gotten back into singer-songwriter stuff. I saw her at a festival in Tasmania at the start of 2020. She was brilliant: off-the-wall, a bit random but in a good way. It’s folk, a little psychedelic, very minimalist. I know everyone uses it, it’s no shakes, but I spend seven hours a day there. The discourse on it is quite varied and draws me in, whether it’s the current political situation or trying to keep positive through Covid. You can vent your frustrations. You can go there for laughs. I tend to spend most of my time in that space. It’s kind of your only outlet to argue with people you would never be able to approach in real life, like celebrities and politicians. I’m interested in the idea of what hell is. I’m not a religious person, but I am a big believer in hell on Earth. This film tells the story of a van full of coppers driving home one night through the woods. They stumble on a satanic ritual and walk into this brilliant depiction of hell. Absolutely chaotic. People animalised, multiple deaths, you name it. Visually, it’s really unsettling and surreal, but a real comment on human nature."
"Stephen Colbert scrapped a taped monologue and went live at 11.35pm ET on Wednesday night, hours after a mob of armed Trump supporters stormed the Capitol at the president’s behest. “I really want to do the show we’re about to do and I also really don’t want to do the show we’re about to do,” a visibly shaken Colbert said, “because, Lord have mercy, there are some dark subjects that we talk about on the show occasionally, but I’ve rarely been as upset as I am tonight.” The Late Show host then spoke directly to those responsible for inciting the mob, starting with Trump’s allies in Congress who have tolerated or sustained his baseless rejection of Joe Biden’s victory. “Hey, Republicans who supported this president, especially the ones in the joint session of Congress today, have you had enough?” he asked. “After five years of coddling this president’s fascist rhetoric, guess whose followers want to burn down the Reichstag? Because today, the US Capitol was overrun for the first time since 1814, and a woman died. Who could have seen this coming? Everyone? Even dummies like me. This is the most shocking, most tragic, least surprising thing I’ve ever seen. “For years now, people have been telling you cowards that if you let the president lie about our democracy over and over and then join him in that lie and say he’s right when you know for a fact that he is not, there will be a terrible price to pay,” Colbert continued. “But you just never thought you’d have to pay it, too. I really do hope you’re enjoying those tax cuts. And those judges, cause those judges are really going to be working hard. They’re going to be busy throwing these idiots in jail.” Colbert then turned on Fox News: “Do you think maybe years of peddling his conspiracy theories had anything to do with this? ‘Oh, but come on, man, you know we have our opinion side and our news side. And come on, we’re just trying to turn a coin for uncle Rupee, sell a few lubricated catheters.’ Like those lubricated catheters, you know where you can stick your excuses and you can skip the lubrication.” Colbert kept going, pressing Republican senators who until late Wednesday indulged the president’s doubt-mongering over the election: “A little question for the Republican senators who helped foment this insurrection: why’d you run away? I mean, these are your peeps, they love you. Why don’t you hang out with your buddies, Marsha Blackburn, Kelly Loeffler, Ron Johnson, John ‘not that Kennedy’ Kennedy? Because you can run all you want, for the rest of your lives, but you can never escape the responsibility of what you brought upon American democracy today. “This was never some sort of peaceful protest,” he concluded. “This was Charlottesville come home to roost on Capitol Hill.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers issued a sober, measured rebuke of any attempt to minimize what occurred at the Capitol. “I think it’s important, as the first draft of history is being written, and as we’re all processing what we witnessed today, to be as plain-spoken and clear-eyed as possible,” he said. “What we saw today was a violent insurgency, an attempt to overthrow the legitimately elected government of the United States, and it was incited, directed and encouraged by President Donald Trump and more than a few members of the Republican rightwing media.” Trump responded to the mob, which replaced an American flag with a Trump one, brandished Confederate and QAnon paraphernalia, and ransacked congressional offices, with a video of support: “I love you, you’re very special, I know how you feel.” “And he does,” Meyers said. “He knows how they feel, because he spent four years telling them in great and odious detail how they should feel. So we can be shocked, but we can’t be surprised. The president wanted this. He directed it, supported it, he incited it and encouraged it.” Meyers called for Trump’s immediate removal from office and for prosecution – “anything less is tacit permission to continue to use his office and his influence after he leaves office to foment sedition and dismantle democracy” – and redirected attention to the overshadowed runoff races in Georgia, in which the Rev Raphael Warnock became the first black Democrat from any southern state elected to the Senate. “Multiracial, pluralistic democracy is fragile, and precious, and it requires our vigilant stewardship and protection,” Meyers concluded. “And anyone not willing to forward that project with the fullness of their effort must be shamed and disgraced and removed from office.” On the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon struck a much softer if still grave tone. “In times like these I think to myself, ‘How is this happening? How can this be happening?’” he said. “But I’m also thinking, how can I help? And being here tonight, talking to you at home and reassuring you that we’re gonna be OK, and this is not what our country is about, is how I can help. “Today was not patriotism; today was terrorism,” he added, then echoed Biden’s words for Americans to step up. “We’ve seen it over and over again during this pandemic, from the frontline workers to the cashiers at grocery stores to everyone delivering food or raising money for people who need it. We are best when we work together and step up.” He also reiterated the president-elect’s words that “enough is enough is enough”. “I believe that is what a majority of this country has been saying, has been screaming, for a long time now. Enough is enough,” Fallon concluded. “Today was a disgrace. Today was disappointing. But sadly, today was not a surprise. But it’s important to remember that this is not who we are. I assure you that there are more good people then bad. And good will prevail.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the “treason finale of the Donald Trump era” with palpable anger. “The police were very laidback compared to the Black Lives Matter protests,” he said, as some were seen taking selfies with the rioters and opening the gates for them. “It was a terrible day for this country. Our president and the scumbags who have kept this stolen election charade going – that’s you, Josh Hawley, that’s you, Ted Cruz – either intentionally or wildly irresponsibly lit these fires to start a war just to distract us from the fact that Donald Trump lost the election.” Kimmel called Trump, Cruz, Representative Jim Jordan and other Republicans who courted conspiratorial or delusional support based on lies and fear “not Americans”. “There is no ‘we the people’,” in that ideology, he said. “It’s ‘me the people’.”"
"In the films of late New Wave director Éric Rohmer, the summer holiday is a site for unmet desires, moral crises and inertia. His young, confused creations live in the languorous space where personal ethics slip and loneliness and listlessness are magnified under the hot sun. With endless leisure time stretching out before them, they stare into the void or entangle themselves in fraught romantic relations – as in the case in his charming yet bittersweet 1983 film Pauline at the Beach (Pauline à la Plage, the third addition to Rohmer’s Comedies and Proverbs sextet), which is currently streaming on Stan. It’s the end of summer and 15-year-old Pauline (Amanda Langlet) has come to a resort town in Normandy to holiday with her older cousin Marion, a fashion designer (Arielle Dombasle, who, with her bulging coral necklace, exuberant hand gestures and fuzzy, blonde blow-out, is almost – but not quite – a caricature of a French fashion person). On the beach, they run into Marion’s old ex, the sharp-jawed, practical Pierre (Pascal Greggory), who in turn bumps into an acquaintance, Henri (Féodor Atkine), a peripatetic (and lecherous) ethnographer. Together they convene at Henri’s house for dinner and discuss love and romance – the kind of earnest conversation that can only arise out of hurried intimacy. Some lines of inquiry: is love all heat and flash, or can it swell slowly? Does love spring from a chance encounter with a total stranger, or only with someone you know? Is blind faith better than pragmatism? Marion, recently separated from her husband, wants to “burn” with love. “I need rapturous delight!” she cries later in the film. Pierre seeks a dependable partner. Henri wants to remain unmoored, led only by his desires. Pauline, a mostly quiet interloper in these disclosures, is looking for romance that extends beyond a glance with a 17-year-old in a restaurant the previous summer. “A wagging tongue bites itself” – a loose translation of a quote by 12th-century poet Chrétien de Troyes – is the proverb that prefaces Pauline at the Beach, where misunderstandings, deceit and self-deception make for lightly farcical ends. Everyone is accused of being in love or infatuated with the wrong person, each slinging choice words about another’s dalliances, which come to involve the town’s ruddy-cheeked sweet-seller and for Pauline, a teenage boy called Sylvain. It’s a cutting yet kind film about how age doesn’t necessitate enlightenment, where the lies of adults collide with the end of childhood innocence. Outside of these amorous antics, Pauline at the Beach hums with the languidness of summer, punctuated by swims, al fresco breakfasts and the infrequent windsurfing lesson. Rohmer, a devout Catholic, saw cinema as a means to faithfully replicate the beauty of God’s creation. In Pauline at the Beach, this creed results in plenty of understated, seasonal splendour: misty ocean vistas, purple hydrangeas in bloom and metallic bathers that stick to bronzed, salt-sprayed limbs. Pauline at the Beach is a good place to start with the work of Rohmer. Like most of his films, talk is eloquent and incessant; the subjects are sex, relationships and fidelity. His characters are tormented by indecision, tempted by their desires (often by a type frequently found in his earlier films: the incorrigible but opaque woman), and even his most despondent individuals still cling to a scrap of hope, and perhaps some magical thinking. Pauline, though, is a rare Rohmer heroine – clear-eyed and unwilling to be sucked into the adults’ charade. “You tell your stories,” Pauline says at the holiday group’s first dinner, as if in premonition of the narratives to be spun. While there might not be much guidance from those “oldies” in her orbit, Pauline does receive a sage lesson about self-delusion. At the trip’s abrupt end, Marion tells Pauline they should convince themselves of contradictory tales about their messy summer romances, in order to assuage their heartbreak. “That way we’ll both be happy,” she asserts, as they drive away."
"Surge by Jay Bernard (2019) Jay Bernard’s powerful and award-winning 2019 poetry collection, Surge,  grapples with the loss of black life. The collection starts by looking over historical scars – “remember we were brought here from the clear waters of our dreams, that we might be named, numbered and forgotten” – but soon the pages are charred and bloody with the presence of new death. The horrors of the night where “flames dem ah fly” are imagined with both tenderness and frankness. These poems often speak in the voice of the New Cross party attendees. Its strong sense of place, its patois, its demand for justice, its curiosity (“Will anybody speak of this?”) are reminders that four decades on, the tragedy remains an open wound. Watch Jay Bernard read from Surge here New Cross Fire Page One by Sir Collins This little-known but significant album was produced and compiled by Sir Collins, who died in 2018, as a tribute to his son, Steve, who, aged 17, lost his life in the fire. Side A features the youthful vocals of his son who sings, chants and toasts on roots and reggae instrumentals recorded as a child and teenager. Steve’s innocent recital of the alphabet is both sweet and sombre on Teach the World ABC while in United We Stand, Sir Collins calls out the names of the New Cross fire victims. Side B covers Bob Marley’s iconic Exodus, a song about freedom, while Peace and Love 1 is a buoyant calypso track that celebrates life with the joyous sound of steel pans. New Craas Massahkah by Linton Kwesi Johnson Celebrated poet Linton Kwesi Johnson’s poem is somewhat of a sibling to his Five Nights of Bleeding, in which he recounts the Brixton riots that occurred in the spring of the same year. Steve McQueen movingly featured the poem in Alex Wheatle in his Small Axe series. The poem illuminates the frustrations felt by black Britain that wanted answers. Beyond its lyrical imagery of melancholy blues and fiery reds, it tells of what followed that fateful night, as Johnson remembers how the event was handled officially. “Plenty papers print pure lie,” he laments, “and the police dem plot and scheme.” In his celebrated dub style, he paints a picture of resistance that sought to remedy the structural biases that exposed the black community to injury and harm. THIRTEEN DEAD 1981 by Keith Piper British artist Keith Piper’s mixed-media artwork features pictures of victims on postcards, each placed on brown and charred patterned wallpaper and skirting board. Hand written in capital letters, next to each image is the nameand the age at which “Babylon snuffed [them] out” and the repeated phrase: “Send this one back to the people and let the people demand an answer.” The artwork was recently exhibited at Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry, together with seminal works from the BLK Art Group, which was founded in 1979 in Wolverhampton to combat racial prejudice in the art world. East of Acre Lane by Alex Wheatle (2001) As historian and writer Paul Gilroy writes in the introduction to Wheatle’s book: “This novel’s historical and geographical setting should be carefully specified. It can be defined by the immediate aftermath of the New Cross Massacre.” The thriller, which culminates in the Brixton riots, begins on 27 January 1981 and follows the life of Biscuit and his sticky relationship to the streets and crime. Wheatle explores the realities of what it meant to be young, poor and black in the 80s, subjected to bad housing, high unemployment and police cruelty. Vron Ware: The Black People’s Day of Action 02.03.1981 Vron Ware captured scenes from the Black People’s Day of Action that followed the fire, when 20,000 people, including Darcus Howe, Alex Pascal and Sybil Phoenix, took to Deptford’s streets, and made their way to Blackfriars Bridge and Fleet Street in order to protest at the failure of the Metropolitan police to properly investigate the tragedy. Captured in vivid detail, Ware’s photographs show the mood of protesters and their powerful signs. The photographs are now part of Autograph ABP’s permanent digital and print archive. Small Axe: Alex Wheatle Steve McQueen’s award-winning film series, Small Axe, is a brilliant depiction of London’s West Indian community between 1969 and 1982. It delves deep into their battles with police, judicial and education systems and also, their moments of euphoria. Alex Wheatle, about the life of the author of East of Acre Lane, follows his journey up to imprisonment for his involvement in the 1981 Brixton riots. The film remembers the New Cross fire with a gripping four-minute montage, featuring Johnson’s New Craas Massahkah and photographs of the aftermath of the fire, the funerals of victims and the Black People’s Day of Action. It’s an unforgettable scene that somehow commands both silence and applause."
"What is going on with Hilaria Baldwin supposedly being fake Spanish? Glad you asked – but there is a lot to cover. Starved of celebrity gossip and, well, all human interest all year, the internet has seized on the suggestion that Alec Baldwin’s wife has – at the very least – habitually over-stated her connection to Spain. I appreciate it doesn’t sound like much but, look, in 2020 we take what we can get.  I understand Hilaria is Alec Baldwin’s wife. But that’s about all I do understand. Where did all this start? A few days before Christmas, Hilaria gave her Instagram followers the gift of a Leibovitz-style photo of her wearing lacy black underwear and holding her bemused-looking baby. The rambling caption suggested that this was in promotion of a lavender ointment cream she claimed at least nominal role in developing. I’m as bemused as the baby. To quote the top-rated comment beneath Hilaria’s post: “What is your point?” We’re getting there. It started to become a saga when the comedian Amy Schumer shared the post on her own Instagram, cracking a joke in the caption that she looked equally glamorous with her own newborn. Schumer later deleted the post after it sparked widespread ribbing and Hilaria took offence. They’ve since made up. That’s a relief. What did Hilaria say? She posted a rambling four-and-a-half minute video in which she suggested that she had been the victim of body-shaming, writing in the caption: “Love a good joke – don’t think this should have been a big deal” – two points which no doubt all of us can get behind.  So far this doesn’t seem to be about, you know, the Spain bit. This is the thing. Bored and observant people on the internet noticed that the Spanish accent with which Hilaria had spoken in the past was mysteriously absent from her verbose video. She has a Spanish accent, because she is Spanish, I assume. Well, until recently, Hilaria’s speakers profile on the CAA website said she was “born in Mallorca, Spain and raised in Boston”. She has said her family lived in Mallorca, and she moved to the US at age 19 to go to university (and so knew “no pop culture”). She also identifies herself in her Instagram bio as “mama to five Baldwinitos” – Leonardo, Carmen Gabriela, Rafael, Romeo Alejandro and Eduardo Pau. But the video resurfaced historic speculation about Hilaria’s Spanish heritage, causing internet detectives to start working overtime – Christmas be damned. Material was unearthed of her American-seeming mother talking about her own childhood in Massachusetts; and the obituary of her paternal grandfather, describing family roots in Vermont that predate the American Revolution. Hilaria was also identified online as a 1992 graduate of the Cambridge School of Weston, suggesting she did not move to the US at 19. There, say people claiming to be her former classmates, she went by Hilary. “You have to admire Hilaria Baldwin’s commitment to her decade-long grift where she impersonates a Spanish person,” tweeted @lenirbriscoe, before sharing clips of Hilaria speaking of married life (“it feels really different”) with a marked Spanish accent and apparently forgetting, on a cooking show, the English word for cucumber. “This woman grew up in Massachusetts,” @lenibriscoe tweeted. Yes, as drama and intrigue go, it is low stakes – but many people seized on it as exactly what they needed at the end of a high-stakes year. So does Hilaria – or Hilary – really have no link to Spain at all? Hilaria’s parents live in Mallorca, and have done since 2011, according to Page Six. According to his online company profile, her father did study Spanish literature and visited the country frequently. Has Hilaria responded?  Oh yes. She addressed the question in another Instagram video – this one is seven-and-a-half minutes long. To summarise, Hilaria says the discrepancies in her biography can be explained by inaccurate reporting, which she has endeavoured to correct; and personal insecurities about her (justifiable) claim to Spain. Hilaria confirms she was born in Boston but as a “different kind of Bostonian”, having spent time in Spain while growing up (those frequent visits!) and speaking both languages. Most of her family lives there now and calls her Hilaria, making it habitual for her – though she will also answer to Hilary. As for her accent, Hilaria denies putting it on: it simply changes, she says, depending on how much Spanish she has been speaking in the recent past. “This is something that I’ve always been a little bit insecure about, but I’ve decided maybe 2021 we will get over that.” We can only hope. And by “definitely addressing it very openly right now”, Hilaria says, she is starting as she means to go on. The speculation troubles her because “my thing is about being authentic — and then if people say I’m not being authentic, it hurts my feelings”. She concludes where we started off: “I don’t really understand why it’s turning into such a big thing.” Shortly afterwards, Hilaria returned to Instagram to dispense further clarification, over six and half more minutes. “I love you,” her husband commented. Is that all Alec has had to say? Oh, no. He has posted his own video, captioned “Consider the source”. It is eight-and-a-half minutes of him railing against media companies, preceded by a frosty festive greeting. Amy Schumer must feel awful about all this. She posted a photo of herself looking wistful in a a large-brimmed sunhat and sunglasses, with the caption: “I get it. I went to Spain a couple times and loved it too.” Schumer concluded with a cucumber emoji – then later deleted the whole thing. ‘Deleted the whole thing’ – now she’s talking my language."
"For someone who professes to be “not a very Christmassy person”, comedian Sara Pascoe managed to enjoy our festive photoshoot. “It was fun,” she insists. “I smashed a bauble and everything.” Why isn’t she very Christmassy? “My parents are atheists and thought it was silly to lie to children, so we never thought Santa was real,” she laughs. “And my dad’s anti-Jesus. We never went for it as a family, so I don’t have that nostalgic relationship with this time of year. But I’m definitely a wintry person. Cold weather, cosy jumpers, walking the dog on a misty morning. And as a vegan, I’m a massive fan of roast potatoes and sprouts. Christmas is worth it just for the sprouts. They’re the main reason it’s not cancelled.” She might have been missing live standup but it’s still been a busy year for the 39-year-old Londoner. Pascoe’s second book, Sex Power Money, came out in paperback. Her sitcom, Out of Her Mind, debuted on BBC Two. Now comes a travel series, The Last Woman on Earth.  As a keen pub quizzer and panel game regular, who better to present our puzzles special and to compose some fiendish questions about the year’s TV for our Quiz Of the Year? Let the games begin. Why do you love a quiz so much?Even if I get all the answers wrong, it’s a fun way of learning. My husband [Australian comedian Steen Raskopoulos, who she married last year] and I went to the local pub and it was hosting an upside-down quiz. If you come second to last, you win all the money. Because we were the only ones there as a pair, we thought we were in with a chance. Then we came absolute last, which was humiliating. The quizmaster felt so sorry for us, he found a book of limericks as a consolation prize. Do you get overcompetitive?I do but it’s enthusiasm for joining in, rather than desperation to be the victor. I did Richard Osman’s House of Games a couple of years ago and was on against Rick Edwards, who’s also very competitive. They repeated that episode recently and I got a message saying: “I got my daughter to watch it because it’s so rare to see such a competitive, bossy woman in the public eye.” [Laughs]. I think it was a compliment. You wrote the foreword for The Feminist Quiz Book…Yes, I did that during lockdown. The book celebrates all these pioneering women forgotten by history. I interviewed Sandi Toksvig at the British Library recently and she’s so passionate about this stuff. Her 2021 Almanac is full of these incredible stories. She was telling me about Kathrine Switzer, the first woman to run the Boston Marathon, illegally, in the 60s. She registered under a gender-neutral name, wore a baggy tracksuit so everyone assumed she was a man and ran it. An official realised two miles into the race and tried to grab her but she finished. Five years later, they finally opened it to women. Do feminism and quizzes go together?Very much. Quizzes are best when you assume you know the answer but you’re wrong. Like on QI, when the buzzer goes off. That’s why podcasts No Such Thing As a Fish and You’re Wrong About are so great. Feminism and quizzes are a nice fit because sometimes we’ve learned stories the wrong way or overlooked a woman’s work. For example, Francis Crick and two male colleagues were awarded the Nobel prize for discovering DNA but Rosalind Franklin wasn’t. It’s important for these women to be recognised. How about board games?Trivial Pursuit is my absolute favourite. Word games, too: Scrabble, Boggle, Bananagrams. I love Settlers of Catan if you’ve got enough people. When I was a child, my sister Christina was in hospital a lot, so we’d play Guess Who? on her bed because it had the least amount of components to fly around and get lost. You can’t play Hungry Hungry Hippos in a hospital ward. Loads of Connect Four, too. Christina’s still unbeatable at it. She’s now a mum of two in her 30s but she can hustle you. It doesn’t matter who starts first, she’ll win. Have you watched The Queen’s Gambit and been inspired to play chess?Yep, within about 10 minutes of the first episode, I was like: “Right, I’m going to get really good at chess.” So many people are going to get chess sets for Christmas. What’s the premise of your new BBC travel series, The Last Woman on Earth?It’s me learning how to do the world’s most endangered jobs. Some professions are going to stop existing soon – whether it’s down to technology, climate change or other factors. I go to Cuba, which is opening up to the global market; Georgia, where traditions are being lost due to modernisation; and Finland, where so many industries are dependent on ice and snow. Are you a fan of celebrity travelogues?I like Anthony Bourdain’s because he’s so passionate about food. I don’t tend to watch other comedians’ ones. One of our directors had worked with Romesh Ranganathan and there was one time in Georgia when I didn’t want to do this traditional dance because it would be disrespectful. He said: “Romesh had to clean a horse’s penis, surely you can do one little dance?” I was like: “OK, I’ll do the little dance.” God bless Romesh for doing whatever he gets told but he’s set a dangerous precedent for the rest of us. “Look, Romesh won a Bafta, so just do it, OK?” Some of the jobs you try are quite dangerous. What was the most hair-raising experience?So many things sound fun during a production meeting in London but turn out to be horrific. I had to climb a giant tree in Cuba to collect coconuts. They told me it was all about core strength and I was like: “Cool, I do yoga, I can plank for 46 seconds, I’ll be straight up that tree.” But I couldn’t believe how hard it was. Meanwhile, this little old man who’d had two brandies with his lunch was whizzing up. It was scary in Georgia when there were armed Russian soldiers around. But the only time I feared I might die was when I fell off a horse and thought it might trample me. It didn’t. I was just covered in mud and a bit embarrassed for the rest of the day. Your sitcom Out of Her Mind aired in October. How do you feel it went down?Because it’s a bit boundary-pushing and non-traditional, we knew it might be divisive but I’ve had lovely responses. What was it like having Juliet Stevenson and Ade Edmondson play your parents?I always had Juliet in mind but people kept telling me I wouldn’t get her. It’s fine to have her on your moodboard but don’t be disappointed. But I hand-wrote her a letter saying “Will you be my mummy?” and she said yes! I met Adrian on [BBC show] I’ll Get This. We played this game where we had five clear shots in front of us. You had to down them, then your opponent guessed if it was vodka or water from your facial expressions. He drank all five like water and beat me, then he admitted he’d been filming War & Peace and had got really good at downing vodka. Anyway, I ended up adapting the father character for him and luckily he said yes as well. They were both brilliant. Amazing at their jobs but great fun to be around too. Jack Gleeson (AKA Joffrey from Game Of Thrones) appears as the ghost of your abortion. How did that come about?He’s friends with my husband from the comedy scene. We begged him and he did it as a favour. He was so perfect. His babyface was heartbreaking. I’ve never seen Game of Thrones but I hear he’s a villain, which I can’t imagine. I don’t see him that way at all. Is it annoying that female-led sitcoms tend to get seen as autobiographical?I understand why. We want to know if we’re being lied to. It happens to me with standup too – people really want to know which bits are true and which are fictional. But it’s not just women who get asked. Male novelists get it when it seems like they’re drawing from their own experience. Dolly Alderton sent me this quote the other day: “All of it’s true, none of it happened”, which sums it up perfectly. I was trying to deal with true emotional responses while not being entirely autobiographical. Do you ever get in trouble with friends, family or exes for telling their stories?I always check first. Because I’m a confessional comic, I’ve learned the hard way from upsetting people in the past. Nowadays there’s a lot of: “Hey, you haven’t heard from me in five years but I’ve got a book deal and…” How has your lockdown been?We got Covid in March, so we got it out of the way early. Since then we’ve been pretty much housebound, just pottering around. We’ve been growing herbs and cooking more meals. I’ve read piles of books and been learning to knit. The poor dog has never been so walked. I get his lead and he looks at me like: “Please, I’m tired, Let me sleep.” It’s what I imagine retirement feels like, apart from the queueing outside Sainsbury’s. My friend was telling me yesterday that everyone’s menstrual cycles have gone crazy. Apparently we’ve all got pandemic womb on top of everything else. Great! You turn 40 next May. Will you throw a party?I’m not really a party person but I’m looking forward to doing live standup again. That’s my proper job, my happy place and a gig will be my party. When we can all be in a room together again, that will be the sign that everyone’s OK and everything’s back to normal. The Last Woman on Earth With Sara Pascoe airs on BBC Two, Sunday 27 December at 9pm. All episodes of Out of Her Mind are on BBC iPlayer"
"The future of a museum that tells the astonishing story of the British “father of immunology” is hanging in the balance because it has been forced to close throughout the Covid crisis and faces uncertainty over how it will operate in the post-pandemic world. Edward Jenner’s former family home in Gloucestershire has been shut since February, and the decision has been taken to keep it closed until spring, meaning it will lose more than a year’s vital admission fees. Supporters of Dr Jenner’s House, which bills itself as the birthplace of vaccination, have pointed out the irony of it facing financial crisis in the year when its subject matter is so pertinent. Owen Gower, the museum’s manager, said Jenner’s work had taken on a new relevance in 2020. “But unfortunately we’ve had to close our doors for it,” he said. Born in 1749, Jenner spent much of his childhood exploring the countryside around his home. He was a polymath who studied medicine, horticulture and the natural world, achieving his fellowship of the Royal Society for a paper on the nesting habits of cuckoos. In 1796, he carried out the world’s first controlled vaccination against smallpox and established a free vaccination clinic in the Temple of Vaccinia, a summerhouse in the garden of Chantry House. The museum in the village of Berkeley tells the story of Jenner and the wider history of vaccination. Visitors are invited to view his study, the gardens and summerhouse and study the wider history of vaccination. Boris Johnson name-checked Jenner this week at his press conference on the day the first Covid vaccine was given approval for use in the UK, saying the techniques used by today’s scientists were “pioneered in this country by Edward Jenner”. But despite Jenner’s place in history, his former home – which opened as a museum 35 years ago – is not particularly well known. Only about 7,000 people a year visit, with most tourists to the region heading to the Cotswolds or the cities of Bath and Bristol rather than Berkeley. Until 2020, it had just about scraped through but faced a crisis when Covid meant it had to close completely to visitors. Gower said: “Seventy per cent of our income is visitor admissions. That disappeared overnight. That’s the core funding. We don’t have any regular government grants.” Reopening is proving difficult because its modest size makes social distancing difficult. Gower said: “It’s a small family home, that’s the charm of it, but it’s also the challenge of operating safely and sustainably in the age of Covid-19.” A crowd-funding effort was launched and helped raise enough money to secure the museum’s future until the spring, but the museum warns that it has not been saved from permanent closure. The Jenner Trust, the charity that runs the museum, has ambitious plans to reshape what it does, expanding its remit to inspire not only those who visit in person but reach out to people around the world through online events and conferences. It is seeking funding for this concept and also wants to build an endowment to allow the building to be looked after in perpetuity. Gower said: “We are trying to look to the future. We want what we have here to be accessible to the whole world, not just to people who come to Berkeley.”"
"It began with a fabulous 19th-century dress and a box of jumbled photographs cleared out of a Guildford attic before a move to the country. It has resulted in being able to tell the true, poignant story of Ranavalona III, the last queen of Madagascar. Ranavalona’s remarkable life of can be revealed thanks to the auction this week of personal effects unearthed by a descendent of Clara Herbert, who worked for the Madagascan royal family from the 1890s to the 1920s. Herbert was the paid companion to a queen whose adventures were the stuff of fiction. Widowed at 22, she was made to marry an elderly prime minister, dethroned after a French invasion and exiled to Algiers, never to return. The auctioneer Kerry Taylor has pieced together Ranavalona’s story from the box of photographs, postcards, souvenirs, receipts and diaries that she is selling on Tuesday. “It has been the most fascinating detective work,” she said. “The queen I think was a very brave woman. She was very strong in adversity … she had to make the best of what life dealt her.” Ranavalona’s husband was poisoned when she was about to accede to the throne. The finger has been pointed at the prime minister, a much older man who had been married to two previous queens and wanted Ranavalona as his bride. “This poor girl had to marry this horrible old man,” said Taylor. “She was told she just needed to do needlework and look nice.” Bigger trouble was on the horizon. Soon into her reign, in 1895, France invaded and annexed the island. Ranavalona was initially allowed to stay as a puppet queen, but the French authorities accused her influential aunt Ramisindrazana of inciting Malagasy rebels. Ranavalona, her aunt and other members of the royal family were packed off to the island of Réunion, where photographs in the archive show how miserable they were. “They all look so upset, thin and drawn,” said Taylor. “You have Ranavalona and her aunt and her nephew in a bowler hat outside this weird-looking palace that they had built for them, it is like a villa in wood.” The cast of characters in the photographs includes the 14-year-old princess Razafinandriamanitra, heavily pregnant with the child of a French soldier. Soon the royal family was put onboard a boat for France. They dreamed of Paris, but when they docked in Marseille it became clear that was not the plan. On being told they were going to Algiers, Ranavalona burst into tears and declared: “Who is certain of tomorrow? Only yesterday I was a queen. Today I am simply an unhappy, broken-hearted woman.” Algiers turned out not to be so bad. It had a lively social scene and the queen became something of a local celebrity. The archive includes musical programmes dedicated to her and a biscuit wrapper with her portrait. There are photographs showing how happy she looks. The contrast from earlier images is remarkable, said Taylor. “You have to pinch yourself, you say that can’t be her, it looks like a different person. She has put on weight, she looks healthy and beautiful … She seriously looks a different woman altogether.” In 1901, she finally got to go to France, where she spent a fortune on dresses and was followed everywhere she went, said Taylor. “People are fascinated … She’s beautiful, she’s dressed in the best French fashions and she’s a queen. What’s not to like?” After Ranavalona’s death in 1917, her aunt was given permission to move to the south of France, accompanied by the ever-loyal Herbert. Ramisindrazana died in about 1923 and it is her elaborate dark purple velvet and cyclamen pink satin court dress, probably made in Madagascar, which ended up in the Guildford attic, along with the box of mementos. Herbert briefly sought work in Nice before returning to the UK, where she lived in Reading. Her thirst for travel soon returned and she went to China as a Methodist missionary. Taylor said it was incredibly rare to find high fashion from the 19th century worn by black women, “and even more rare to find such a wealth of documents, photographs and ephemera to augment our understanding of them”. Taylor has an estimate of £1,000-1,500 on the archive, but she admits the figure is a stab in the dark. “How do you value it? Where do you start?” she said."
"Cate Blanchett-led refugee drama Stateless and Shannon Murphy’s coming-of-age film Babyteeth have blitzed the 2020 Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (Aacta) awards, sharing 22 wins between them at an unusual ceremony capping off an unusual year. A seemingly smaller than usual selection of films and TV shows graced the nomination lists this year, with the industry mainly celebrating productions that were completed before Covid-19 restrictions hit. Russell Crowe, newly inaugurated president of the academy, addressed the socially distanced ceremony at The Star casino in Sydney on Monday afternoon remotely – from a locale he referred to only as “the bush” – saying he hoped to see more federal support for film and television in post-Covid Australia. “Twelve months ago this area around here was scorched and burnt,” he said. “I imagine there’s a lot of you feeling the same way for what has been a very challenging year for the arts. Just as these paddocks and trees have new growth, the same thing will happen with our screen industry.” He noted the Australian government’s handling of the pandemic and the fact that low case numbers meant screen production had restarted here. “I want to encourage the federal government to use this time to set a platform so this rise in production can be facilitated to continue,” Crowe said. “Given the right support, the screen industry can be used as a powerful driver for economic recovery.” This year, the main ceremony was split into two events: film, followed by TV. The TV categories were dominated by the ABC drama Stateless, which Blanchett co-created, co-executive produced and co-starred in. The series, directed by Emma Freeman and Jocelyn Moorhouse, follows four people as they interact with Australia’s notoriously harsh immigration detention system, and is reportedly based on true stories. Guardian reviewer Luke Buckmaster called it a “gripping” drama with a “curious mixture of nail-biting verisimilitude and psychologically charged aesthetic”. The cast of Stateless, including Fayssal Bazzi, Yvonne Strahovski, Darren Gilshenan, and Blanchett won all of the acting awards for TV drama. The show was announced best telefeature or miniseries, and also swept up statuettes for best screenplay (Elise McCredie) and best direction. It bested other multiple nominees Bloom and Mystery Road; the latter of which, however, did win best drama series. Meanwhile, the film categories were dominated by Babyteeth, which Observer reviewer Wendy Ide called “possibly the most joyous, life-affirming film ever to be made about terminal disease.” Babyteeth – Shannon Murphy’s directorial debut – won for best film, best screenplay (Rita Kalnejais) and best direction, and also cleaned up in the acting categories, with Eliza Scanlen winning best lead actress for her turn as cancer-diagnosed teen Milla, Toby Wallace best lead actor, Ben Mendelsohn best supporting actor and Essie Davis taking home best supporting actress in a film. Mendelsohn accepted his award from Sicily, appearing in a prerecorded video in a bathrobe at 4am after a late night shoot. “I love Babyteeth,” he said. “Of the films of mine that I’ve seen, it’s my favourite.” Babyteeth also received awards for best casting and best original score, bringing its total awards to nine, from 12 nominations. In slightly lighter fare, Tim Minchin’s comedy TV series Upright won best in that category, while Minchin himself won best comedy performer. Shaun Micallef’s Mad As Hell won in the marginally different category of best comedy entertainment program. The wildly popular Emmy-award-winning cartoon Bluey was awarded best children’s program. The Aactas are traditionally presented across two dates, the first being the industry luncheon – this year replaced by an online event last week – which honour the less high profile craft practitioners, such as those in cinematography, costume and make-up, editing, score and sound. Stateless also dominated the craft awards, with its first episode, The Circumstances in Which They Come, yielding five of the six awards the show picked up last week. The others were for best cinematography, costume design, editing, production design, and sound in the television categories. Episode six of the series also won the award for best original score. The True History of the Kelly Gang, which had seemed a strong contender in the film categories and was nominated for 10 awards, picked up three in craft: best costume design, hair and make-up, and production design. The Invisible Man, starring US actor Elisabeth Moss, also picked up three craft awards, for cinematography, editing and sound. Indigenous legal academic, writer and filmmaker Larissa Behrendt won the award for best direction in nonfiction television for her work on Maralinga Tjarutja, a documentary about the nuclear testing on Indigenous country in the 1950s and 60s and the consequences for the local people. Also honoured was Jennifer Kent, who was announced as the recipient of the Byron Kennedy award for low-budget genre filmmaking and creative resilience over the past decade for her international success with the 2014 film, The Babadook. See the Aactas website for a full list of winners and nominees. Highlights from Monday’s ceremony will be broadcast on Channel Seven on Wednesday at 8.30pm."
"After months of confinement and inactivity, you might think you know the sound of absolutely nothing happening. But Radio Lento is determined to prove you wrong. The weekly podcast, which is becoming something of a lockdown hit, plays unedited recordings of rural environments across the UK – with no talking, no music and no other enhancements. It’s just the wind, the water and the cries of animals. Tides turn, owls call softly and the sound of far-off church bells carries over the fields. “It’s for people who want to put the outside on their ears,” says co-founder Hugh Huddy. “It’s like photographs – but sound photographs.” Listening to such rich soundscapes instils a sense of peace, says Huddy, who calls the result “visceral relaxation – your body letting go but your brain switching on”. Lento has now clocked up more than 14,000 downloads since it launched in March, an astonishing result for a kitchen-table podcast created by first-timers. Artists have been recording nature for decades. Whalesong was huge in the 1970s. More recently, Jana Winderen and Chris Watson have used field recordings in their compositions, to haunting effect. But these sound artists tend to treat the audio as material for highly crafted creations. Radio Lento takes a different path, giving us the raw sound as a way to express the spirit of a place. “What we’re trying to do,” says Huddy, “is find places that have a beauty about them, that are empty of people – and capture their essence.” Huddy has been capturing nature since 2004, initially making short field recordings, then experimenting with hiding microphones in trees. Along with his partner, Madeleine Sugden, they honed their technique on epic family walks. As the spring lockdown began to bite, they listened back through their archive recordings and found them unexpectedly fulfilling, which gave them the idea for Radio Lento. “We were struck with cabin fever,” says Huddy. “Listening to the recordings blocked out distracting noise – loud music, the neighbour’s angle grinder. The soundscapes suddenly had a value they hadn’t had before. It’s slow radio, but not like the BBC’s slow radio, where they cherrypick moments when something happens. That’s guided listening. We make ourselves transparent.” Lento’s artistry lies in selecting the right section from hours of recording, not just the highlights. One 40-minute episode is called Tawny Echoes in the Cathedral of Trees, while Night Beside a Stream in Wales lasts a full hour. “We’re not interested in getting ‘the perfect owl’,” says Sugden. “To really appreciate an owl, or a stream, you need time, within the context of everything else that’s going on. The concept of time is what we want to preserve.” Before long, Huddy and Sugden were leaving microphones out overnight to capture the most peaceful hours, staying in a youth hostel nearby with the kids. Unlike the cutting-edge recordings made by professionals such as Watson, Radio Lento is a family affair. With two lively – “very lively” – children and no car, the family must travel by train from London to find their quiet places, lugging a flask of tea, copious biscuits and warm clothes, as well as the audio kit. Sugden and Huddy reckon they’ve walked more than 150 miles since the podcast began. To camouflage the microphones and protect them from the elements, they designed their own rig and built it on their kitchen table. “That’s taken a lot of trial and error.” And to work out where to site the mics, they simply stand in a promising spot and rotate their heads like a radar antenna. It’s surprisingly successful. That said, there have been some disasters. Nature itself doesn’t always cooperate. “Once, some wasps found the rig,” says Huddy. “They were chewing on the wood to get it for their nests. You would never normally hear that sound – it’s so subtle. They did it for two hours. Their little jaws scratching, scratching. It makes your skin crawl.” The recording had to be ditched. On one beach recording in Essex, an audibly strong gust of wind is followed by the metallic thunk of the mic toppling over on the shingle. Running footsteps are heard and then there’s a scraping noise as the rig is righted. You can almost hear a sigh of relief. “If the tide had been two inches further in,” says Huddy, “we’d have lost the whole lot.” Moments like this remind listeners that people are a part of the landscape, too. Radio Lento doesn’t attempt to capture “pure nature”, unspoiled by human contact, if there’s any such thing. It is not unknown for a distant jet to make a faint appearance, or for far-off road noise to be heard as a hedgehog snuffles through the undergrowth. In future, Sugden and Huddy hope to expand the therapeutic uses for Radio Lento. “There was a geography teacher who was playing it to her classes,” says Sugden. “She said they had the calmest lesson they’d had for ages.” People with tinnitus and insomnia also sing its praises. Even pets are fans: one listener’s dog took refuge from fireworks in a Lento podcast, while another’s cat appreciated the birdsong. Best of all, subscribers are starting to send in their own field recordings. “We’re getting people to listen, to sit and take stock, and think, ‘That sounds nice’,” Sugden says. In a world of angle grinders and next door’s techno, listening to wind rustling in the trees for a few hours may be exactly what we need."
"I know it is tedious to look back on 2020 and force everything through the prism of coronavirus – “Hey, remember that absolute horrorshow of a year we all just-about lived through? Well, let’s look back on the horror again, shall we?” – but it is slightly unavoidable when recapping what is arguably the weirdest year in television since the format was invented. We have, each of us, watched more TV in the last nine months than at any other time in our lives. And yet, with so little of it being newly produced, there has been an odd staleness to our viewing habits. I’m bored of live TV and I’m bored of box sets, so what else is there to do? Read a book? Behave. The first thing we need to confront is the short-lived Zoom era of Lockdown 1.0, which wasn’t very good. It’s harsh of me to single people out, but The Steph Show on Channel 4 was an early example of form clattering up against need, as a cheery Steph McGovern tried to hold together a light magazine show from the comfort of her own home. Yes, it was rubbish (and the less-constrained Steph’s Packed Lunch studio variation shows that the desperately-broadcasting-from-a-house was the faulty part, not the rest of the show’s format), but crucially it started airing on 30 March – the date we still thought we’d all be back at work within a couple of weeks – and the sheer fact that someone tried to launch a magazine show to keep us all entertained in the middle of a history-shaping global emergency is something to be commended. Then we started to cope. This was officially The Year TV Presenters Started Standing Really Far Apart, and that will probably continue deep into 2021. Some formats have coped pretty well with social distancing, because they were basically socially distanced anyway – Sunday Brunch has done just fine, proving Tim Lovejoy is a sort of TV cockroach that even nukes cannot finish off – and, once it restarted, Sky’s bombastic blokes-shouting-opinions-at-each-other-while-absolutely-not-touching-at-all football coverage remained largely the same. It is possible our standards dropped a little – The Queen’s Gambit and The Undoing were both feted simply because they were new TV, rather than good TV – but then I suppose one of the major symptoms of coronavirus is a loss of taste. It should be said, though, that I May Destroy You, Normal People and Industry more than made up for, say, Netflix’s The Stranger. Part of me is hopeful for the next couple of years of TV – if nothing else, writers have had nine months to develop stellar ideas, and those scripts that didn’t go into production before the pandemic have had almost a full year of polish – but I don’t want to diminish the here and now. TV has been there for us, and for that reason, one of my shows of the year was The Great British Bake Off – normally something I dismiss as twee nonsense for people who only go to Glastonbury to drink gin – but this year elevated to essentially a public health service, with cast and crew bubbling together to make a cosy competition show that felt like a tranquil island of normality. So that’s 2020, then: not the best year for innovation, nor for the premium quality drama we’ve grown accustomed to in the golden age of TV, but it’s kept going, and that’s something to be thankful for, at least."
"As president of the United States – at least, for 49 more days – Donald Trump retains the power to pardon anyone of a federal crime in “one of the weirdest quirks of being an American president”, said Trevor Noah, “sort of like a cheat code for America’s criminal justice system. “And it looks like President Trump is going to spend the next two months mashing those buttons,” the Daily Show host continued, as Trump has reportedly considered issuing pre-emptive pardons for his three eldest children, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, none of whom have been charged with a crime. “Aw, guys, that is adorable. Trump is pardoning his kids and his house pets,” Noah joked, referring to Giuliani. “And he’s not even pardoning them for anything specific. Trump is just handing out pardons like they’re gift cards.” In another layer to a scandal sandwich, the Department of Justice revealed an investigation into a bribery scheme for presidential pardons. Basically, Noah explained, “Trump managed to shove one of his scandals in the middle of another scandal. So impressive.” Unsealed documents from the investigation reveal someone, name redacted, contributed a large sum of money to the Trump campaign in exchange for a presidential pardon; it is not clear if Trump pardoned the person in question, considered a pardon, or even if he knew about the contribution. “We don’t know what Trump did,” said Noah, but “after knowing Trump for this long, I think we can assume that my man is not gonna turn down some pardon cash. If anything, I think we should be impressed that he hasn’t started targeting Instagram ads to former felons.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert replayed an emotional, bracing speech from Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who oversaw the implementation of a new voting system in Georgia, in which he decried the president’s refusal to rein in his supporters and pleaded with Trump to “stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence”. The speech went viral, and Sterling “was praised for his courage, his clarity and his call to civility”, said Colbert. “The president heard that … and popped open a can of ‘suck it’.” On Wednesday afternoon, Trump posted a conspiracy theory-filled rant on Facebook – “no press, no questions, not even the mediating lower third graphics of cable news”, Colbert explained. “Just uncut blue-flake crazy packed into a straw and blown right into the brain stem of the kamikaze Maga dead-enders.” Colbert described the video as “just another rambling mass of lies that lasted a full 46 minutes” that should’ve been released on Thanksgiving, “not because he said anything worth hearing, but at least the people who canceled a big family Thanksgiving could’ve pretended they were still eating with their racist uncle.” At one point in his rant, Trump demonstrated a “surprising amount of self-awareness”, in revealing “even knew how poorly his stupidity would be received” – “Even what I’m saying now will be demeaned and disparaged, but that’s OK,” said the president. “Well, as long as it’s OK, you’re a petty, angry man desperate for validation you will never receive and have never deserved,” Colbert snapped. “And in 50 days, you’ll be out of the White House without the protections of executive power, and no court is going to uphold you pardoning yourself.” As of Tuesday, all contested states had certified their election results, cementing Biden’s victory. “And yet, still, still Republicans are terrified to speak that basic truth,” Colbert said, pointing to Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson, who admitted in a phone call with a reporter that he knew Biden had won but saying so publicly would be “political suicide”. “Really? I would say the real political suicide is refusing to distance yourself from a president who has lost and is willing to destroy democracy and your party out of spite,” Colbert responded. “It’s like the GOP is saying, ‘hey, let’s play hands on a hard body on this running pickup inside this closed garage – do not open the door to let oxygen in. That would be political suicide and it would hurt the truck’s feelings.’” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped a less-than-safe Christmas gathering at the White House, where numerous guests attended the indoor event without masks. Trump “told revelers it’s been an amazing four years”, Kimmel reported, “which is a sentiment shared only by white supremacists and the guys who make money impersonating him on Cameo”. “All anyone at the White House wants for Christmas this year is a pardon,” Kimmel added, gesturing to reports that the president was considering pre-emptive pardons for his children “for whatever crimes they may or may not have committed”. “Usually, presidents grant pardons after they’ve been vetted very carefully by the justice department,” Kimmel explained. “Trump is shooting them out of a T-shirt cannon right now.”"
"Another post-election day, another round of Donald Trump’s “bar fight with reality”, according to Trevor Noah, although that may be coming to an end with a death knell dismissal from the supreme court of a Republican-backed lawsuit to overturn the election in Pennsylvania. It took just 34 minutes from the brief’s filing for the court to issue a one-sentence rebuke: “the application for injunctive relief presented to justice Alito and by him referred to the court is denied”. There was no recorded dissent from any of the nine justices, including Trump’s three appointees. In other words, “Trump is taking L’s, people,” said the Daily Show host. “Not only did they shut this case down, but they shut it down in just 34 minutes. They didn’t even pretend that they were going to consider it! This is like asking somebody out and they just shut you down immediately. “You can’t blame the supreme court for not wanting to get involved in Trump’s case,” Noah added, “because we all have that one friend that when you see them crying, you think, ‘You know, I’m just gonna keep walking. Because if I try to help, it’s gonna become a whole thing …’” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee celebrated Trump’s final days in office, although “unfortunately, along with stealing all the copper wiring in the White House, Trump may spend his last days doing what he does best: making sure nobody in his life ever faces consequences”. The president has reportedly discussed pre-emptive pardons for some of his closest allies, including his three oldest children and son-in-law Jared Kushner, or perhaps even himself. “Presidential clemency is supposed to correct injustice,” Bee explained, “which, to be fair, some presidents have actually done.” Barack Obama commuted the sentences of hundreds of non-violent drug offenders, Jimmy Carter pre-emptively pardoned Vietnam draft dodgers, and George HW Bush “pre-emptively pardoned his digestive system before vomiting all over the Japanese prime minister.” “Presidents can use pardons for good, but abusing them doesn’t just protect bad people now, it also influences bad people later,” she added. Ford’s pardon of Nixon, for example, was ostensibly to heal the nation after the bruising Watergate scandal, “but if Nixon had faced real consequences, it could’ve made subsequent administrations think twice before abusing their power. That’s why whether or not Trump pardons himself, states still need to investigate him and his allies. “It’s not about vengeance, it’s about restoring our faith in institutions and strengthening the guardrails that have barely held over the last four years,” Bee concluded. “Because if we fail to learn from Trump’s attempts to defeat democracy, we’ll have no one but ourselves to blame when the next Republican administration comes along to finish the job he started.” “January 20 cannot come fast enough,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show, as he looked forward to the date when “America will usher in a glorious new era of basic competence” with newly announced, experience-based cabinet appointments. Biden announced this week that Dr Vivek Murthy will serve as his surgeon general and replace “the old surgeon general, a tongue depressor with googly eyes,” Colbert joked. Meanwhile, “despite Biden’s appointments, our current president continues to deny reality”, Colbert continued, as he reportedly considers mass pardons for staff, even those not accused of any crime. It’s “not really the behavior you expect to see from someone who’s going to be around for another four years”, Colbert explained. “If your 90-year-old grandpa starts taking a trip to Italy, skydives and has a threesome, he’s not crossing items off his ‘live forever’ list.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers blasted the president’s bungling of a deal with Pfizer for additional coronavirus vaccines. Because Trump passed on the deal months ago, Pfizer might not have more doses for the US until next June, while America faces potential vaccine shortages amid global competition. “I knew Trump was a shit businessman, but I didn’t realize he was this bad,” Meyers said. “I’m starting to think if you gave him a time machine, he’d go back to the year 2000 and buy stock in apples and Enron. “Trump championed the vaccine as the one thing he was doing to combat the virus,” Meyers added, “and even that he fucked up. It’s like if the Flash showed up to the Justice League with a pulled hamstring.” Meyers also recapped a peak Trump-era moment in which Fox News interrupted his campaign-style event for Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s vaccine initiative, to inform viewers of the supreme court’s dismissal of the Trump campaign’s Hail Mary lawsuit to overturn the election in Pennsylvania. “I’m not sure there’s a single moment that captures this farce better,” said Meyers. “It’s like if halfway through Sesame Street, Big Bird interrupted a song about the alphabet, looked straight into the camera and said: ‘Breaking news, kid. No one likes you, and you’re never going to learn how to spell.”"
"Survivors, families of victims and the local mayor have expressed deep misgivings about the production of a new film that will depict the days leading up to the Port Arthur massacre, which claimed 35 lives in 1996.  On Monday, streaming service Stan announced the film NITRAM, which has already commenced production in Geelong, Victoria. It is being helmed by Snowtown director Justin Kurzel, and stars Judy Davis, Anthony LaPaglia, Essie Davis and American actor Caleb Landry Jones as the gunman, whose first name is spelled backwards in the title. But while little is known about the film at this stage, many have expressed their dismay at its potential to glamorise the killer, reignite conspiracy theories and retraumatise survivors of what, at the time, was the largest single shooter killing ever. Hobart writer Justin Woolley was 12 years old when he witnessed the shootings from 100 metres away. On Twitter on Tuesday he said “the largest peace-time massacre by a single shooter in history” needed to be remembered and commemorated. “But turning it into a piece of money-making entertainment? You’ll have to excuse me, and I would have though any right-minded person, for believing that is tasteless.” Woolley said he wasn’t calling for the film to be censored. “I will be steering clear of it for obvious reasons, but I’m not advocating it be stopped,” he wrote. “They are free to make this movie, sure, but that also means I’m allowed to say I think it’s a horrible idea.” Stan has undertaken to respond to the Guardian’s questions about whether any affected parties were consulted prior to the film going into production, and to concerns voiced by survivors and people in the Port Arthur community. Stan was unable to respond before publication of this story. The film is being shot in regional Victoria instead of Tasmania, a decision that the Guardian understands was made out of respect for the residents in and near Port Arthur. The producers have also made it clear the film will not portray the actual massacre; only the events leading up to it and what may have been going on inside the head of the gunman. But for Woolley this does not pass muster. “As an author I know well that in order to create a story about this individual it is necessary to generate sympathy in the audience, at least have them relate to the subject. It is this, in a film portraying the life of Martin Bryant, that I strongly object to,” he wrote on Twitter. “We do not need a study of the motivations of the perpetrator of this crime. We know them already.” While little is known about the film at this stage, a spokesperson for the Alannah and Madeline Foundation, a children’s charity established by Walter Mikac after he lost his two young daughters and wife in the shooting, said the foundation was firmly against any film that could cause distress to those affected. “The foundation is consistent in its views that out of respect for the survivors, it is not appropriate to give any platform to the perpetrator,” the spokesperson said, telling Guardian Australia that Mikac did not wish to discuss the project personally. “Films like this do nothing to help the understanding of such grotesque, violent and inhumane acts,” she said. “We don’t want to suppress creativity and art … we understand it’s a really difficult balancing act. But we’re not interested in giving the perpetrator a moment in the sun.” The film was commissioned by the Melbourne international film festival, where it will premiere in 2021. On Tuesday, Screen Australia posted a tweet saying it had not funded NITRAM. The Police Association of Tasmania, whose members were among the first on the scene of the 28 April 1996 shootings, also indicated their wariness over the potential impact of the film. “A commercial movie about the Port Arthur mass murderer has the potential to severely affect the mental health of many, many Tasmanians, including current and past members of the Police Association of Tasmania,” the association’s president, Colin Riley, told the Guardian in a statement. Kelly Spaulding, the mayor of Port Arthur municipality Tasman Council, said news of the film going into production could have already retraumatised some of those close to the tragedy. “The community is pretty upset down here,” he said. “Every time the media brings this up it brings back a lot of feelings which are obviously still quite raw, and it affects families not just down here but those living across Australia and overseas as well.” Spaulding said Monday’s announcement “came like a bolt out of the blue”. “It’s a bit disappointing nobody [the producers] thought to give us a heads up,” he said. “Obviously there’s nothing we can do to stop them ... I just hope people don’t mention [the gunman’s] name.” The Alannah and Madeline Foundation said the producers had contacted them early on, but prior to Monday’s announcement they “weren’t aware of any logistical details or project development”. The foundation is regularly contacted by researchers and creatives seeking to retell the story, they said, but “we politely decline as our focus is on the prevention of violence to children … we do not seek to glorify or publicise this crime”. Apart from retraumatising survivors, the foundation’s main concern was the influence it might have on other deeply disturbed individuals. “What we have seen in the past is that every time we put a spotlight on someone who has [committed a violent crime], the idea of instant celebrity attracts others,” the spokesperson said. The film has divided people on Twitter: while many have rejected its premise, others have highlighted how little we know about it. “The discourse already is so perplexing,” tweeted film critic Glenn Dunks. “While I understand the desire to not put victims through the trauma of a reenactment film (is that what it will be? we don’t quite know), we have likely all watched stuff on 9/11 or Columbine. What makes Australian crime so off limits to artists?” Composer John Haddock was among a group of six Opera Australia artists who sat next to the gunman at the Broad Arrow cafe that day. He later hid with many others in a stable at the far end of the complex, as the shots repeatedly rang out across the eerie landscape. “My first reaction [to the film] was ‘this a tricky one’,” Haddock told the Guardian. “Is this appropriate? It brings back terrible memories, even now as I talk about it. But this is fine with me because I read that the film won’t be reliving the massacre. If that was the case I could not bear it.” Haddock said the trauma had lessened over the years, to the point that the events of that Sunday afternoon are now just a bad memory. But he is concerned that fresh attention will stir up the conspiracy theorists and people like Pauline Hanson, who in March last year implied in comments recorded secretly by al-Jazeera that the 1996 massacre was a government conspiracy. “It makes me angry, having lived through it,” he said."
"The Adelaide festival has launched its 2021 program after a nightmare year that has seen more than 200 international artists scratched from its form sheet – and the program announcement itself pushed back after South Australia went into immediate lockdown a day before it was due. Staging the international arts event in unprecedented times, organisers are still coming to terms with a massive hit to revenue from the 50% capacity rule in venues and an overhaul of insurance cover that will ensure festivalgoers and the artists themselves will not be out of pocket if another pandemic-led shutdown is called early next year. Only a handful of international headline artists will make it to South Australia, arriving early to quarantine before rehearsals in January and February, ahead of the festival opening on 26 February. But a number of international acts will now be livestreaming their performances into Her Majesty’s Theatre from their home bases in Europe and the US, on a scale believed to be most ambitious yet embarked on by an international festival. “At this point now we’re quite Zen,” Rachel Healy, co-artistic director with Neil Armfield, told Guardian Australia in the days leading up to the postponed launch. “One thing you can guarantee is that the situation will remain entirely dynamic until a vaccine is distributed globally. “So even though it was incredibly disappointing to have to postpone our launch, by now we are all very experienced at rolling with the punches.” Bearing in mind the unenviable predicament of Adelaide’s equivalent in Scotland (the Edinburgh international festival had to cancel the entire event in August), Healy said planning was in place to cover the worst possible scenario. Yet-to-be determined, however, is how game Australian audiences will be to pay for tickets, in uncertain times, for events that aren’t scheduled until the end of February. “I think everyone in the arts has tried to ensure that anxiety in ticket buyers doesn’t become a barrier to purchasing a ticket, that people don’t start thinking if the state closes down or there’s an event cancellation then I’ve done my dough,” Healy said. “If the borders do close again or if you’re sick and you can’t come, there will be an immediate refund.” The festival was not prepared to go into the details of the additional insurance hoops it had to leap through to deliver on that promise if called upon. But it is watching closely Live Performance Australia’s concerted lobbying of the federal government to establish a temporary interruption fund for the arts, not unlike the $49.5m fund already in place to get the film industry back on its feet. A handful of international artists will arrive well in advance of the festival to comply with the 14-day quarantine rule. American countertenor Aryeh Nussbaum Cohen, who will sing the role of Oberon in Benjamin Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, will arrive mid-January. The choreographer for the festival’s opera centrepiece, Denni Sayers, will arrive early February, as will New York artist Robin Frohardt and her team to install her Plastic Bag Store, fresh from its run in New York’s Times Square. When the first lockdown was announced, Healy said the festival believed it would be able to create a bubble of sorts. “We knew the [overseas artists] wouldn’t be able to go into the community, they wouldn’t be able to attend sponsorship functions and the things that festival artists normally participate in, but we believed that we would be able to create this bubble where they could be taken from airport to hotel, hotel to theatre and back again, so they could at least perform for Adelaide audiences,” she said. “But the second wave in Victoria didn’t just affect Victorians. It meant that the entire country had to recalibrate, and we knew this sort of model was not going to fly.” It was then that Armfield and Healy realised their original program would be impossible to deliver. They estimate more than 200 artists, including authors from the writers’ festival and Womadelaide acts, had to be cancelled. One of the largest annual events in the country’s music calendar and a staple of the festival for the past 28 years, Womadelaide has been pared back from a four-day extravaganza spread across seven stages in Adelaide’s Botanic Park to just four concerts on a single stage in the city’s CBD Park Lands. Salvaged from the wreckage was four major performances that will now be part of one of the world’s most ambitious livestreaming projects to date. Australian director Simon Stone’s production of Euripides’ tragedy Medea, created for Ivo van Hove’s International Theatre Amsterdam, will be relayed to a live audience in Adelaide’s Her Majesty’s Theatre. The audience reaction will be livestreamed back to the performers. Young South London choreographer Botis Seva’s Olivier award-winning BLKDOG will be seen by Australian audiences in the same mode, as will a concert by Russian-German pianist Igor Levit, and the Vakhtangov State Theatre production of Alexander Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin, which will be streamed live from Moscow. “It’s a grand experiment, we’re not pretending it’s anything other than that,” Healy told Guardian Australia. “But companies around the world are saying that we don’t know anyone else who’s doing this and we’re so excited to participate because maybe it’s something that we can all learn from and take into the future.” This is one year the festival will not have to weather time-worn criticism over its overemphasis on international artists – a criticism that has always been unjustified, says Healy. “Those who criticise the Adelaide festival for not being completely Australian forget that we are not on the eastern seaboard, and we don’t have a massive parade of international artists coming through our state on a regular basis in a way that Sydney and Melbourne do. “This is the only opportunity [South Australians] have – that’s 17 days a year – where they will see great international artists, without having to fly anywhere to see those artists. For 365 days a year there are local artists and Australian artists in Adelaide.” Many of those artists are in town at the same time as Adelaide festival, performing at Adelaide fringe."
"Melbourne Museum will become permanent home to the world’s most complete triceratops skeleton, with the “immense and unprecedented” $3m acquisition of a 67m-year-old dinosaur fossil. After two years of negotiation and due diligence, the Victorian government and Museums Victoria have brokered a deal to bring the triceratops horridus – which was discovered on private land in the United States in 2014 – to Melbourne next year where it will go on display for the first time. “It’s immense, and frankly, unprecedented in terms of this sort of item of such global iconic stature and quality being in an Australian museum. There’s no precedent really,” Dr Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of palaeontology at Melbourne Museum, told Guardian Australia on Wednesday. The skeleton is at least 87% complete, measures up to seven metres long from tip to tail, stands at more than 2m tall, and literally weighs a tonne. Its 261kg skull is also 99% intact. It’s so finely preserved that even skin impressions and tendons are visible. “Triceratops skeletons that are almost completely intact are rarely found – in fact, are vanishingly rare for triceratops, despite its popularity, and iconic status,” Fitzgerald said. “T-rex now is almost a dime a dozen – a garden-variety dinosaur. It’s basic, a vanilla dinosaur … But there’s really just a handful, maybe four or five substantially complete triceratops skeletons on the entire planet.” The fossil was discovered on private property in eastern Montana by independent commercial fossil prospector Craig Pfister. Museums Victoria became aware of the fossil in 2018 and began investigations into its provenance and authenticity. A spokesperson from the organisation said they could not share details about the landowner in order to preserve the integrity of the excavation site. Fossil ownership and trade laws are complicated and vary between countries, but in the US, fossils found on private property belong to the landowner and can be sold commercially. Independent prospectors need permission from landowners to dig on private land, but will often negotiate deals with landowners that allow them to share in the profits of sale for any significant find. Trade in fossils can also be extremely lucrative: a near-complete tyrannosaurus rex skeleton sold for US$31.8m in October. Museums Victoria is a member of the International Council of Museums that requires the organisation to adhere to a code of ethics around the purchase of fossils. “Acquisitions by Museums Victoria have to go through an extremely rigorous due process, due diligence around provenance, and that includes a fully detailed investigation of the origins of any item that is under consideration,” said Fitzgerald. “That was quite an involved process, which is why it actually took some time just to get this point of announcing that we have acquired this fossil.” This particular fossil was discovered in an area known as Hell Creek, a place Fitzgerald said “for a long time has been known as one of the globally richest sources of dinosaur fossils, and indeed, fossils of plants and other animals that lived in the environment with dinosaurs”. Hell Creek was also where the famous “Duelling Dinosaurs” – a tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops locked in permanent battle – were discovered in 2006. Museums Victoria’s triceratops dates from the end of the cretaceous period, “almost a blink of an eye before the cataclysmic events 66 million years ago that followed the asteroid striking the Earth and leading to a global mass extinction,” said Fitzgerald. “The final moments before we transitioned into the era of life that we live in, the Cenozoic era.”Fitzgerald, whose own research in palaeontology focuses on the fossils of ancient marine animals, said a fascination with dinosaurs is universal in his field. “Anyone who is fortunate enough to become a palaeontologist is amazed and in awe of dinosaurs,” he said. The triceratops is at the final stage of preparation – the process of cleaning the bones out of the rock in a laboratory in Canada – before its move to Australia. Fitzgerald said he hoped it would bring visitors to the museum for “the thrill and wonder of seeing something like this, for the first time”. “It’s the right fossil for a public museum that has a palaeontology program to acquire,” he said. “It’s fantastic for public display as an attraction, fantastic for public education, and a scientifically priceless fossil that will inspire and be used in research for generations.” The museum expects the skeleton will allow the scientific community to properly map, for the first time, the full “atlas of anatomy for triceratops” and allow them to definitively answer basic “vital stats” about the dinosaur, such as how big and heavy they really got. “Triceratops is almost like the last of the big guns – the really big name, household name dinosaurs – for which we don’t have answers to those questions yet,” said Fitzgerald. Despite being about to welcome such a scientifically significant specimen to his home city, Fitzgerald said that the triceratops wasn’t his favourite dinosaur. “Dinosaurs are still alive. Dinosaurs are all around us. We call them birds,” he said. “My favourite dinosaurs are penguins, because they are the best examples of dinosaurs that went to sea … Penguins evolved, we think from a flying ancestor. And that flying ancestor was a bird.”"
"“This is not the time to get complacent,” said Samantha Bee on a remote Full Frontal filmed during the second day of the Democratic convention. “We don’t know what’s about to happen! Next week, the president is going to accept the nomination from the White House, or Gettysburg, or Epcot Spaceship Earth, we just don’t know.” Which is why Full Frontal’s theme for the 2020 election, Bee revealed, is “expect the worst.” Case in point: though there are valid reasons to criticize Kamala Harris as Biden’s running mate, such as her “controversial record as a prosecutor or the fact that she met her husband on a blind date set up by the director of House Party”, Bee noted, Republicans are “instead choosing to criticize her for being a black woman”. Bee played a series of Fox News clips dismissing Harris’s bid as “identity politics”, calling the California “nasty” and claiming she was just “supposedly African-American”. “If these attacks on Harris’s gender and race sound familiar, it’s because a lot of them are just repeats of the bullshit used against Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama,” Bee explained. Less well-trodden territory is the Trump administration’s dismantling of the US post office ahead of an election that will probably depend on mail-in ballots. “We already know to expect that Republicans will do whatever it takes to prevent black and Hispanic people from voting,” said Bee, “but it’s truly terrifying to see how the pandemic is allowing them to suppress voter turnout at warp speed.” Still, “we should allow ourselves to feel hope for the future,” Bee concluded, “and then we should get right back to work, because when you are dealing with a pack of decomposing racists, you have to expect the worst.” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah blasted Fox News and other conservatives for trotting out the “not black enough” line against Kamala Harris. Noah played several clips in which conservative commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and Dinesh D’Souza called Harris, whose mother was born in India and whose father was born in Jamaica, not “African American” or “American black”. “You can dissect Kamala Harris’s heritage however you want,” said Noah. “But to say she’s not black?” You have to ask yourself, he added, “is she black enough to get kicked out of a restaurant back in the day in the Jim Crow South? Would she have been black enough to get redlined? Is she black enough to be kept out of a whites-only school as a little girl? Then she’s black!” What’s “especially ironic” about conservative media “trying to exclude” Harris from blackness, Noah continued, is that “it’s the reverse of what white America did for centuries: defining as many people as black as possible, whether they wanted it or not.” He explained the “one-drop rule”, the historical practice of defining blackness by the existence of a single black ancestor, which was “never meant to accurately portray the black experience or many shades of blackness itself. It was made with the singular intention of finding the most efficient way to exclude as many people as possible from whiteness. “So yes,” he concluded, “it is disgusting that these people are now trying to exclude Kamala Harris from being black.” Stephen Colbert continued the Late Show’s live coverage of the virtual Democratic national convention on Wednesday night, during which Barack Obama delivered a fiery speech to introduce Kamala Harris. The former president’s address was “everything I miss”, joked Colbert. “Obama! The constitution! A president! Haircuts!” Obama admitted that he had hoped “for the sake of our country” back in 2016 that Donald Trump “might show some interest in taking the job seriously”. “Look, sir, I know you’re the guy who coined the ‘hope’ slogan, but even your poster doesn’t buy that,” said Colbert. Nevertheless, the former president transitioned from “no drama Obama” to “trash talk Barack” and said Trump had “shown no interest in putting in the work, no interest in finding common ground. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t.” “It’s true, Donald Trump hasn’t grown since he was a toddler,” Colbert added. “He’s the only president who still needs a sippy cup.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers discussed a damning report from the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee which confirms that Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort briefed a Russian intelligence officer on campaign data. “This is as definitive as it gets,” said Meyers of evidence for election collusion with Russia, “and the worst part is, no one cares because it’s old news. It’s like finding out now that the characters on Lost really did die in the plane crash. “I just want to say to the Senate and Robert Mueller and everyone, everyone else involved in the Russia investigation: way to slow-walk it, fellas,” Meyers added. “You couldn’t have released definitive proof of a criminal conspiracy to cheat in the 2016 election before Trump botched the deadly pandemic? “I can’t wait till August 2022 when the Senate announces that, yes, Trump did burn all the mail-in ballots from blue states the day before the election.”"
"‘Daddy, my Daddy!” With these three words at the climax of the drama, Jenny Agutter 50 years ago created one of the best-loved roles in British cinema – as Roberta in Lionel Jeffries’ adaptation of E Nesbit’s 1906 novel The Railway Children. Now Agutter, who is about to start filming the tenth season of the BBC drama Call the Midwife, in which she plays Sister Julienne, has reprised her role in the story of the three children who move from London with their mother to a dilapidated cottage in Yorkshire, suddenly impoverished after their father disappears. This time she is taking part in a remarkable project by a charity set up to help rehabilitate prisoners into society. Her involvement – which comes as the 1970 film is enjoying a new lease of life on the BBC iPlayer – reflects her own commitment to working with prisoners and children from disadvantaged backgrounds, which stretches back to her youth. The actress has recently become an ambassador for Liberty Choir UK, a charity whose work begins inside prisons – through weekly rehearsals of a choir made up of prisoners and volunteers from community choirs – and which blossoms when the choir’s ex-offender graduates leave prison and are supported by the team and volunteers. The charity has been grappling with its role in the coronavirus pandemic, with prisons not allowing groups to congregate and with singing forbidden. How can it replace that human bond, where for two hours every week people gather in prisons for conversations, and care for one another’s lives?  The charity – which I co-founded in 2014 with my wife, MJ Paranzino – has had to replace that physical engagement with the men and women in prison with virtual support. Two weeks after lockdown was imposed, Liberty Choir Radio was launched – a one-hour show of musical history, chat and songs, with breathing and vocal exercises (such as in the live sessions) and – so crucial, this – messages of hope and solidarity from the volunteers, supporters and the Liberty Choir graduates themselves who know so well what lockdown feels like, and can imagine this extreme version of it; some prisoners are only getting out for 30 minutes at a time, and have to choose between a shower or a phone call.  Liberty Choir Radio is also being launched with National Prison Radio next month to take the charity into every prison in England and Wales – more than 100, with an audience of 80,000 prisoners – so the charity’s delivery has actually expanded in this frustrating time, albeit nothing beats being together and singing together in a room. Our new ambassador was asked if she would record a message for the prisoners and also read a passage from The Railway Children. The line everyone recalls is when Roberta (nicknamed “Bobbie”) first sees her much-missed absent father through the steam on the platform of the local railway station. He has been in prison for so many long, anxious months after falsely being accused of being a spy, and when his oldest and most resourceful child realises it is him, she runs into his arms weeping “Daddy, my Daddy!”. Well, how wonderful for those people in prison to hear such a touching reading by Agutter – some of them will know the story and for those who don’t, the words would still be meaningful to them. Edith Nesbit, the author, was a political activist, co-founder of the Fabian Society in 1884, a lifelong socialist and unconventional – she was seven months pregnant when she married and lived in a ménage à trois. Her father died when she was three and she felt his absence keenly all her life. What tugs at the heartstrings, hearing Agutter read the passage so movingly, with the same slight catch in her voice as her teenage self had 50 years ago, was the line about how the father feasts his eyes on the flowers in the garden, such a contrast to the ragged tufts of grass erupting from the cracks that was all he could see through his prison cell bars. Agutter has been engaged in social issues and volunteering all her life. She is a patron of the St Giles Trust, which supports prisoners and their families as well as other vulnerable groups.  In her early twenties, having acted since she was 11, Agutter moved to west Hollywood. Not long afterwards , she started volunteering at a school, Sheenway, in Watts, south Los Angeles, which was and still is a poor African American neighbourhood. Only 10 years earlier there had been riots where 34 people died and thousands were injured.  It was a fellow actor who asked Agutter to take over from him at Sheenway, but what made her decide it was something she wanted to do? “I just hooked into it immediately as something that intrigued me, partly because it was a very different place to where I lived and also because I had been given so many opportunities – whether it was doing The Railway Children, or getting into theatre and ending up at the National Theatre, or going to America and doing Logan’s Run,” Agutter said. “And I’ve been very grateful, but I’m also very aware that many people do not have opportunities in their lives. So there’s a part of me that has a strong sense of ‘I can’t just live by taking stuff and not giving stuff back.’ ” Agutter recently sent an email to Dolores Sheen, the 82-year-old executive director of Sheenway school (established by Dolores’s father, Dr Herbert Sheen) in a gesture of friendship which goes back 40 years. “It was after George Floyd’s death,” said Agutter, “and I said, ‘I hope you and the kids are doing OK, and I’m so sad and sorry that these things we thought would have passed by now have not passed.’ ” Her “giving stuff back” was to introduce the schoolchildren to Shakespeare. Agutter recalls taking a group of 10 to see Richard III which was playing in an affluent part of Los Angeles. The head had given permission and a coach was organised and then “as the children are leaving with me, Dee [Dolores] says, ‘Now you children, you just behave yourself because when you’re out there people will look at you and they’ll say, look at those black children behaving badly.’ “And I thought, ‘that’s a terrible thing to say’. But what she was doing was giving them a message, which is that is the way people behave – so you’ve got to be extra on top of it because that is how people assume – will be about your blackness and not about you being kids. So it was a lesson for me to learn.” What does Sheen remember about the actress when she first met her? “She was a vibrant young woman, full of purpose with an exciting charm who was quickly beloved by the students and faculty, and thank God she didn’t change. She invited us to be a part of her journey, and we welcomed her into ours ... an odyssey that takes children victimised by a zip code to heights of freedom for their minds and spirits – the Sheenway experience.” But why have they kept in touch over decades and continents (Agutter taught at Sheenway for six years)? “Jenny holds a special place in our history,” said Sheen, “and I shall always love her for the gifts of hope that she fed into the dreams of our students.” As Agutter remarks, neither the St Giles Trust nor Liberty Choir are “comfortable” charities – “It’s not dealing with children or ill health. It’s dealing with people that most people want to turn away from,” she said. “People that seem to have almost no hope in their lives, and we don’t want to recognise ‘no hope’.” So why not pick a safer option for a charity to support? One with an easier sell? “Lots of people are doing that already and it also seems obvious to me that if you don’t take care of the most difficult elements of our society, we’ll never get anywhere because they’ll always remain.”"
"Airing as the second night wrapped, The Daily Show recapped the first evening of the virtual Democratic national convention, in which numerous ordinary Americans, politicians and celebrities launched a weeklong celebration and call to action for candidate Joe Biden. One of the first and most moving speakers, said host Trevor Noah, was Kristin Urquiza of Arizona, whose father died of the coronavirus in June. “His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump,” she said of her father, adding that he felt “betrayed” by the president at the end of his life. “Wow, that was absolutely scathing,” said Noah of her remarks. “And she’s right, believing Donald Trump is truly one of the most harmful things you can do.” That fact was true even before Trump was president, he added – “just ask Atlantic City, his first two wives, or any graduate of Trump University.” But the real highlight of the first night was former first lady Michelle Obama’s speech, in which she calmly declared Donald Trump unfit to lead. Obama’s words were both “brilliant” and “ice cold”, said Noah, “and what made it even more devastating was that Michelle Obama wasn’t angry – she wasn’t yelling, she just stated Trump’s complete failure as a president as an obvious fact”. Noah also appreciated that Obama “didn’t shame people. In the last few years, it’s been standard in politics to shame people who don’t agree with you, and don’t intend to vote like you. A lot of it is fueled by the toxicity of online culture and how divided the country is right now, but instead of doing that, Michelle acknowledged that there are people who don’t want to hear what she has to say, and then she respectfully and earnestly engaged with those who might want to listen to her, and asked them to back Biden.” Trump, of course, did not respond to Obama’s words well; at an event celebrating the centennial of women’s right to vote, he criticized her speech for being taped instead of live. “Not only was it taped,” he said, “but it was taped a long time ago because she had the wrong [coronavirus] deaths.” “Goddamn, that is one of the biggest self-owns I’ve ever seen,” Noah responded, then imagined Trump’s logic: “A hundred fifty-thousand dead? I’ve killed 20,000 more since then, you idiot!” For the second night in a row, Stephen Colbert processed the DNC highlights live immediately following the virtual broadcast. The first night’s theme was “we the people”, while night two pivoted to “leadership matters” – “which, of course, has forced the GOP to rename the second night of their convention ‘all qualities matter’”, Colbert joked. The convention’s second night was a “magical evening”, he continued, which included segments on women’s suffrage, America’s healthcare crisis and a “beautiful travelogue of Joe Biden’s hairline – it’s evidently been on quite a journey these last 50 years”. The key speakers for the evening included former presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, who called the Oval Office under Trump a “storm center” rather than a command center. “That’s a good point, but I don’t think Bill Clinton gets to lecture anyone on what should happen in the Oval Office,” Colbert responded. “Those in glass houses should not be allowed near the interns.” Several speakers referenced Tuesday’s anniversary marking 100 years since women were constitutionally given the right to vote through the 19th amendment. “Fun fact: my mother was born three days after women could vote for the first time,” Colbert said of the occasion. “That’s how recently [this was]. Another fun fact: women have been able to vote for 100 years – Joe Biden has been in office for half of that.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon recapped Michelle Obama’s widely praised address on Monday night, in which she used Trump’s words against him. Calling Trump “the wrong president for our country”, Obama said he had had “more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he’s clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.” “At that point, Donald Trump squeezed his Diet Coke can so hard it turned into a diamond,” said Fallon. “I’m serious, right after that, a doctor took Trump’s blood pressure and the cuff exploded.” Trump was asked about Obama’s “in over his head” comment at an event celebrating the centennial of the 19th amendment, and responded: “She’s in over her head.” “Oh, yeah, that’s a good comeback,” Fallon mocked. “That was her insult against you. You can’t use her insult – every third-grader who can’t go back to school the next day knows that.”"
"There’s a scarcely believable discrepancy between the chilled, hirsute and blue-eyed Luke Treadaway who appears before me in shorts and T-shirt over Zoom from his parents’ house in Devon and the character he plays in his latest show. In The Singapore Grip, ITV’s big-budget costume drama for the autumn, the 35-year-old plays Matthew Webb, an uptight, bespectacled, sexually gauche 1940s colonial Brit. Impeccably outfitted in linen suit and panama hat, he’s everything Treadaway, after months of lockdown, is not. In Christopher Hampton’s adaptation of JG Farrell’s satire (which takes its title from a sexual technique), we first see our hero crawling injured from the roadside, adjusting his specs after the Japanese have routed western forces, the very emblem of the out-gunned and out-thought Brit.  Then we cut to six months earlier, when colonial Britain is in its complacent pomp and Matthew has just arrived in Singapore from Blighty to bury his dad (an all-too-short appearance from Charles Dance). He’s also there to battle with his dad’s evil, grasping business partner Walter Blackett (a chilling performance of reptilian sliminess from David Morrissey) for their rubber firm. “Hold on,” says Treadaway, running his fingers through his enviable locks, which clearly haven’t been tamed during quarantine. “Sexually gauche? I’m not sure that’s right.” Well , I point out, at a jazz dance Matthew finds himself on a veranda with two beautiful women, both striving to seduce him. He looks so uncomfortable his glasses seem poised to steam up. And he has just been on the dancefloor with spoiled Brit toff Joan who, at one point, pulls off her bra the better to seize Matthew’s attention, but he scarcely notices. “Oh, I don’t think that’s fair,” says Treadaway. “I’m coming down with tropical flu when they attempt to seduce me. At the end of that scene, I pass out on the carpet. I’m not totally sexually gauche, just very ill.” There is, I concede, much more to Matthew than mimsy, repressed Brit. “He’s the antithesis of the people he meets when he arrives in Singapore,” says the actor. “He is a vegetarian, an idealist, an internationalist. After going to an alternative public school in Suffolk, where he was taught that patriarchal differences in gender shouldn’t matter, he goes to Oxford, then works for the League of Nations. When he arrives to claim his inheritance, he is disgusted with how workers are exploited by the colonialists and at the racism his peers show for the locals.” Indeed, Matthew is the prism through which we gain an insight into British imperialism and its baffling complacency, with disaster just around the corner. “And that,” says Treadaway, “is why the story is so resonant now. You don’t have to look far to see the exploitation of workers in a more or less racist way – and realise colonial attitudes persist.” He checks himself. “Not that I’m saying all Brits are awful. Matthew is an example of someone disgusted by his countrymen and trying to be a good person.” The Singapore Grip was the third in Farrell’s trilogy about British colonialism, completed before his untimely death at the age of 44; he drowned in Bantry Bay, Ireland, in 1979. The first, Troubles, was set during the Irish war of independence. The second, The Siege of Krishnapur, dramatises the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and won the 1978 Booker prize. The final novel was set in early-1940s Singapore as British hubris unravelled – and this new dramatisation is the antidote to such conservative costume dramas as Downton Abbey or Victoria in which ITV seems to specialise. It goes where the national curriculum fears to tread, showing the racism and greed that underpinned the British empire. “It is the very antithesis of Dunkirk,” says Treadaway. “We like our disasters, us Brits, don’t we? We imagine the best of us comes out in them. But The Singapore Grip shows Britain at its worst, which is the opposite of Dunkirk. We’re divided against ourselves and terrible in conflict.” He hopes the show will enlighten British people about the fall of Singapore, a nearly forgotten disaster. “Churchill said it was the ‘largest capitulation’ in British history. Yet most of us have forgotten it or never known about it, in part because it doesn’t fit with Britain’s self-image.” Treadaway and the rest of the all-star cast, which includes Jane Horrocks and Colm Meaney, spent 10 weeks in Malaysia, filming in sets that recreated a British imperial Singapore that scarcely exists any more. “We filmed a lot in Penang and Kuala Lumpur, where there were old buildings that served as villas for the British colonial set. I remember they were near the botanical gardens in a kind of rural setting, but as we filmed I was really aware of the modern city thrumming away.” He came to feel towards modern Malaysia the way he felt about Iceland when he was filming the Sky drama Fortitude there. In Fortitude, he played British scientist Vincent Rattrey, sent to an isolated Arctic town to research a disturbing outbreak of cannibalism among polar bears. “I came home just raving about these places. Their tourist boards should pay me really.” Did working on The Singapore Grip make you proud or ashamed to be British? “Neither. I’ve never really been a patriot. If there was a patriotism for all of the people on this blue and green marble floating through space, I would be into that. Otherwise? Not really.” But, he suggests, let’s not overstate the politics. “There is also a love story at the heart of this drama. Love in the time of war is always compelling, isn’t it?” At the start, when Matthew is caught in the attack, he has only one thought: to find the Chinese woman he loves and get out of the living hell that Singapore has become. This puts him out of step with another strand of British racism: sexual hypocrisy. Asian women are for sex, not marriage. A French expat tells Matthew that, in their concerns about the purity of the race, the British are like Hitler, a comparison not often made in a costume drama. Treadaway is happy to talk about the role at length, in part because he has had little work since. “I was supposed to be doing a play in New York right now, but lockdown put paid to that.” He won’t tell me anything about it since he has hopes it may still be revived. So has lockdown been terrible for him? “Not at all! How can I complain when people are going hungry or losing their jobs? I’ve had a much easier time than most.” He spent most of it in London with his partner Ruta Gedmintas whom he met in 2011, on the set of the music-festival romance Tonight You’re Mine. “It’s been very peaceful. I’ve been able to recharge the batteries.” Don’t you worry about the future of the theatre? It was on stage, after all, that Treadaway performed his most acclaimed role, as the teenage protagonist in the National Theatre adaption of Mark Haddon’s novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, for which he won 2013’s best actor Olivier award. “I do – and I do think that the arts are everything that’s important for humans. But at the same time, how can I whine about theatre being underfunded when people are losing their homes and jobs?” Instead of acting during lockdown, Treadaway has been making music with his twin brother Harry, also an actor. They played together in a four-piece band called Lizardsun when they were kids and starred, while still at drama school, as conjoined twins in the droll 2005 mock rockumentary Brothers of the Head. For the shoot, the pair had to be attached to each other for 15 hours, wearing sewn-together wetsuits. Treadaway spent 10 years playing in largely ensemble casts – a posh comedy stoner in Attack the Block, a mythological cult leader in Clash of the Titans , a PoW in second world war drama Unbroken – before taking on a job even more challenging than being attached to his real-life brother for 15-hour stretches. In 2016, he starred in the adaptation of James Bowen’s bestselling memoir about begging and busking in London opposite a cat. In fact, in A Street Cat Named Bob, Treadaway starred opposite two ginger toms, since one was deemed not enough. “You do a scene and think it’s come out really well,” Treadaway says. “But then they go, ‘No, the cat was looking grumpy.’ They have to use the takes that were good for Bob.” More challenging still, both the author and the eponymous cat were on set – monitoring Treadaway and the cats’ performances for authenticity.  One final question: what exactly is a Singapore grip? He giggles. There are lots of theories advanced in the drama, one involving a paper clip, and I have read that it’s a a slang phrase for a vaginal rippling technique used by sex workers. “Is it now?” says Treadaway evasively. Then he leans in close and whispers: “You’ll never find out from me.”"
"John Mulaney: his specials on Netflix were like an awakening. It was one of those moments where it’s like: “I should probably give up,” when you see somebody doing what you do, but just so good. The couple on the train [Caroline Aherne and John Thomson] on The Fast Show – I’ve always loved that sort of shocking humour: inappropriateness suddenly coming out of nowhere when you’re not expecting it. Terry Pratchett’s Guards! Guards! manages to absolutely nail it: it gets to the nub of what it’s like to be doing a hard job in the middle of a city when you’re trying to do the right thing but the entire system is set up against you.  The scene with the baby-eating Bishop of Bath in Blackadder and the Young Ones episode where they make fun of Rick for being a virgin; I used to be able to recite every single word. Duck Soup by the Marx brothers – my dad had videoed it one night on the telly and I was obsessed with it as a kid. The mirror scene where Groucho and Harpo Marx are trying to mirror each other is one of the most beautiful pieces of physical comedy I’ve ever seen. My girlfriend – she’s the only person I’ve ever met who isn’t a comedian who only thinks in jokes. If she ever decided she needed to get on stage she’d probably be selling out arenas across the world.  I was doing the Download music festival and somebody shouted out: “You did this story last year.” So I replied: “Well, you’re gonna hate Iron Maiden on Saturday night.” I was a punk about 20 years too late, and I used to have a pair of assless PVC chaps that I used to wear on stage occasionally. I think anything with no ass in it has to be the funniest thing. I’ve had loads: bits shaved out and mohawks and big spiky hair, and the haircut that gets called “the Karen” these days – I had one of those in about 2002. The funniest one was the first time I got half my hair shaved off. Half the people told me I looked like Gary Oldman in The Fifth Element, the other half said I looked like Hitler. Once, in France, I accidentally ordered a plate of winkles. They were like little rubber bullets covered in garlic mayonnaise, and it was bloody awful. Thirty. It’s the magic number when deindividuation occurs, the point at which teachers stop being able to control a class and individuals become an audience. Doing a gig to less than that is almost impossible – it feels really awkward. “Bulb” which I use in place of a swear word. You don’t lose the moral high ground because it’s ridiculous. It levels the pair of you immediately. Black’s Unwinnable special is available on gofasterstripe.com"
"The weekend before last was something of a post-coronavirus reawakening for cinema. The release of Tenet at last gave mass audiences a new Hollywood blockbuster to queue up for, albeit in a masked, socially distanced, hand-sanitised way. Its healthy $53m opening weekend was as much cause for celebration as the movie world has been able to muster in 2020, but conspicuously absent from the party was Hollywood itself. Tenet opened in 41 countries but the United States was not one of them. Owing to the country’s shoddy handling of the pandemic, cinemas remain closed in most regions, including the key markets of California and New York. So much for “America first”. Another development compounded the US’s humbling: Tenet was not actually the highest-grossing movie in the world that weekend; that was The Eight Hundred, a lavish, patriotic Chinese war movie. In contrast to the US, most of China’s 70,000 movie screens are back open, which helped The Eight Hundred chalk up $69m. Rarely has the world’s cultural superpower looked weaker. For the past century or so, in terms of pop culture, America was the party. If it wasn’t happening in the US, it was barely happening at all. Whatever home-grown movies or TV programmes or music other countries produced, they usually paled in comparison to America’s output in terms of sophistication, glamour and influence. Other countries might occasionally muster a world-beating movie or band, an Amélie or an Abba – and the UK has benefited from the common language like no other country – but these were always mere drops in an ocean of American pop culture that lapped every shore. Many are wondering whether the era of US dominance is coming to an end, with the coronavirus pandemic the final nail in the coffin. “Covid has reduced to tatters the illusion of American exceptionalism,” wrote the anthropologist Wade Davis in Rolling Stone last month, observing that Americans “found themselves members of a failed state, ruled by a dysfunctional and incompetent government largely responsible for death rates that added a tragic coda to America’s claim to supremacy in the world”. On top of its out-of-control pandemic, today’s United States is a place of economic decline, rampant inequality and racial animosity. It is a place where culture is now discussed primarily in the context of warfare. In 2015, Donald Trump famously declared the American dream dead, and since he became president, you could say that’s one promise he has fulfilled. Even before Covid, the tide was already turning. Sticking with the movies for the moment, the distant, carefree days of early 2020 provided another jolt to US supremacy: for the first time, a non-English language movie won the Oscar for best picture: Parasite. Needless to say, Trump was not happy: “The winner is a movie from South Korea, what the hell was that all about?” he complained, “Can we get, like, Gone With the Wind back please?” More prophetic was Bong Joon-ho’s comment at the Golden Globes: “Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” Those floodgates are open, and not just for films. Globalisation is a two-way street, and the US now finds itself receiving as well as transmitting. On the small screen, the rise of streaming services has given global audiences more access to the non-American stuff they have been missing, and the language barriers are coming down. Take Money Heist, originally a hit on Spanish TV. In decades past, a US network might have bought the rights to it and remade it in New York with American actors. Instead, Netflix provided a platform for the original, and it became a global smash. There are still reams of quality US fare being made, but now it’s in direct competition with German sci-fi (Dark), Israeli spy thrillers (Fauda), Indian crime sagas (Sacred Games), even British teen comedies (Sex Education). Then there are ostensibly “American” series, such as Narcos, that sneakily lure audiences over the one-inch subtitle barrier: Netflix’s semi-fictional account of the US’s drug wars in Latin America has more dialogue in Spanish than English. Key to Netflix’s success has been its strategy of producing shows regionally, rather than simply pumping out American content. As a result, local industries have been reinvigorated. In the music industry, the streaming revolution has had a similar levelling effect. In decades past, the US was the gatekeeper: it owned most of the major record labels, it had MTV, and it was the market you had to crack before you could really say you’d made it (sorry, Oasis). When it comes to the biggest acts in the world today, though, you could be talking about Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, who was judged “the world’s biggest pop star” by Bloomberg. Or Korean boyband BTS, who have had four No 1 albums in the US charts in the past two years and who pack out stadiums to adoring American and British fans, many of whom have started learning Korean to understand the lyrics. In August BTS released their first English-language single, Dynamite, which went straight to the top of the US charts. The most-watched music video on YouTube, now at 7bn views, is Luis Fonsi’s Despacito – the Spanish-language original, not the English version with Justin Bieber. Thanks to the internet, what were once regional genres, such as K-pop or reggaeton, are now part of a global conversation. And people who might have been local stars, such as Colombia’s J Balvin, Spain’s Rosalía, Nigeria’s Burna Boy or France’s Christine and the Queens, are now international ones. US performers now queue up to collaborate with them. It usually follows that centres of political and economic power also rule the cultural sphere. But the US was primed to become the world’s cultural exporter, says Lane Crothers, professor of politics at Illinois State University and author of Globalization and American Popular Culture. “If you think about when the movie and music industries developed, they were periods of enormous economic growth and enormous cultural diversity in the US, as vast immigrant populations were arriving,” he says. “If you were going to produce something that was going to be popular in, say, New York in 1907 you were going to produce it for an audience that was already globally diverse, at least in the European, western hemisphere sense of that word, and so you had to figure out a way to make programming that was accessible to people across cultural and linguistic traditions. So when the opportunity emerged, post-second world war, to sell globally, US culture had already had plenty of practice.” After the second world war especially, the US was mindful of pop culture’s soft-power applications. It had a pretty clear idea of the image it sought to project: leaders of the free world, the land of prosperity, opportunity, health and happiness. Even supposedly “anti-establishment” rock music was viewed as a strategic asset during the cold war – all the better to contrast with the boring Soviet alternative. Which would you prefer? Communist folk music or Prince and Guns N’ Roses? Soviet propaganda films or Beverly Hills Cop? The American dream was both a national glue and an export commodity. As economies have grown around the world, the US has had more consumers to export to, but this has entailed certain compromises. In terms of cinema, for example, international box office now makes up 60 to 70% of Hollywood’s income. As China has grown into the world’s second-largest cinema territory over the past decade, Hollywood has been watching with dollar signs in its eyes. But as well as casting Chinese actors in bit parts to whet local appetites, Hollywood has been increasingly careful not to offend the country’s ruling Communist party, which controls which foreign movies get released and for how long. That has meant cutting out all references to locally contentious matters such as LGBTQ+ rights, Tibet, Tiananmen Square, Xinjiang, Taiwan (even Tom Cruise’s forthcoming Top Gun: Maverick quietly peeled the Taiwanese flag off his aviator jacket) – basically anything political. As a result, Hollywood content is no longer dictated by American-style free expression but Chinese-style self-censorship. As PEN America put it in a scathing report on Hollywood last month, “Chinese censors are playing a role in determining the content or message of movies that are released worldwide.” All of this is, potentially, to little avail anyway. While Hollywood has been abandoning its American values, China has been getting better at making its own blockbusters, no less sophisticated and far more relatable to the home crowd, as the success of The Eight Hundred underlines (fittingly, it is the story of a brave band of Chinese fighters resisting foreign invaders). In 2019, for the first time, four of the top 20 highest-grossing movies worldwide were Chinese. They played almost entirely within China, and the country is not particularly set on spreading its influence abroad, yet, but it could only be a matter of time. Last month, the government issued a document encouraging the development of homegrown sci-fi movies as a patriotic imperative, though the call for “implementation of Xi Jinping Thought” could be a barrier to export appeal. As with other film cultures such as India, South Korea and Japan, the growth of the local industry is hitting Hollywood’s share. The coronavirus pandemic hasn’t helped with that. Now, as China reopens ahead of the US, Hollywood is still looking to cash in. Next up is Disney’s live-action remake of Mulan, a $200m fantasy squarely aimed at the Chinese market. Again, conceding to the pandemic, Disney is not releasing Mulan in US cinemas and instead putting it out on streaming platforms. Mulan is getting a release in China, though, and it will doubtless do well there, despite regional pro-democracy movements campaigning for a boycott on account of lead actor Liu Yifei’s expressed support for Hong Kong’s police. Although as a Chinese story, directed by a New Zealander (Niki Caro), entirely cast with Chinese actors, and set in China but largely shot in New Zealand, it bears asking how American a movie Mulan really is. You could ask the same of much of “American culture”. Even before Parasite, only one American has won the best director Oscar in the past decade (Damien Chazelle for La La Land); the rest are Mexican, Taiwanese and European. Ostensibly American stories in film and TV are often set in sci-fi and fantasy worlds (Star Wars, Game of Thrones), or they’re nostalgia trips to America’s 20th-century golden age, such as Stranger Things. The only vibrant areas of contemporary US culture seem to be those that have been traditionally under-represented: African American and female-led storytelling, for example, from Barry Jenkins to Greta Gerwig, Ryan Coogler to Ava DuVernay. Or those that directly critique the country, from horror movies such as Get Out and The Purge to Joker’s dystopian drama, Childish Gambino’s conscious hip-hop This Is America, to true-crime series such as Making a Murderer. Genuinely aspirational showcases for the American dream are hard to find. Does Keeping Up With the Kardashians count? It is a little early to be making predictions of America’s demise. Let’s not forget, the US still has a virtual monopoly over the means of production and distribution. As well as movie studios, that includes most streaming platforms and social media: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO, Apple TV+, Disney+, YouTube, Facebook and Spotify (Swedish-owned but headquartered in the US). If the US can continue to pool the world’s talents and use them to make great art – as it often does – that could still be a good thing. But if insularity, nationalism and ruthless opportunism are America’s future, the rest of the world might well decide it can live without it. If America has stopped believing in the American dream, why should the rest of us?"
"He was one of Britain’s most celebrated playwrights, whose work – including The Birthday Party, The Homecoming and Betrayal – transformed the theatre world in the 1960s and 1970s. But now, to mark what would have been Harold Pinter’s 90th birthday, his widow, Lady Antonia Fraser, has spoken of her desire to see wider recognition of her late husband’s impact on British cinema. Pinter, who was awarded the Nobel prize for literature 15 years ago, died three years later at 78, after a writing career spanning more than half a century. “I now have the agreeable habit of showing his films, especially the ones people don’t know so well, in a little private cinema in Soho whenever I can,” she said in an interview staged by the Chiswick Book Festival. Among largely forgotten gems, Fraser lists the 1989 film Reunion, 1976’s The Last Tycoon and Langrishe, Go Down from 1978, starring Judi Dench and Jeremy Irons.  Fraser, 88, who was married to the playwright for 28 years, said she felt his screenwriting was regularly overshadowed and said she held out hope that his screen work might be celebrated in a season of films for the general public. One of her favourite films, she explained, was The French Lieutenant’s Woman, which Pinter adapted from the novel by John Fowles. “It is the dialogue that makes it work so well. I love that film,” she said. Pinter’s plays are often characterised as “menacing”. His commissioned adaptations of novels for the cinema are wider-ranging, though still often stamped with trademark curt and sinister exchanges. Among the best known are The Servant, Accident and The Go-Between, each directed by Joseph Losey, but he also wrote screenplays for the stylish 1960s thriller The Quiller Memorandum, F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Last Tycoon, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale and Elizabeth Bowen’s The Heat of the Day, starring Michael Gambon, Michael York and Patricia Hodge. When Fraser showed this last, little-known, film, she said her audience were particularly impressed. “No one could understand why it is not better known,” she said. Writing for the stage consumed Pinter’s imagination, but Fraser said he had another routine for screen work: “There was a great difference in his habits. If he was doing a commission, which would be a screenplay, as he never did a screenplay on spec, it was work. He sat down and did it. Whereas with a play, he might work all night. When he wrote his last play, Celebration, set in a restaurant, we were staying in a lovely house in Dorset we used to rent, and one night he swung out of bed. I asked what was the matter. He said: ‘It is that waiter. He won’t let me sleep.’ It was never like that with a film script.” However, Pinter did spend a year working on a screen adaptation of Marcel Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past that was never made. Fraser met Pinter when they were both married and in their early 40s. The romance provoked media attention which Fraser said “would seem ridiculous now”. “We were two middle-aged writers, not pop stars. We were not Beyoncé,” she said. “Though it is probably good for the soul to have the press flocking around your doorstep, asking you idiotic questions.” Some of Pinter’s early work was for television and was shown by ITV after Sunday Night at the London Palladium. His second stage play, The Birthday Party, closed after a week following initial bad reviews, but he made his name with The Caretaker, first produced 60 years ago. It became the must-see West End show in a week that also saw Orson Welles directing Laurence Olivier on stage. It is also one of two Pinter plays inspired by real London flats. Pinter lived in Chiswick in the late 1950s with his first wife, the actress Vivien Merchant, and their son Daniel. On the way downstairs he spotted a homeless man talking to another resident. The two became The Caretaker’s stage characters Aston and Davies. In 1975, Pinter left Merchant for Fraser, having previously had a long relationship with Joan Bakewell, an affair conducted in part in a flat in Kentish Town, London. The experience inspired Pinter’s best-known work, Betrayal, where the flat is moved to Kilburn. Fraser, however, said there were “enormous” features of this play that were absent from real life, including “the non-homoerotic male friendship” at its centre. “He simply didn’t have that with Joan’s husband. It is irrelevant. We were very much together when he was writing it, and he felt it was his play. Not someone else’s,” she said. Pinter, who was born and raised in Hackney, east London, was a keen sportsman and lifelong cricketer. Expressing her sorrow that he did not live longer, his widow said she felt “he would have enjoyed [lockdown] because of the chance it offered to read and write; all but for one thing: no cricket”. The playwright had originally trained as an actor, first at Rada and then at the Central School of Speech and Drama, and continued to take acting work throughout his life. “He had always felt, he told me, that if his career as a playwright had not taken off, his acting career would have grown and got better as he had become a character actor.” Although in frail health after a cancer diagnosis in December 2001, Pinter continued to act on stage and screen, performing in Samuel Beckett’s monologue Krapp’s Last Tape at the Royal Court theatre in 2006. He died on Christmas Eve two years later."
"British rapper and visual artist Kojey Radical was born in east London in 1993. He graduated from London College of Fashion with a degree in fashion illustration and his first EP, 23Winters, debuted at number three on the UK rap and hip-hop charts in 2016. His music mixes spoken word, hip-hop and alternative rap and grime to explore sociopolitical issues. He has collaborated with artists and musicians from rapper Ghetts to visual artist Hito Steyerl. His latest single, Good, is out on 11 September. Just a Touch of Love by Slave As I’ve been trying to write my album, I’ve kind of stopped interacting with music, but I have slowly been introducing myself to obscure pockets of it. Recently, I’ve been really into old funk albums. Funk is undefeated and there’s something very timely about the aesthetics behind black music from the 70s and 80s. My obsession has mostly been around the album covers. I recently had a little baby boy, so Just a Touch of Love by Slave has been giving me inspiration. The title song and Funky Lady are bangers. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Martin McDonagh’s film is about a mother who loses her daughter to murder. She wants justice and feels the police aren’t doing enough. She erects three billboards at the edge of the town to call out the police. But the problem is that the town is so small and is mainly old white people who love the police. They all go against the woman because she’s going against the police, even though it was her daughter who was attacked. The film makes really subtle statements about how racism is swept under the carpet in small towns like that. It was a hilarious but also a sad watch. Halfcast Podcast Halfcast Podcast is hosted by Chuckie Online, a TV and radio presenter who got his start in DJing. He discusses anything and everything – from the economy, and how black people can progress and build wealth, to why Wiley beefed with Stormzy. You never know what you’re going to get each week. I’ve always rated Chuckie’s approach to podcasting and his willingness to accept when he’s right and when he’s wrong. I think podcasts can be so opinion-based, and there’s often little accountability, but Chuckie takes his time to pay attention, which makes it a really comfortable listen. Sweet Chick This is a franchise founded by [rapper] Nas. It’s always been my favourite restaurant to go to in New York. They opened one in London last year. It was dope, because all the staff were super-duper friendly and accommodating and were fans of my music. It’s a nice place to hang out. I bump into cool people when I’m there, so it became this hub. The food is mainly fried chicken and waffles, American diner-style food but with black origins. I am going to go out on a limb and say it’s the best fried chicken and waffles I’ve ever had. Big Zuu’s Big Eats (Dave/UKTV Play) Being in lockdown, I was cooking from home a lot more and being able to see someone like me, from the same ends as me, care about food and really put their heart into it – and not really have to change who they are for the sake of being on TV – I had to respect it. Big Zuu does chef up, but I like it when he does simple stuff like a chicken burger – things that are familiar to me, but with fresher ingredients.  The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson It’s about helping yourself by looking at the world and figuring out the best way to exist in your own state of being content. To me, that was a big goal. It gets to the point really quickly. It teaches you that everything you do in life doesn’t have to be for the sake of public opinion, and the more you start doing for yourself and pleasing yourself, the happier you’ll be in the long run. The state of opinion is constantly changing and you can’t place your self-esteem in the hands of something that will ultimately change."
"“I don’t know what’s going on, but I’ve got chills, I’ve got nausea,” said Stephen Colbert airing live after the final night of the Republican national convention. “It’s either the onset of Covid, or seeing 1,500 people with no social distancing, no masks and no testing packed on to the South Lawn of the White House. “I know Republicans like voter suppression,” he added of the packed gathering. “I didn’t know they kicked it up to voter extinction.” Before Donald Trump capped the convention with a nearly 70-minute speech, he was introduced by his daughter and “American Girl doll just following orders” Ivanka Trump, who boasted about working with her father to pass “nine pieces of legislation to combat the evil of human trafficking”. “And then I watched him tell one of those human traffickers that he wished her well,” the Late Show host added, referring to Trump’s friendly comments about alleged Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who was arrested last month in New Hampshire. The president’s daughter concluded her speech with a straightforward message: “Washington has not changed Donald Trump. Donald Trump has changed Washington.” “She’s right, actually, and that’s weird,” Colbert said. “You see, the presidency proverbially changes the occupant. It matures them, it ages them.” Colbert pulled up side-by-side photos of Barack Obama at the beginning and end of his presidency and joked: “The guy on the left looks like he should be persuading the guy on the right to give up his car keys. “But Trump doesn’t do any of the stuff that matures you or ages you,” Colbert continued, “like worrying about the American people or feeling responsibility for protecting them or evidently anything else.” Looking at Trump in 2016 and now in 2020, “I guess it’s true what they say: taxidermy don’t cracks-a-dermy,” he joked, especially when compared with Colbert’s evolution in the same time frame – “the last four years are like Trump is Dorian Gray and we’re the picture”. Colbert also turned to Trump’s keynote speech, a true-to-form ramble filled with too many inaccurate boasts to count, especially about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. But “amid all the lies, he did get one thing right”, said Colbert: “Americans are exhausted,” Trump said. “Yes, we are, after listening to you for 70 minutes,” Colbert responded. “But at last it’s over, after four nights of bone-chilling nonsense from America’s top trash bags.” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped the “extremely boring” third night of the Republican convention, in which Mike Pence – a man “so boring that during his mid-life crisis, he bought a minivan” – delivered the evening’s main speech. It’s interesting, Noah noted, how Pence has long been able to “hide so much bullshit underneath the veneer of a respectable small-town pastor”. While Trump says “bullshit in a bullshit way” – barely disguised BS, as in the clip Noah played in which Trump claimed to love the Bible but badly deflected requests to name a single passage. Pence, meanwhile, “comes across as a reasonable guy”. And the vice-president’s speech on Wednesday night was “Pence at his finest”, said Noah, “cool, calm and full of BS”. Pence doesn’t so much lie as imply, Noah explained, which is why he claimed Americans wouldn’t be safe under an anarchic Joe Biden presidency, which conveniently elides the coronavirus present. “People are not safe now!” Noah retorted. “Forget the riots, coronavirus is waiting to punch me in the lungs as soon as I leave the house.” Most egregious, Noah continued, were Pence’s boasts about Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, “which, to hear him tell it, was more perfect than Trump’s call with Ukraine”. “I’m actually kinda impressed by how much cow excrement Pence managed to pack in here,” Noah said of the speech, in which Pence bragged about the delivery of personal protective equipment in recent months. “What he doesn’t mention is that America was so disorganized on PPE that nurses were wrapping themselves up in garbage bags,” Noah said. As for Pence’s claim that Trump’s actions in March bought “invaluable time” for America to mobilize its response, Noah had a reality check: “What would’ve been even better was if you actually used that invaluable time, to actually do that national mobilization.” Finally, Pence wrapped up his BS with “one amazing, new, terrible” slogan for the Trump campaign: “Make America Great Again … Again.” “This new slogan just sounds like someone got hit in the head with a bag of hammers,” Noah said of the confusing rebrand. “Because what’s implied with ‘Make America Great Again … Again’ is that at some point during your presidency, you fucked up.”"
"Artemisia National Gallery, London, 3 Oct–24 JanIt looked for a while as if the most anticipated show of the year – perhaps the past decade – might be cancelled by Covid-19, and Artemisia’s long road to recognition blocked yet again. But tickets are now on sale. Italian Baroque genius, precocious successor to Caravaggio, fearless traveller, defiant witness against her rapist in court – Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1653) is the all-round heroine of art. She painted women as strong as herself: Cleopatra grasping the asp, Lucretia choosing suicide over dishonour, Judith cutting off the head of the despotic Holofernes with a vigour scarcely seen in art. All of Artemisia’s images are narratives condensed into spectacular single-scene dramas, and painted with the strongest originality. Indeed, she was the first woman to portray herself in the physical act of painting, sleeves rolled and sweat on her brow. This survey will include several self-portraits and many stunning images of women from history, religion and myth, most never shown in this country before. Along with actual court testimony and the artist’s passionate letters, it will be a phenomenal show from first to last.

Laura Cumming Summer of ’85 Directed by François Ozon; in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema, 2 OctAdolescent amour fou, accessorised with flicked hair and billowing shirts, and playing out to the Cure and Bananarama: the latest from the prolific French director François Ozon captures first love in all its naivety and DayGlo intensity. Adapted from Dance on My Grave, the 1982 young adult novel by British author Aidan Chambers, this heady, ill-starred romance was on (cancelled) Cannes’s official selection list, and is among the selected films at the San Sebastian film festival later this month. Transposing the action from Chambers’s Southend to a seaside town in Normandy, Ozon sheds his urbane skin and relinquishes the storytelling to lovestruck 16-year-old Alexis (Félix Lefebvre). Alexis is all at sea without many friends when he meets 18-year-old David (Benjamin Voisin) when the older boy rescues him from a capsized dinghy. It’s Alexis’s voice that guides us through this doomed love affair; his perspective that gives the story its super-saturated sense of teen melodrama. The result is a film that feels as fresh as the 80s citrus colour palette, and as heartfelt as sixth-form poetry.

Wendy Ide Sufjan Stevens: The Ascension Asthmatic Kitty, 25 SepGigs continue to be hard to stage this autumn, with safety at a hard angle to profitability. One recompense is the deluge of albums delayed by coronavirus. Even in this current bonanza, a Sufjan Stevens outing is an occasion. Sufjan albums tend to come in two forms – whispered and intense, or rococo and intense. The Ascension – Stevens’s eighth overall – lands with a digital crescendo in the latter camp. He has called it “a lush, editorial pop album”. Recalling, in its scope, the electronic maximalism of Age of Adz (2010), and coming five years since the highly personal Carrie & Lowell, The Ascension finds Stevens wrestling with our slowly unfolding apocalypse. Clocking in at 80 minutes, it represents “a call for personal transformation and a refusal to play along with the systems around us”. Tracks released so far combine this mystical artist’s wide-ranging spirituality with unapologetically pop treatments. On the elliptical, 12-minute-long album closer,America, Stevens conflates the personal and the political, combining a loss of faith with swelling digitals.

Now it’s more urgent and timely than ever. It has duly been confirmed to open both the London and New York film festivals over the next couple of months. The five-part anthology series chronicles the experience of London’s Caribbean community across three decades, beginning with Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech in 1968. Each episode foregrounds a different real-life character, including Letitia Wright as British Black Panthers leader Altheia Jones-LeCointe, Malachi Kirby as civil liberties campaigner Darcus Howe and Star Wars’ John Boyega as Metropolitan Police anti-racism pioneer Leroy Logan. Boyega’s, especially, is an exciting role in an autumn full of great casting.

Michael Hogan Inside Story by Martin Amis Jonathan Cape, 24 SepMartin Amis’s 15th novel (subtitled How to Write) begins with a nod to Vladimir Nabokov, the author who, along with Saul Bellow, has done the most to shape Amis’s distinctive style. Nabokov, Amis writes, was “a very rare case: a writer to whom things actually happened”. As such, “he had every right and warrant to attempt an autobiographical novel”. Which is, of course, just what Amis is giving us now, a novel that appears to veer only marginally from the truth, a memoir dressed up as fiction. Inside Story, in prose that is disarmingly avuncular, self-revealing, digressive, takes us through the signature events of Amis’s life from cradle to late middle age. It feels as if Amis has found his mature voice, one that is warm, generous and deeply moving, whether on the subject of fatherhood, love or friendship (particularly with Christopher Hitchens). This is not only the best book Amis has written in years; it is up there with Money and London Fields as the finest work he’s produced.

If not, well… Whatever he turns up, Bower’s book joins a raft of political titles this autumn, including Beyond the Red Wall: Why Labour Lost, How the Conservatives Won and What Will Happen Next? by the leading pollster Deborah Mattinson, which promises both new research and interviews with constituents; and This Land: The Story of a Movement by Owen Jones, an “insider’s honest and unflinching appraisal” of where the left went wrong in 2019.

Rachel Cooke Death of England: Delroy Olivier, London SE1, late OctOne of the most ferocious dramas of this stricken year roared across the stage in February. Death of England, which closed a few weeks before lockdown, was a monologue written for a furious white British male by two black British men, Clint Dyer and Roy Williams. Designers Sadeysa Greenaway-Bailey and ULTZ strikingly reconfigured the Dorfman as a St George’s Cross, torn bleeding from the Union Jack. Rafe Spall gave a tremendous performance, propelled by rage, taunting the audience with possibilities of racism. The same writers and designers have now returned to the National with a companion piece; they are the first artists to work in the building since it closed five months ago. Giles Terera, who was impressively chilly last year in Rosmersholm, stars as Delroy, the black best friend of the character played by Spall. As before, Dyer directs.

"After this summer’s protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, “there was definitely a sense that this could be the moment of systemic change”, Trevor Noah said on Wednesday’s Daily Show, in which he addressed the shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man, by two police officers in Kenosha, Wisconsin. “But as we’ve been reminded of yet again, there is still a long way to go.” The two officers shot Blake seven times in the back, in front of his children, paralyzing him. In horrific cellphone footage of the incident, Blake appears to calmly walk away from the officers, who follow with their guns pointed; they open fire into his back as he opens his car door. “I’ll never get used to how quickly police go from issuing commands to using deadly force,” Noah said. “Whatever happened to warning shots? Or tackling a suspect? Like are we really meant to believe that the only two options a cop has is do nothing or shoot somebody in the back seven times?” In the wake of the shooting, people have again taken to the streets in protest, which makes sense, said Noah. “Black people are tired of hearing ‘I’m sorry’ and then nothing happening. Because essentially what they’re really hearing is, ‘I’m sorry this is happening, and I’m sorry that it’s going to happen again.’” Noah also addressed the racist double standard in treatment and coverage of Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old white, self-styled “militia” member who is suspected of involvement in shooting three protesters on Tuesday night, killing two. Despite carrying his assault weapon down the street afterwards, three cop cars passed him by; he wasn’t arrested until the next morning. Rittenhouse claimed on Facebook to be “defending a business” but “that’s some bullshit”, said Noah. “No one has ever thought, ‘Oh, it’s my solemn duty to pick up a rifle and protect that TJ Maxx.’ They do it because they’re hoping to shoot someone. “Enough with this ‘militia’ bullshit,” he added. “This isn’t the battle of Yorktown. It’s a bunch of dudes threatening people with guns.” The police treatment of Rittenhouse was “illuminating”, Noah continued, in that it “really made me wonder why some people get shot seven times in the back, while other people are treated like human beings and reasoned with and taken into custody with no bullets in their bodies”. “How come Jacob Blake was seen as a deadly threat for a theoretical gun that he might have and might try to commit a crime with, but this gunman who was armed and had already shot people – who had shown that he was a threat – was arrested the next day, given full due process of the law and generally treated like a human being whose life matters? “Why is it that the police decide that some threats must be extinguished immediately while other threats get the privilege of being defused?” The answer, Noah concluded was clear: “The gun doesn’t matter as much as who is holding the gun, because to some people, black skin is the most threatening weapon of all.” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee recapped the Republican national convention, which was “scraping the bottom of the barrel for any trolls and rapists who have a webcam and a working CompuServe account”. “We hate to give these people attention,” Bee continued of the numerous “walking human memes” given airtime at the convention, such Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St Louis couple and “midlife crisis Bonnie and Clyde” who went viral for brandishing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters. “But we also can’t write them off because – funny story – the Republicans have shown a willingness to let fringe lunatics take over their party.” This is already happening, Bee continued, with the primary elections of about 50 QAnon believers in races across the US. While Bee did not want to give the QAnon conspiracy any more attention, “we should be worried”, she said. “I know it’s easy to focus our attention on the fact that the future of the world will be decided by one of the two people you’d least want to sit between on a plane,” she concluded, “but voting in November is more than just the presidency. Down-ballot races are our only change to right the wrongs of the far right.” Stephen Colbert aired live after the third night of the Republican national convention, which he has recapped all week. But on Wednesday, the Late Show host abstained from watching the spectacle. “Why should we pay attention to what they’re saying if none of what they’re saying tonight is about what’s happening in America right now?” he asked. “Why should we watch their reality show if it doesn’t reflect our reality? Why subject ourselves to their lies, which stick to your soul like hot tar? Lies like: Donald Trump cares whether you live or die.” On Wednesday afternoon, it was reported that the CDC downgraded coronavirus testing guidelines – those who were in contact with infected persons may no longer need to be tested if they’re asymptomatic, despite repeated evidence that half of transmissions occur before symptoms appear. The CDC was pressured to make the changes by Trump administration officials, which means “we’ve reached the point where Donald Trump is dictating our health regulations”, said Colbert. “Hey, CDC!” he added, snapping his fingers. “This is our lives! Either grow a pair and stand up to this clown or at least be honest and change the Hippocratic oath to: ‘First, do no harm, unless it makes the president look bad, in that case, bag ’em and tag ’em.’ “Once again, we are watching a basic function of our government, that has always been apolitical, die in front of our eyes,” Colbert said. “We are one news cycle away from the CDC warning that mail-in ballots give you chlamydia.”"
"Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, has defended his decision to move a bust of the museum’s slave owning founding father, after criticism the decision did little to address structural racism at the institution. As the museum in central London prepares to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown, a likeness of Sir Hans Sloane – whose collection was partly funded by enslaved labour on Jamaican sugar plantations – was moved from its stand in the Enlightenment gallery to an adjacent cabinet, which contains panels that explain Sloane’s collection was built on “European imperialism”. Fischer said the move was part of the next step of the museum’s work to place its connections to colonialism and slavery “very openly at the heart of the museum” and he said he wanted to put Sloane and his legacy in the “limelight”. Sloane, who married a wealthy sugar plantation heiress and whose artefacts provided the starting point for what became the British Museum, is honoured by numerous place names in the capital, including Sloane Square. But the move was criticised for ignoring the calls for the museum to take more direct steps to address concerns over race at the institution, such as diversify its curatorial team – it has one black curator at present – and return stolen artefacts, such as the Benin bronzes, which were looted in 1897. Dan Hicks, the curator of world archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and author of the forthcoming book The Brutish Museums, said he welcomed the museum discussing its past, but said a thorough decolonisation process “must involve more than curators rewriting the labels”. He said: “As far as I know, there were no public calls for Hans Sloane’s bust to be moved from one part of the museum to another. Instead the BLM calls are for the permanent return of stolen objects to Africa, and for the British Museum to take effective action to diversify its curatorial team.” Hicks added that the new text panels accompanying the bust fail to say the British Museum’s connections with colonialism continued long after its foundation in 1753, and “continue into the present”. Fischer said the museum is part of the Benin Dialogue Group, which is working with the kingdom of Benin on loaning objects back to Nigeria, and defended what he called the museum’s “impressive track record” on preserving cultural heritage. The director confirmed the British Museum’s movement of its founding father was triggered in part by the wider discussion about racism that followed George Floyd’s death. He said: “I’d say this is an ongoing process and this is a very important step we’re taking there. But it’s in the context of an overall research into the history of our collection.” But he added that he had another responsibility to “maintain what is probably the world’s greatest place to learn about the history of humankind in all its complexity and richness, diversity and interconnectedness”. Fischer said there was no plan to return stolen items from the British Museum’s collection, but added that the museum had a responsibility to be “fully engaged in dialogue” with museum’s around the world and in particular in South America, Central America, Africa and Asia. Fischer said that criticism that the museum’s support for the Black Lives Matter movement was “performative” and hypocritical was misplaced. In June, he was heavily criticised after writing a blogpost that stated that the museum was “aligned with the spirit and soul of Black Lives Matter everywhere”. “I was completely serious when I published that blog,” he said. “And I think if you ask the members of the black community from around this country and from around the world that we work with, they will tell you that I’m sincere about this.” Sloane’s collection also helped set up the Natural History Museum, which told the Guardian it has started a review to “understand the history of our institution” and its connections to colonialism and imperialism. “We will use this research to take a detailed look at our collection and our history so we can tell the full story of the origins of the collection and the people represented in the museum,” the spokesperson added. Fischer was speaking on the same day the British Museum announced it was reopening on 27 August with severely reduced capacity after the Covid-19 outbreak. Only 2,000 people will be allowed into the museum each day, which will give visitors access to about 9,000 items from its 80,000-piece collection. Fischer said the museum was abiding by UK government guidelines by capping the number of visitors, making people book tickets in advance and imposing a one-way system, which he said made visitors see the collection differently. He said: “I’ve done this several times to test it and it blew my mind. It was so fascinating and exciting. You discover so many things. You discover them anew, you see them differently because of that. I didn’t expect it but this is what happens.”"
"New survey data from the Australia Council highlights the vital and growing role played by the arts and culture in the lives of Australians, as the industries themselves face more challenges than ever. The latest edition of the National Arts Participation Survey, released on Wednesday and following on from reports in 2009, 2013 and 2016, canvassed a representative sample of 8,928 Australians about their views about and participation in arts and culture. The top-level statistics are impressive: few other industries can boast sustained engagement with 98% of the population. The survey shows a significant rise in both the number of Australians who believe in the positive impacts of the arts, and the number who support it being publicly funded. It finds 23 out of every 25 Australians listened to recorded music in 2019, a third of them daily; and 82% of Australians engaged with the arts online, the majority through streaming music. We’re also keen readers, with 72% of us reading for pleasure; nearly half of all Australians read a novel in 2019. Perhaps most impressively, all the key metrics are increasing – or at least were increasing, before Covid-19 struck. The performing arts were a standout: two-thirds of Australians attended live performances in 2019, with each art form growing their audiences. Live music was up from 43% in 2016 to 48% last year. Live theatre attendance was up from 30% in 2016 to 37%. Gallery visits were up from 33% to 37%, dance attendance was up from 24% to 29% and attendance at writers’ festivals and literary events up from 15% to 22%. We’re creating art in our own lives too. The survey says more than 9 million Australians regularly make or collaborate in the making of art. Some of the participation figures are startling. It’s perhaps not surprising that nearly 5 million Australians paint, draw or create visual art, and 3 million play music. But who knew that one in six Australians participated in community art, or that 2.8 million identify as creative writers? As with the data on attendance, the figures for creative participation are also on the rise. The survey data is crucial information at a time of crisis in the cultural sector. The coronavirus pandemic has led to the near total shutdown of the live performance sector, and led to crippling job losses in arts and cultural employment. Although the federal government and the states and territories have announced emergency funding packages, 15% of payroll jobs in arts and recreation have been lost since March, and the Morrison government’s $250m rescue fund is still months away from delivery. Drill further into the Australia Council study, and fascinating insights are revealed. Australians seem overwhelmingly convinced of the value of the arts and culture, with 84% of those surveying agreeing on the positive impacts of culture – up from 75% in 2016. Two-thirds of those responding said art and creativity helps children develop, 56% said it had positive impacts on our sense of wellbeing and happiness, and the same percentage thought it helped to deal with stress, anxiety or depression. At a time when Australia faces intensifying mental health challenges, this study is further evidence that the arts and culture has a policy role to play beyond the subordinate portfolio in a junior ministry where it currently languishes. Australians’ appreciation of arts and culture was reflected in other responses. Big and increasing majorities of respondents agreed that artists should have freedom of expression (76%, up 15 points from 2016); that the arts should be an important part of education (73%, up 12); and that the arts allow us to connect with others (53%, up 15). Significantly, support for public funding of the arts was at 63%, up 12 percentage points from 2016. When the survey looked at specific groups in our society, the value of culture was even more evident. Younger Australians, First Nations respondents, and Australians from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds all showed passionate levels of engagement well above those of the general population. Eight-three per cent of younger Australians attended arts events in 2019, and for regional and remote First Nations respondents, that figure increased to an astonishing 91%. Creative participation for First Nations groups was higher across nearly every dimension. While the blizzard of statistics will delight the data nerds, the study also asked more nuanced and qualitative questions about the role and value of culture in Australian society. Research firm Patternmakers’ Tandi Palmer Williams conducted some of the focus groups that fed into the National Arts Participation Survey. She told Guardian Australia that one of the key takeaways of the focus groups was “a fairly widespread understanding” of the benefits of art and culture – but one that wasn’t necessarily matched by an understanding of how arts and creativity are funded. “Most people could appreciate the integral value of the arts in the lives of children in their education, or in bringing communities together in social cohesion,” Palmer Williams said. “But when we talked about the role of governments in supporting that, there were mixed views.” She suggests that one motivation for this disconnect may be a general distrust of politicians delivering cultural funding fairly. All in all, the National Arts Participation Survey paints a portrait of Australian culture as an immensely vibrant and fertile sphere of our society. While the performing arts are struggling to recover from the devastation of Covid-19, the survey shows that for most Australians before the pandemic, the arts and creative culture was a vital part of their everyday lives. “This is really comprehensive, really robust data,” the Australia Council’s Wendy Were said, pointing to the large sample size of the survey. “This isn’t a specific sub-section of the public, this is a broader Australian perspective.” But the survey also poses uncomfortable questions about the support that governments provide for the arts, and it questions whether Australia’s cultural leaders are effectively articulating that value to policymakers. “One of the things that is really important is that this work was done pre-pandemic. It highlights where we were headed before Covid-19,” Were points out. “As a result, it’s a portrait of what we stand to lose.”"
"My friend and former colleague Don Steward, who has died aged 69 of cancer, was a curator of natural history at the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent, where he worked from 1978 until his retirement in 2016. From 1979 to 2008 he was also a leading figure in the North Staffordshire group of the Geologists’ Association, and hosted countless committee meetings of that branch at his museum.Don was born in Beeston, Nottingham, the younger child of Donald Steward, an insurance assessor, and Maude (nee Nixon), a busy stay-at-home mum. He attended Brunts grammar school, Mansfield, graduated from the University of Reading in 1972 with a degree in geology and zoology, and then earned a master’s in oceanography at Southampton University in 1973. His first job was at the City of Bristol Museum & Art Gallery, specialising in geology, before moving in 1978 to Stoke as the first assistant keeper of natural history at the City Museum & Art Gallery, where he was part of the team that oversaw its extension and reopening in 1981.He completed his museum qualifications at Leicester University while working in Stoke, and was later promoted to senior assistant keeper of natural history in 1990, eventually rising to lead the natural history section, first as senior museum officer in 2001 and then as curator of natural history in 2008. In whatever role he fulfilled, Don worked tirelessly as an active exhibitor and educator, and was particularly proud of leading a series of popular “RockWatch” sessions at the museum for budding geologists. As both teacher and curator he was knowledgable, informative and inspiring. With an easy-going, laidback nature and an understated sense of humour, as a work colleague he was caring and supportive. An associate of the Museum Association, Don also wrote various invaluable papers on the geology of North Staffordshire, and from 1977 onwards contributed to the Geological Society’s national scheme for geological site documentation, providing information on the geology of his local area. In retirement he enjoyed gardening and spending time with family and friends. He is survived by his sister, Susan, and four nephews and nieces."
"I knew I’d found the spot when I saw a white and pink truck in between the trees. It was Saturday afternoon in West End park – smack in the middle of Brisbane suburbia – and I’d spent the last 10 minutes walking past picnicking families searching for Jaguar Jonze’s Brisbane festival concert. The concert’s time and location was never publicly announced, but there were several groups – some wearing the Taiwanese-Australian singer’s merch – already camped out on the grass. Staff in Brisbane festival uniforms burst from the van, encircling us with pink bunting. The side of the vehicle (dubbed the Bandwagon) lifted to reveal a bright pink stage, kitted out with mics, amps, and streamers raining from the roof. Jonze and her band climbed aboard and started their 30-minute set. Organising a concert and not telling anyone about it sounds like a fireable marketing error. But the people behind this year’s Brisbane festival promise it was completely intentional. Covid-19 forced the annual festival to rethink its largely indoor program. Unprecedented times call for unprecedented practices. With the self-proclaimed goal of “bringing people together to celebrate without encouraging crowd gathering”, the team scrapped its plans and devised a new schedule of socially distanced shows. The result? A total of 490 performances across 91 events – 73 of which are free – that kicked off on Friday, 4 September and will run for three weeks. Much of the festival is outside: artist Hiromi Tango’s Rainbow Circles (Healing Circles) – brightly coloured luminescent rainbow arches – dance across West Village garden every night; one of the festival’s few paid events is a live-action B-grade thriller that audiences can watch from the safety of their cars. Events are made to feel spontaneous, discoverable. Puppeteers, flash mobs and acrobats are expected to appear along Brisbane’s cycle and walk tracks over the weeks. Six giant finches, created by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, are perched across city landmarks. Walking home on Friday, I came across a socially distanced dance party and joined the 30 or so other people solo-dancing to Silento’s Watch Me in taped-off 4m by 4m squares. Perhaps the most innovative and ambitious offering is Street Serenades: a series of neighbourhood concerts taking place in each of the city’s 190 suburbs throughout the three week festival, from the back of a decked-out van. The event series was clearly designed with Covid in mind: all performers are locals (the Queensland border is still firmly closed), and while the list of artists is public, showtimes and locations are only advertised hours ahead of select gigs via the festival’s Facebook event page (a way of keeping crowd numbers low). Though considerate (and necessary), these precautions also mean that the pop-up concerts feel nothing like concerts. On Friday night, I watched Troy Cassar-Daley perform to two dozen people sitting on plastic chairs in a park along the Brisbane River; families and couples walking on the footpath slowed and squinted as they passed, as if they too were wondering why one of Australia’s most famous country musicians had been pasted into a scene more fitting of a local busker. West End park on a weekend afternoon was also a far cry from the underground venues Jonze has played. There was no moshpit. A gaggle of toddlers towards the front bounced out of time. A dog ran over and licked the heat from my hand. On Sunday, I saw indie-folk duo the Dreggs perform out of the same van in Brisbane’s eastern suburbs. As they went to introduce their last song, they stopped short: “I’d love to explain what it’s about … but there are children around,” one of them laughed. I miss venues so small and crowds so packed that you walk out wearing someone else’s sweat. But I have missed live music more. And I walked away from a weekend of pop-up shows realising two things. One: a lot of other people feel the same. As soon as the music started at any show, heads began to turn and foot-traffic slowed. Across the road from Jonze’s gig in West End park, residents emerged from their apartments to lean against the balconies. When the Dreggs finished their last song and moved to pack up at New Farm, the crowd screamed “encore!”. Every performer said how hard the last few months have been. “I’ll never take music for granted again in my life, let me tell you that,” Cassar-Daley sighed in between songs on Friday. Jonze, who herself tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in the year, looked around in actual wide-eyed disbelief and told the crowd, over and over, how “insane” it felt to play a gig for the first time in five months. Two: I realised that we are all willing to suspend disbelief to experience this again. In theatre, we collectively promise to ignore that what we’re about to see is merely fictional or fantastical. At a live gig, we promise to let go of the outside world and get lost in the noise. The Street Serenades required us all to suspend a different kind of disbelief: the feeling that this sort of experience jars impossibly with our reality. We cannot play away the fact that we are living in a global pandemic. Every performers’ set-list small-talk included some mention of coronavirus. Jonze took it one step further, noting that she had selected her outfit – a red jumpsuit covered in spiky yellow and blue blotches – because it looked like it had “a little virus all over”, before jumping into a grungy rendition of Britney Spears’ Toxic. But as the grass turned blue on Sunday evening, and the boys from the Dreggs sat back down to attempt a song they had written in lockdown, and a group of children started playing some sort of advanced game of tag in front of us, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that our lives have changed forever. Something precedented had become possible, once again."
"In the mid-1960s John Lennon wrote some lyrics that would eventually become the Beatles classic In My Life. He later described his rejected first draft, which name-checked places near his Liverpool home, as “the most boring sort of ‘what I did on my holidays bus trip’ song”. In the original version, among the “places I’ll remember all my life” was the Abbey cinema in Wavertree. “In the circle of the Abbey, I have seen some happy hours,” he wrote. Fellow Beatle George Harrison was also a regular. By 1979, the year before Lennon was shot dead in New York, the Abbey, a magnificent art deco edifice that could accommodate more than 1,800 people in its vast double-tier auditorium, had reached the end of its life as a cinema. Now a campaign has been launched to save the building amid fears that its owners, the supermarket chain Lidl, could seek to demolish it and replace it with a purpose-built store on the site. An application for the Abbey to be listed has been submitted to Historic England, and almost 2,500 people have signed an online petition calling for the building’s preservation and suggesting its upper floors could be used for community arts. After its final screening – The Towering Inferno – the Abbey followed the path of hundreds of redundant cinemas across the UK. Its ground floor became a supermarket, and the circle was later converted into a bingo hall and then a snooker club. The most recent inhabitant, the Co-op, vacated the Abbey in April this year, and it was bought by Lidl a month later. Clare Devaney of Love Wavertree, which organised the petition, said the Abbey’s Beatles heritage and the building itself were of huge significance to the community. “Wavertree has been pretty neglected and there’s been under-investment, but it has a beautiful built heritage. The Abbey has architectural value, cultural value and a Beatles heritage,” she said. In its heyday the Abbey – designed by Sir Alfred Ernest Shennan and opened in 1939 – was illuminated with neon lights. The plush interior included a glass mosaic floor in shades of blue with silver stars, columns, sweeping staircases, walnut panelling and domed ceiling lights. The stalls held 1,126 seats, with another 744 in the circle, which had a licensed bar in its foyer. In Picture Palaces of Liverpool the cinema historian Harold Ackroyd wrote: “The striking main entrance and its semi-circular sweep continue upwards to the apex of the building. The whole bay consists of windows which diminish in height as the structure ascends. These are separated vertically by five columns of black faïence tiles, while grey faïence tiles are used to form the horizontal separation of the windows. The small windows near the roof are styled with Norman arches whose lines are pleasingly carried downwards.” The Cinema Theatre Association, which is supporting the listing application, said the Abbey was “a fine example of the best cinema design of its period, designed by an important Liverpool architect to be worthy of its prominent site in the historic Wavertree village. It formed a key part of the landscape in which at least two of the Beatles grew up, and their references to it give it outstanding national importance.” Another of Shennan’s art deco buildings, the Greenbank Synagogue in Liverpool, built in 1936, was listed in 1983. Ten years ago it was put on the Historic England’s heritage at risk register. Historic England confirmed it had received an application to list the Abbey. Lidl’s plans for the building are uncertain. In response to enquiries from the Wavertree Society, the company said it was “considering all options for the site, which include the potential for a new building of high quality design. Options to retain the building are being explored, but we do need to consider the potential to adapt it to meet Lidl’s operational requirements as well as the structural integrity of the existing building.” It added that the company’s preference was “to erect purpose-built food stores” but it had previously reconfigured existing buildings. Robert Zatz of the Wavertree Society, who saw films at the Abbey as a child, said: “We want to welcome Lidl but we do want to try to preserve something of a building that has a lot of resonance with local people. I don’t think Lidl realises the extent of feeling in the community.” In a statement to the Observer, Lidl said: “While we’re in the process of considering options for the site at Wavertree, we will be consulting with the community and stakeholder organisations throughout the extensive planning process.”"
"Issa Rae, one of the first black women to create and star in a premium cable series and potentially the hardest-working person in Hollywood, is putting in overtime with the aim of having it all. She is Emmy-nominated. She is Golden Globe-nominated. She is a writer, an actor and an executive producer, often all at once. Her hit HBO show, Insecure, which just aired its fourth season, has transformed her into the patron saint of black millennial creatives. She is the black Madonna, adorning endless mood-boards. Fans, black fans specifically, don’t simply watch Insecure, we live-tweet it, we argue about it, we create petitions for it to be extended to one hour, much to the chagrin of its creator. “We sold a half-hour comedy,” Rae tells me when I press her on fan demands for longer episodes, “and I literally have no desire to make an hour show!” A bad Zoom connection means I can’t see her, but I can hear the smile. She is warm, witty, and a total potty-mouth. “Even hearing people say: ‘This is how you can make it an hour, you can do this, you can do that…’ OK, well we don’t want to!” To the uninitiated, the 35-year-old’s rise to the top of Hollywood appears immediate, as though she exploded on to TV screens and into critical acclaim in just a few years. But to fans, her triumphs are long overdue. Next year marks a decade since her break-out comedy web series, The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, debuted. (It ran until 2013, on Rae’s YouTube channel.) Awkward Black Girl was the primordial goop from which Insecure spawned. And for both series Rae mined her misfit youth for stories. She grew up middle class, her father a Senegalese paediatric doctor and her mother a teacher. In childhood, her family moved a great deal, first to the primarily white suburb of Potomac, Maryland, then to Senegal, until they finally settled in LA. Issa was in the sixth grade then – an 11 year old. She was one of the only black girls in her elementary school in Potomac and then the only American girl in her elementary school in Senegal. She struggled to belong in each setting. When she started at a school in LA, attended by predominantly black and Latino students, she found herself the subject of the ballad of many black middle-class teens – “too black for white kids, too white for black kids”. When Tupac died in 1996, she attempted to find common ground with her mourning classmates and mispronounced his name, becoming a social pariah in the process. Before Awkward Black Girl, there was Fly Guys Present the “F” Word, a 2009 YouTube show that followed a goofy group of aspiring rappers, her brother among them. And before that was her first web series, Dorm Diaries, a satirical look at black life at Stanford University in 2007, where she majored in African and African-American studies. A fan of the wry humour of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm,  she was also heavily influenced by black sitcoms like Living Single and Moesha – and it was after attending the set of that latter show in the 1990s she realised she wanted to break into TV. Rae set about creating shows online that spoke directly to black audiences and simultaneously bypassed industry gatekeepers. Awkward Black Girl ran for two seasons and was financed partially by Pharrell Williams, who put season two on his YouTube channel. Rae was at the forefront of the first wave of digital black talent to successfully transition into the mainstream, something she doesn’t consider as crucial today. “People are comfortable with their talents staying online,” she explains. “Back in my day, there was like more of a, ‘Ah man, this should be on TV, this should be a movie’ or whatever, but now it feels like being online is just as viable and just as lucrative.” Not all web series translate to television, but when Rae landed the HBO gig, her profile soared. It is testament to Insecure’s quality that a 30-minute sitcom influences Twitter discourse globally so much of the time. Following the highs and lows of LA-based best friends Issa Dee and Molly Carter, Insecure fosters frank conversation within the black community on a myriad of invisible issues: mental health, bisexuality, open relationships. Yet it is, by Rae’s own admission in a 2016 interview, “a show about regular black people being basic”. Situations aren’t life or death and fans obsess over the messy minutiae of characters’ daily lives. It is radical in its regularness. At the height of season two, in 2017, social media-monitoring tool Brand24 estimated that the show’s accompanying hashtag #insecurehbo had a reach of more than 11 million. “It is a compliment and a burden that people take so much ownership over the show,” Rae says, “because there aren’t a lot of shows about us, so people feel like you have to tell all the stories that can be told, and if you don’t you’re failing us.” After transitioning from our computer screens to our TVs, she is now dominating the silver screen, too. Last year, she starred in body-swap comedy Little and this year, in two romance films: The Photograph, alongside Lakeith Stanfield, and The Lovebirds, with Kumail Nanjiani. She executive-produced both. She remains awkward at heart however, saying she “dreads shoots”, however frequent they’ve become (“I have a shoot right after this call and I don’t enjoy them, so I always have champagne handy!”) This increased visibility, as well as the added complication of sharing a name and face with her character on Insecure, has made privacy a priority. “People have a lot of shit to say and I just don’t want it to be about me, unless it’s talking about my work,” she says. “People fill in the blanks about my own life because of the characters’ choices, but I’m fine with that. As long as it’s not my real shit and it’s wrong then talk away!” This September, she’ll be playing a less relatable, easier to distinguish character – a billionaire’s daughter, in Jay Roach’s socially distanced comedy for HBO comedy, Coastal Elites. “Coastal elites”, the term, is defined by Urban Dictionary as “intellectual, educated, economically advantaged people in states like Washington, Oregon, California”. It follows five characters as they navigate the pandemic and an increasingly polarised political climate. “I actually had never heard the term ‘coastal elite’ until this movie so I’m just like, “What does this mean? Oh OK, it’s me.” Rae and her character, Callie, both live in LA, and they’re both “outraged by the current administration”. “You see so much of the concentrated fuckery of this current president in one place,” she says. “Hopefully you’ll watch the movie and say, ‘This is not normal. I should be upset, I should be outraged.’ Satire or not, we’re living in this and to accept this is to be part of our own destruction.” Coastal Elites is just her most recent project in an ever-expanding list.“Do I get burned out? Hell yeah!” she exclaims. “That was why I took a break last year, because I didn’t really think about how to do everything and do everything well. But it’s not just me – I get a lot of credit, but I work with really great people.” We spend a great deal of the interview talking about others: ensuring that everyone else is paid their dues, past and present, is a big priority for her. In 2014, she founded ColorCreative, an organisation which acts as a springboard for underrepresented writers in TV and film. She was inspired to start the initiative after reading the script of a young woman who is now a writer on Insecure. “Reading that [script] changed my life for the better and it changed hers for the better,” she adds. Last year, she also co-founded a music label, under Atlantic Records, an “audio everywhere company” designed to cultivate exciting new talent and empower independent artists. Whatever the industry, shining a light on black talent is imperative. “Because I’m a fan and because I love to see us win”, she explains. “Because I recognise how much it has shaped me throughout the years. Why would you not? Why would I not?” These community wins appear to slowly be becoming more frequent. In July, 34.3% of the acting nominees for the Emmys were black, and Insecure was nominated for eight, including Rae’s nomination for lead actress. If she wins, she’ll make history as only the second black woman to win in the category since 1981. A shadow is cast on the achievement by the fact that so many who came before her have been historically overlooked, however. It isn’t bittersweet for her, she says. “I don’t even see the sweet in it, really.  I’m not gonna be proud of being the second person, by any means,” she continues. “I was thinking about how so much of the canon of my childhood were black shows and how few of them, even in the best comedy category, have been recognised. I can’t believe Fresh Prince hasn’t won anything or even Family Matters – those shows have shaped, regardless of race, so many US youths and even the world youth. It’s astonishing that our talent hasn’t been recognised in that way, but not surprising.” While diversity within Hollywood increases, it remains a complicated conversation. Increasingly, black, non-American actors such as Cynthia Erivo and Daniel Kaluuya have been condemned for depicting African Americans in films (there was a backlash at British Kaluuya being cast as US revolutionary Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah). It’s a criticism that has been levelled at Rae herself, as well as her co-star Yvonne Orji, despite being raised in the US, since Orji’s parents are Nigerian and Rae is half-Senagalese. What does she make of the growing debate? “It’s just another way to divide us, unfortunately,” she sighs. “Seeing Daniel Kaluuya in that Fred Hampton trailer, I was like, go the fuck ahead! You transformed, you’re an actor! Sometimes I’m pleasantly surprised when I’m watching white shit and I’m like, ‘Oh! The bitch is Australian? That’s so dope! I would have never known.’” It’s these intracommunity battles that affect her most. In 2017 an off-the-cuff remark she made at the Emmys during a red carpet interview went viral after she said she was “rooting for everybody black” at the ceremony. I suggest that it cannot feel particularly good when it seems that everybody black isn’t always rooting for you. “There’s probably nothing that hurts me more than that,” she says. “You don’t want to be a disappointment. I know what it’s like to see Kanye and just be like, ‘Bro what happened?’ Or you know, Stacey Dash [a Trump supporter] like, ‘Girl, I loved you in Clueless – where did we go wrong?’ I want to make us proud and I think that goes to the Denzel of it – there’s just something special about him. He feels like ours, our movie star and he has done right by us.” Perhaps, I suggest, Denzel Washington’s spotless reign comes from the fact his status was cemented in a time before Twitter. “True,” she muses. “I mean, him being in that Julia Roberts movie [The Pelican Brief]?” she laughs. “He would be dragged!” As we gush about Denzel, she speaks about how much she admires his legacy, something that she feels is crucial in a world where 15 minutes of fame is now a near birthright. Sure, her impact is undeniable. But she maintains she hasn’t even scratched the surface of what she hopes her legacy will achieve. “As far as legacy is concerned, I have so much to do,” she says. “And I’m fine with that, but it definitely keeps me up at night. My feet aren’t firmly planted just yet. I’m still walking, I’m still paying my dues, in a way that I’m not mad at. I want to earn being here.”  Insecure series 1-4 are available to watch now on digital Styling by Jason Rembert; hair by Felicia Leatherwood using Lawrence Ray Concepts; makeup by Joanna Simkin for The Wall Group using Fenty Beauty"
"Then Crushingly disappointing follow-upNow Arguably the most influential album of the past 20 years From the moment I heard Da Funk, I was a huge Daft Punk fan, which made their second album all the more baffling. I loved One More Time, but what the hell was the rest of it about? What was with all the cheesy 80s references? Who encouraged them to put that awful heavy metal guitar on Aerodynamic? Why did all the vocals have that ridiculous electronic effect on them? Nineteen years on, every single aspect of Discovery has been pilfered time and time again, from the glossy production style to the sound of the drums. Every vocal in pop has that electronic effect on it, which I now know is called Auto-Tune. Daft Punk were incredibly prescient: play Discovery today and it sounds utterly contemporary. My review, on the other hand, has not aged so well. Alexis Petridis Then Overly cosy 00s knock-offNow Minutely observed and uniquely personal tearjerker When This Country debuted in 2017, I dismissed it as a sedate and sentimental Office tribute act. Besides, I had already filled my decade-ly slot for logically unjustifiable mockumentary with People Just Do Nothing – there was no room for yet another pile-up of delusional nobodies, awkward pauses and infantile bickering. Three years and an avalanche of rave reviews later, I decided I should probably return to Kerry and Kurtan’s spectacularly dull Cotswolds village with an open mind. What I discovered was neither dated nor derivative, but idiosyncratic and deeply specific, full of bizarre quirks and agonising bathos. The final series, which incorporated the death of the creators’ real-life friend and co-star Michael Sleggs, was a masterclass in the consoling powers of comedy. Consider me – very belatedly – schooled. Rachel Aroesti Then Pointlessly twiddly cartoon doom-mongersNow The full stop at the end of metal As a teen Smiths obsessive, I had been a bit of a snob about metal’s neck-breaking, big-shorted charms. That lasted until my late 30s, when I accidentally encountered Slayer at a festival. Within moments of their first howled, blasted, faster-than-hardcore notes, I was like: “Holy mother of SATAN, this is incredible. Why did nobody tell me!?” To their credit, no one replied: “We did. You were busy with Morrissey.” By the end, I’d quite lost the run of myself, clambering over other fans in an attempt to catch a hurled drumstick. I didn’t get it and, in retrospect, I’m glad. In all honesty, I hadn’t remotely earned it. Phil Harrison Then A fame-obsessed charlatan who hid a thin talent behind a big gobNow A hero of our time who paints brilliantly, lives audaciously and expresses agony and ecstasy with guts and genius When Tracey Emin was shortlisted for the Turner prize I found My Bed depressing, but time has proved her seriousness: blurting your secrets at 30 may seem sensationalist, but after 50 it is brave and even profound. I also got to know her and found she is an artist to her bones. I think I was a snob. Now I’m a convert, about to publish my second book about this razor-sharp modern genius. Jonathan Jones Then Twee Gen-Z Pinterest boardNow Delicate unpicker of emotionally complex relationships For a long time, I thought Phoebe Bridgers was an elaborate joke the universe was playing on me. Critics enthused about her tender, sad, beautiful music and darkly funny one-liners; all I could hear was a series of anaemic, one-note songs slathered in an off-putting veneer of irony. It didn’t help that her album Punisher, featuring lines such as “Day off in Kyoto / I got bored at the temple”, was released mid-lockdown. What were they hearing that I wasn’t? I gave up trying, until, suddenly, it clicked: the ghostly vocals slowly unravelling, the lush orchestration, the subtle melodies, the depraved poetry of the lyrics – annoyingly, exactly the kind of gently melancholy music I need these days. Kathryn Bromwich Then Icky high-school comedy that ends up celebrating prettinessNow Hilarious high-school comedy that delivers great laughs What was I thinking? Was I hangry? Did I need a snack? When I watched Mean Girls in 2004, scripted by Tina Fey and starring Lindsay Lohan as the shy, smart student who has to infiltrate a clique of popular classmates, I grumpily tied myself in knots trying to prove it was upholding the very body fascism it was supposed to be criticising. Long after that, due to my 30 Rock addiction, I became a Tina Fey superfan and saw the Mean Girls musical on Broadway, which was a joy. Recently I watched the film again with my wife and 16-year-old son and we all loved it. It’s just enormous fun. Lindsay Lohan and top Mean Girl Rachel McAdams are both great. I should have lightened up. Peter Bradshaw Then Another generic cop showNow A brilliant series about a superhero trapped in a horror movie I was mean about Luther after its first episode. Unenthused about another show about another cop who doesn’t play by the rules, I called it the worst thing I could think of: “Something that Robson Green should star in”. But as the series progressed, it wound itself tighter and tighter, wrapping a story about corruption and murder round the sort of terrifying jump-scares you only see in slasher movies. It was nothing like a generic cop show. It was actually a comic book in disguise. I felt so bad about trashing it that I even printed an apology. Stuart Heritage Then Derivative romcomNow Powerful play about frailty and the joy of human connection I still regret the rather dismissive review I wrote of David Eldridge’s 2017 play. Set in the twilight hours of a house party, Beginning sees a man and women teasingly and tentatively flirt, chat and – the clincher – eat fish fingers together. At the time, I thought it was all a bit predictable. Now I see that it takes real guts and rare insight to write a play as honest, open and seemingly “normal” as this. Sometimes a critic can cherish novelty far too much: more often than not, real life is the most fascinating and complex subject of them all. Miriam Gillinson Then Hilarious and heartbreakingly personalNow An unwatchable gush of mannered quirks At the turn of the millennium, Ally McBeal was event TV in our flatshare: lights off, breaths held, chunky mobiles down. Its celebration of eccentricity, embrace of mental fragility and understanding of loneliness and imposter syndrome – all pitched into a pacy, glossy legal dramedy – changed my view of how mainstream TV could speak directly to my young adulthood in the way music and movies did. Revisited today, it’s still all those things … but the killjoys who said it was unbearably twee and self-conscious, and that the ickle, vulnerable, male-written female lead was a bit dodgy, were right. It’s embarrassing like a florid teenage diary.Jack Seale Then A bloated Marty misfireNow The last of the swaggering crime epics Initially dragged along by the riptide of goodwill for Martin Scorsese’s Boston crime drama (Scorsese! Doing another mob film! With Leo, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson!), I recoiled on rewatching it a decade later. Nicholson’s over-ripe performance, Ray Winstone’s criminally bad Bawston accent, plot holes big enough to drive a truck full of stolen microprocessors through – this was a Marty misfire. But in a weak moment during lockdown I stuck it on, and now I’m a believer once again. No one makes these sorts of operatically overheated crime sagas any more – not even Scorsese (no, The Irishman doesn’t count) – and Damon’s clammy performance as conceited, double-crossing (closeted?) cop Sullivan, remains a career best. Gwilym Mumford Then Oscar-hungry jazz-hands blancmangeNow Armour-piercing love story with bulletproof tunes Even before its accidental announcement took the shine off Moonlight’s historic best picture win at the 2017 Oscars, I found it easy to resent La La Land and its offensively attractive leads. The razzle-dazzle nods to musicals past and knowing winks to Hollywood’s cut-throat present seemed like pandering to self-involved Academy voters. But at some point that punchy soundtrack bopped its way into my brainstem, and the doomed rollercoaster romance between husky starlet Emma Stone and jazz grouch Ryan Gosling suddenly felt affecting, even relatable. So yeah, I got it wrong. No need to make a big song and dance about it. Graeme Virtue Then Just another mindless reality showNow The pinnacle of mindless reality shows Selling Sunset does not, to the untrained eye, seem like a special programme. It is set in the offices of the Oppenheim Group, a luxury real-estate brokerage in LA with celebrity clientele (read: they showed Karamo from Queer Eye a house once). There are lots of female staff who morph into a magic-eye picture of blow-dried hair and tanned skin, while overfamiliar bosses Brett and Jason look like the products of an experiment to fuse Vin Diesel with the Mitchell brothers. And yet, I, and many others, have found it wholly, disgustingly compelling. While the Oppenheim Group prides itself on being a classy outfit, what has made Selling Sunset the reality show of the year is its undignified rows, soapy twists and Christine Quinn – a devious TV villain dressed as Lady Gaga circa 2008. Hannah J Davies Then Overlong, squidgy, coked-up messNow Flawed masterpiece (apart from Magic Pie) “I wrote it on holiday,” Noel Gallagher has said of Oasis’s third LP. “There may have been a small amount of cocaine.” And, my, does it show: every song is a swollen tantrum of back-of-the-fag-packet doggerel, pointless guitar widdlery and songs that just keep going, most lolloping in drunkenly around the six-minute mark. I used to loathe Be Here Now’s lazy, wasted opportunity to complete the perfect triptych. But time’s passage has lent it a certain black-eyed charm: beneath the static and squall the tunes are there, Noel’s nattiness with a hook undiminished. Everything on it sounds utterly enormous. And Liam’s voice has never been more pristine, more righteous. As a snapshot of 90s excess – a bygone age of pig-headed rock-star bravado – it’s a preposterous hoot. Although Magic Pie does remain total, irredeemable codswallop.Luke Holland Then Renegade cop with a massive gunNow Borderline fascist with a massive gun When we were young, the thought of running around town blowing away bad guys was a thrilling and seductive one. Clint Eastwood’s taciturn hero in Don Siegel’s action-packed 1971 thriller gave us a cool role model – and he had a great line in sardonic quips to employ at school (“I know what you’re thinking … ” etc). Today, Harry Callahan’s blithe judge-jury-executioner attitude and the film’s political stance seem deeply problematic: a liberal-baiting defence of extrajudicial police violence embedded in a display of macho posturing. And it gave us Death Wish. Simon Wardell Then A heavy-handed, “wake up sheeple!” political awakeningNow A brilliantly odd peek behind fame’s velvet rope Madonna’s ninth album, a dissection of the American dream in light of 9/11 and the buildup to the Iraq war, was hard to love upon its 2003 release. The title track and lead single was hampered by that rap, in which coffee enemas mingled with shoutouts to her Mini Cooper. But beneath the “money and fame don’t make you happy, guys” sloganeering, American Life offers us a tantalising glimpse at the “real”, unadorned Madonna. The gospel-tinged Nothing Fails and the guitar-led Intervention are glorious, unabashed love songs, while the bonkers Mother and Father lays her childhood trauma bare over splintering electro-pop. Her best album? Maybe. Michael Cragg Then A sitcom-by-numbers that acted as a death-knell for cultureNow At least good enough to watch half an episode of while you eat your dinner As a bristling teen/young adult I thought Friends was an obvious, pandering, saccharine American slushfest that only had six jokes (Joey is stupid! Chandler is sarcastic! Monica is uptight! Rachel is easily flustered! Phoebe is weird! Ross is a horny nerd!) and had one of the most irritating theme tunes in history. But now with hindsight and maturity I realise that Friends deserves its place as the sitcom to end all sitcoms: the cast is immaculate, the joke timing is impeccable. Yes, too many episodes end in someone hugging or falling in love for my taste, but what have we had since? The Big Bang Theory? Ten-season prime-time sitcoms are harder than you think. Friends made it look easy. Joel Golby Then Irritating bid for Britpop-style hipster statusNow Endlessly inventive and brilliantly funny I didn’t actively hate Trainspotting when it came out, but in the British cultural maelstrom of the mid-90s I distrusted it as an irritatingly self-conscious bid for hipster status. But I watched it again a few years later, when the hype was a distant memory – and boy, did I feel like an idiot. Really funny, properly moving and exciting; I couldn’t have been more wrong. Even Ewan McGregor’s total non-resemblance to a late-80s Edinburgh junkie (and having been a student in the city at that time, I’d seen more than a few) failed to annoy me; I could see his star-making performance for what it was. More fool me. Andrew Pulver"
"North Norfolk’s premier broadcaster is no stranger to the world of audio, but he’s really brought the boys out of the barracks in terms of funny one-liners in his latest offering. Steve Coogan’s Partridge shows the world the real, be-slippered Alan as he bravely goes Lynn-free for a week and fuels the rumour that Bryan Ferry can’t ride a bike. 18 episodes Phoebe Robinson was one half of the brilliantly funny 2 Dope Queens; now she turns the tables in this podcast that shuns ubiquitous white male interviewees. Jameela Jamil, Michelle Buteau and a pre-megastardom Lizzo are particular delights, switching effortlessly from seriousness to an eruption of knowing chuckles in their warm chats. 53 episodes MC Grindah and the People Just Do Nothing crew discuss music, fashion, relationships and more in their blundering and inimitable style. Chabuddy G’s “massive fashion interview” is a thing of beauty, just like his nipple-chafing pleather vest. Don’t miss their history of music, starting with classical (“No bass and no drums? You can’t skank to that”). Six episodes Buxton’s ramble-chats might be funny, warm, truthful or sad, but also throw up some of the finest comedy moments in podcastland. One of the best comes an hour and two minutes into episode 29, when Louis Theroux demonstrates his a cappella falsetto of Baccara’s Yes Sir, I Can Boogie. And then goes on slightly longer than is comfortable. 130 episodes The lascivious tale of Belinda Blumenthal flipping her vaginal lid in an ornamental maze is a pioneer of the laugh-out-loud-on-public-transport genre. Jamie Morton, Alice Levine and James Cooper’s dissection of distinctly unerotic dad-penned fiction spawned a world tour and an HBO special. Five seasons A fictional US megachurch lends itself very well to improvised satire in Holly Laurent and Greg Hess’s masterclass of weirdness. With a teen ministry called Climax, a Hamilton-influenced festive episode with a new take on We Three Kings, and some skilful guest stars, it’s joyously disturbing. 104 episodes The Onion’s “true-crime” podcast lampoons the hot dead white girl trope brilliantly. As is tradition in the genre, the police missed a lot of clues so it’s up to David Pascall to investigate when a teenage girl is murdered in the town of Bluff Springs. Plinky-plonk piano, 911 calls and fast-talking waitresses blend with a big dose of absurdity. Eight episodes Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine are Joan and Jericha, agony aunts and purveyors of the world’s funniest and filthiest podcast. Nothing is off limits, from Joan’s weekly smear tests by soft-voiced confidante Mahmood to the sound advice that geriatric mothers risk having wrinkly babies. Sex advice and bobbly boobs abound from a duo equally versed in psycho-genital counselling and sports journalism. Two seasons What started out as relentless rewatching of terrible films spiralled into a source of comfort during lockdown. New Zealand comics Guy Montgomery and Tim Batt spent a year watching Adam Sandler vehicle Grown Ups 2 every week, then Bechdel failure Sex and the City 2, before tackling horror We Are Your Friends. They’re still stuck on Home Alone 3 … 300 episodes A lot of podcasts say they’re unfiltered, but Audrey (AKA Ghana’s finest), Milena and Tolly constantly prove that The Receipts really is. From pole dancing in a fishnet bodysuit to who’s a good white queen (Pink and Reese Witherspoon make the list), it’s all here. And if you send in your question, they’ll dish out advice like the agony aunts they were born to be. 103 episodes, plus bonus: Your Receipts"
"Nonie Chapman has fond memories of Winston Churchill shuffling to the front row of his personal cinema, wearing his monogrammed slippers and a vibrant green one-piece velvet siren suit, and of course smoking a cigar. She was a 21-year-old secretary. He was in the final years of his life. He cut a memorable figure but what she most vividly recalls are his hands. “When his cigar went out a male nurse used to go round and relight it for him and I’ll never forget his amazingly long, artistic fingers … they really struck me.” Chapman was reminiscing to the Guardian in the newly restored secretaries’ room at Churchill’s grand country house Chartwell, in Kent. The restoration of the room is part of a £7.1m National Trust project launched in 2016 to acquire for the nation hundreds of objects and heirlooms, from personal mementoes to gifts from around the world, from the Churchill family. On Friday it was announced that the project had been successful. The objects, which have been on long-term loan to Chartwell, include the Nobel prize for literature given to Churchill in 1953, his wooden speech box and a book signed by every member of parliament, minus Sinn Féin MPs, as a present on his 80th birthday in 1954. Chartwell’s secretaries’ room has been recreated as it was in the 1950s with the help of photos and memories of people who worked there. Chapman is one of those, although she was less a secretary and more a general factotum at the start. “I did anything people wanted me to do … shopping, fetch people from the station, help out in the office.” On a Friday she would take films that the family had watched to the station and collect new ones. “I’d also collect the live bait for the golden orfe,” she recalled. “Sir Winston used to feed the golden orfe.” Chapman said it was a welcoming house and she too was invited to watch Saturday night films in the private cinema. “I remember watching Lawrence of Arabia and what was probably the first James Bond film. They were an amazing family to work for, you could go where you wanted, they were very friendly. The house had a wonderful atmosphere.” After Churchill’s death, she was employed in London as a secretary, driver and companion to his widow, Clementine. The new secretaries’ room has typewriters, telephones, address books and inkwells. On one wall are photographs of important political and military figures including Charles de Gaulle and Field Marshal Montgomery. On another is a map case given to Churchill as a Christmas present by President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1943. Katherine Carter, a senior collections and house manager, said one of the star acquisitions was the Chartwell visitors’ book, which spanned the entire time the Churchills were there from the 1920s to the 1960s. There are lots of family entries but also figures such as Charlie Chaplin, Vivien Leigh, Christabel Pankhurst and President Harry Truman. “It is a real who’s who,” Carter said. A digital version of the book is also now available at Chartwell telling dozens of new stories thanks to the project. “We’ve undertaken a huge amount or research,” said Carter. “There are well over 700 names in the book and when we started, 132 of them had been deemed indecipherable. Now we have all but four. It is a wonderful insight to life here that we never had before … we are so lucky to have volunteer researchers who have devoted thousands of hours to this.” Other acquisitions include a lion sculpture given to Churchill by the people of Luxembourg, which he used to pat on his way to his office; a pair of hairbrushes made from wood from the deck of the second world war ship HMS Exeter; and a miniature paintbox. Chartwell’s gardens have been open over the summer and the house reopens on Monday for people pre-booking tickets. Visitors will also see a dramatic redisplay of Churchill’s art studio with 141 of his paintings. Churchill was famously a gargantuan drinker, enjoying champagne and brandy at lunch and dinner. As he got older he would drink whisky and soda through the day after breakfast, and the art studio nods to that with a decanter of a whisky and soda siphon near his easel. Carter cautioned against judging too harshly, however. “The whisky only just covered the bottom of the glass,” she said. “It was something he began doing in India. He used to call it his mouthwash.”"
"“I’m a Bauhaus-educated chap,” Terence Conran told Vanity Fair last year, before spelling out his philosophy of design, that objects should be “economic, plain, simple and useful”.  On these points he was remarkably consistent: he would have said something very similar at any time in the past seven decades, ever since he was a student at what was then called the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, or even at the design-aware Bryanston School in Dorset. He was, to be more precise, a product of that version of modernism that developed around the Festival of Britain of 1951, on which he had worked. As also expressed in the Victoria and Albert Museum’s influential Britain Can Make It exhibition of 1946, it was the idea that postwar Britain could, with the help of enlightened modern design, both enhance the quality of everyday life and rediscover its ability to make things. The ideals of William Morris, as interpreted by continental modernists, were to be reimported for the good of the nation. The means of this transformation, however, turned out not to be an enlightened socialist state, but the consumer culture of the 1960s, which Conran’s skill and nerve as a businessman turned to his advantage. His most famous achievements were shops – most notably Habitat and later the Conran Shop – and restaurants. His first business venture, The Soup Kitchen, grew out of his experience working in a Paris restaurant, where staff stole steaks by strapping them to their inside legs. It would be harder, was Conran’s thinking, to steal soup. These shops and restaurants really did change the visual and gastronomic culture of the country. It has often and accurately been pointed out that, along with the cookery writer Elizabeth David and the fashion designer Mary Quant, he helped to bring some continentally inspired joie de vivre to what was a drab place. “It is hard to overstate how uninteresting London was then,” he said of his early years in the city, “it really was the era of Spam fritters.” Conran’s most cited achievements include the introduction or popularisation of such things as flat-pack furniture, paper lanterns, duvets, espresso machines and woks. Also the chicken brick, a once-popular terracotta device for cooking poultry. His many restaurants played a leading role in transforming Britain’s reputation as a gastronomic wasteland. If none of these innovations were essential to existence, they could certainly add to the enjoyment of it – Conran’s claim that his promotion of duvets “undoubtedly changed the sex life of Europe” was only partly hyperbolic. Ultimately Conran’s work was about pleasure, about making a sort of tasteful hedonism widespread. His personal life, with four marriages and many affairs, might also be said to have been about pleasure, although with sometimes spectacular divorces and widely reported family tensions that belied the calm of his design aesthetic. If Conran’s core clientele was a certain kind of metropolitan buyer and diner, his influence can be seen in the products of Ikea, in restaurant menus all over the country, in the popularity of what now gets called “contemporary design”. At the same time he never ceased in his ambition to restore British manufacturing greatness through the power of design. To this end he founded and generously supported the Design Museum, founded in 1989 near Tower Bridge and since 2016 located in the former Commonwealth Institute in Kensington. He also supported younger designers, for example giving Thomas Heatherwick his first break when he was straight out of college, the design of a gazebo in the garden of Conran’s country house of Barton Court in Berkshire. Conran the businessman did well in the era of Margaret Thatcher, including through canny property development, but he never accepted her politics. “One of the most odious people who’ve ever walked the earth,” he called her. She, for her part, was outraged that the Design Museum’s displays included objects made by foreigners. Conran found Tony Blair much more congenial, and the feeling was mutual, at least until Conran opposed the invasion of Iraq. He was a prominent representative of Cool Britannia, of the young-at-heart and stylish country that New Labour wished to promote. The Blairs entertained the Clintons at Conran’s Pont de la Tour restaurant. When the French president Jacques Chirac visited for a summit, Conran designed the setting“I’ve seen the fuchsia and it works”, wrote the Daily Telegraph columnist Boris Johnson. Conran never liked the suggestion that he was a businessman more than a designer, claiming that he hadn’t known what “entrepreneur” meant. But it was in bringing modern design to a wider market that his greatest achievements lay. There’s not a Conran chair or a Conran interior that really sticks in the memory, as there were by, say, Charles and Ray Eames or Eileen Grey, and he was never avant-garde. What he did do, though, as he put it, “was to make things available”."
"Photographer Misan Harriman is gently cajoling actor Shaun Parkes as the sun burns through the morning cloud above St Michael’s church in Ladbroke Grove, west London. “Look at me as if you’re searching for redemption,” he says, as Parkes looks down the lens. “But it’s redemption for something you haven’t even done.” Parkes, who rose to prominence as a raver in Human Traffic but now has flecks of grey in his beard, doesn’t ask for more clarity; he simply flashes a look at the camera and then slowly changes pose. Today Parkes and Harriman, who recently shot Vogue’s “Activism Now” September issue, along with portraits of Black Lives Matter protesters, are revisiting the west London area that is the setting of Steve McQueen’s new film, Mangrove. It’s a glorious September morning and, despite the Covid-19 restrictions, the cafes are busy and the flower shops open. It’s hard to imagine that 50 years earlier, a few streets away, there was a pitched battle between the police and protesters that would help change the way Britain thought about race. Parkes plays Frank Crichlow, the real-life figure at the heart of McQueen’s film, which centres on Notting Hill’s Mangrove restaurant and nine West Indians who fought police harassment and then a court case. The look of redemption that Harriman is searching for is something Crichlow and the Mangrove Nine earned the hard way. In the first four films of his career, McQueen has taken on slavery (12 Years A Slave), sex addiction (Shame), the story of Bobby Sands (Hunger) and a remake of a Lynda La Plante heist TV series (Widows). When I catch up with him on the phone, I ask why it has taken him so long to work on a project about the London he grew up in? “Things sometimes need distance and time, and maturity and understanding,” he says. “You grapple with your past. You grapple with things that are so close to you, perhaps more so than things that are seemingly distant. It’s almost under your chin. You need to work it out yourself.” Mangrove has been worth the wait: this is McQueen at the peak of his powers, dedicating his undivided attention to a forgotten moment in British history. That adjective, “British”, is crucial, McQueen says. “It’s essential. You know what’s interesting is that this is important British history, not just black history or West Indian history – this is important English-British history.” Rochenda Sandall, who plays Barbara Beese, a former member of the British Black Panthers and one of the Mangrove Nine, goes further: “It should be part of the curriculum. The only way forward is getting a 360-degree view of everyone’s history in this country. It has been whitewashed for too long.” McQueen wasn’t very familiar with the Mangrove case until recently, despite a family connection to one of the Nine. His father, Philbert, and activist Rhodan Gordon grew up together in Grenada and were close friends. McQueen’s father was a regular at the Mangrove restaurant, and at Gordon’s own Notting Hill restaurant, Back-a-Yard. But even so, McQueen says, the story of the Mangrove case didn’t linger. “It was one of those things that, once it passed, it passed,” he says. “People had so much shit to deal with, it was coming at you every day. It wasn’t something that you harked back to.” This was the era of the “sus” laws, which were disproportionately used against black people, and meant police officers could detain anyone they believed had “intent to commit an arrestable offence”. Meanwhile, the 1971 Immigration Act ended the automatic right of Commonwealth workers to settle in Britain, following the interventions of Enoch Powell, who had been lobbying for a large-scale repatriation scheme for immigrants. The Mangrove restaurant opened in 1968. Crichlow, a Trinidadian entrepreneur, had already opened one other place in London, the El Rio Cafe, which became notorious as one of Christine Keeler and Stephen Ward’s regular hangouts in the aftermath of the Profumo affair. The Mangrove, as Parkes’ Crichlow repeatedly argues in the film, would be different: a restaurant, not a nightspot synonymous with vice. Drugs were banned; waiters wore white uniforms. It became a key meeting place for London’s black community, hosting everyone from intellectuals and activists such as Darcus Howe, Altheia Jones-LeCointe and CLR James, to musicians including Nina Simone, Sammy Davis Jr, Bob Marley, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross and Jimi Hendrix. But its popularity made it a target for west London’s police, who constantly raided the Mangrove, ostensibly to seize drugs that were never found. In the first half of McQueen’s film, the tension builds as “the heavy mob”, a group of officers who patrolled the community like a colonial army, harass and assault black people with impunity. The police raided the Mangrove 12 times between January 1969 and July 1970, and Crichlow became locked in licensing disputes with the local council. In the film, we see Parkes’ Crichlow repeatedly pick up the pieces of his life, and witness his transition from restaurateur to reluctant activist. “It’s about community and the environment Frank Crichlow created for locals, activists, intellectuals and artists,” McQueen says of the film. “He was a hero, even though he didn’t set out to be one.” With encouragement from Howe, Jones-LeCointe and the British Black Panthers, Crichlow eventually staged a protest on Sunday 9 August 1970. In a 1970s documentary, Jones-LeCointe tells an interviewer that the demonstration actively exploded the myth created by the state that black people are “criminals, ponces and prostitutes”. And things did explode. More than 700 officers were on hand for the march, including 588 constables, 84 sergeants, 29 inspectors and four chief inspectors, according to documents unearthed by historian Paul Field. There were also plainclothes policemen and special branch detectives present, for a protest that drew just 150 West Indians from all over London. The plan was to protest outside west London police stations, but things descended into chaos on the residential Portnall Road, which the police claimed was entirely the fault of the protesters. In total, 24 police officers were injured and 19 arrests made. It became front page news, with headlines in the Daily Mirror (“17 Police Injured in a Mob Attack”) and the Daily Mail (“Police Hurt by Black Power Mob”) typical of a media that parroted the official version of events and played into fears about black militants and immigration. Crichlow, Jones-LeCointe and Howe were eventually charged, along with Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis, Barbara Beese, Rothwell Kentish and Godfrey Millett. In 1971, the Mangrove Nine began a 55-day trial at the Old Bailey, accused of incitement to riot, affray and – in some instances – attacking police officers. Jones-LeCointe and Howe decided to represent themselves, a tactic that allowed them to interrogate the state’s witnesses, in effect putting the entire process on trial. Assisted by defence barrister Ian MacDonald, who represented the rest of the Nine, they pulled at each loose thread to expose racial bias. The strategy worked: all nine defendants were acquitted of the main charges of incitement to riot. But what really moved the needle was Judge Edward Clarke’s closing comments. “What this trial has shown is that there is clearly evidence of racial hatred on both sides,” he told the courtroom. It was the first judicial acknowledgment of racism in the Met, three decades before the Macpherson inquiry. In McQueen’s hands, this is an electrifying story. Malachi Kirby (Darcus Howe) plays to the gallery at the Old Bailey, quoting Shakespeare and ridiculing the inconsistent police statements. We see Crichlow being manhandled by court officers and, in one of Mangrove’s most memorable scenes, beating the walls of his cell and shouting about the “savages” who hold him in it. The director and artist’s attention to detail is evident throughout, from a lingering shot of a colander spinning on the floor of the Mangrove kitchen after a raid, to a police officer’s fingernail burrowing into the witness box as his lies unravel. Mica Levi’s scratchy, bass-heavy score adds another layer of tension and paranoia. And in between the harassment and the court case, McQueen shows the West Indian community simply enjoying London life, from street parties to celebrations at the Mangrove. For McQueen, this project is personal. It’s the first of a five-film anthology series created for the BBC called Small Axe, which tells stories from London’s West Indian communities, from the late 60s to the mid-80s. As well as Mangrove, there’s Lovers Rock, which debuted to five-star reviews at the New York film festival, and is based on his auntie’s experiences at West Indian house parties in the 70s. Red, White And Blue stars John Boyega as pioneering black Met officer Leroy Logan, who joined the force in 1983 and became a superintendent at a time when London’s police were condemned as “institutionally racist”. Education focuses on the notorious so-called “schools for the educationally subnormal”, seen as a dumping ground for black children in the 70s, while Alex Wheatle tells the story of a man who grew up in the care system and went on to win the Guardian children’s fiction prize in 2016; Wheatle also worked on Small Axe. McQueen has had a hectic 12 months. As well as Small Axe, there has been a Tate Modern retrospective, plus his Year 3 project, in which he photographed 76,000 London primary school pupils for a show at Tate Britain. He has also made a series of public interventions on race and the creative industries. The last time I spoke to McQueen was in January, after the Baftas once again produced a list of nominations with no people of colour in any of the major acting categories. McQueen was the only one of several major British directors and actors approached by the Guardian who responded, and he didn’t hold back. “After a while you get a bit fed up with it,” he said. “Because if the Baftas are not supporting British talent, if you’re not supporting the people who are making headway in the industry, then I don’t understand what you are there for. If the Baftas wants to be like the Grammys, which is of no interest to anyone, and has no credibility at all, then they should continue on this path,” he added. “If not, then they have to change. Fact.” When McQueen talks about race, his delivery takes on a staccato quality. Sentences are often reduced to one or two words. He is abrupt, and jarringly honest. In June, McQueen wrote an opinion piece for the Observer about his efforts to make Small Axe in the UK with a diverse production team, saying he “could not believe the whiteness of the set” and, “If you want to examine race and class in this country, start by going on a film set.” He wanted the team behind the camera to be reflective of the stories he was telling. “We put a minority person in every single department, and we had four black heads of departments – I needed to have that,” he says now. Why was it so important to him? “How can I put my hands on the camera to start shooting if what’s behind the camera is not reflecting that?” he says matter-of-factly. “I did what I could do, but I didn’t think that was enough.” Small Axe isn’t completely unprecedented in the British film industry. Horace Ové became the first black British film-maker to direct a feature film in 1975, with Pressure, a story about a Trinidadian man in Ladbroke Grove who follows his older brother into the Black Power movement. Franco Rosso’s Babylon (1980) centred on a group of black Londoners in Brixton and Deptford penned in by the police and a racist society. David Koff’s documentary Blacks Britannica and John Akomfrah’s ode to Birmingham’s West Indian community, Handsworth Songs, both tackled similar subject matter. More recently, John Ridley’s Sky drama Guerrilla focused on London’s black 70s radicals – although it was heavily criticised for largely ignoring the black women of the movement. But there is a long gap between the black films of the late 70s and early 80s and today, an absence that looms large for McQueen. “We’ve had two generations of black British film-makers who have been erased,” he says. “Where are the editors? Where are the cinematographers? Where are the costume designers? Where are the designers? Where are the grips? Where are the gaffers?” What is his theory? “Why is the question,” he says, before answering: “People didn’t see the film industry or TV as attractive to them, because it hasn’t been made attractive for them. “But it’s not just behind the scenes; it’s in front of the camera, too. Our Marlon Brandos, our Montgomery Clifts are on building sites or driving buses,” he says. “Our Katharine Hepburns are in IT. They were not welcomed in the British film industry. It might be a bit crazy, but that’s my ambition: to fill that gap.” Despite his own impressive career, McQueen looks around him and sees potential that was never realised. He mentions his cousin Marcus, the subject of his artwork Nov 7th, in which Marcus tells the true story of how he fatally injured his brother while attempting to put the safety catch on a gun. He was not a trained actor, but McQueen says his cousin clearly had talent. “He could have been one of the greatest actors ever,” McQueen says. “I know that. That door wasn’t open to him. People say, ‘Well, he had a choice.’ You think people choose to do shit?” McQueen’s tone has shifted now; the staccato rhythm is coming back. “They don’t choose to go through doors where there’s trouble. If you had a choice, would you want to go for a door that has some kind of future, some kind of stability?” This sense of injustice is what drives McQueen’s work and his interventions. “Sorry,” he says. “I’m rambling on.” Malachi Kirby describes McQueen’s on-set presence as “intense… in a good way”; as a director, he made it clear to the cast that there wasn’t much point in showing up if they weren’t prepared to empty themselves. “Leave it on the pitch” was the footballing maxim McQueen used as shorthand for the fully committed performances he wanted. “There wasn’t any small talk,” Kirby adds. Scenes without dialogue that looked easy in the script would balloon into hours-long improvisations. One such scene, in which Howe delivers a sermon in a Trinidadian church, went from one line of narration to a full day of shooting (“We went from zero to 100, and got very sweaty in a very short space of time,” Kirby says). The scene didn’t even make the final cut. For McQueen, the Mangrove case is symbolic of what the West Indian community put up with, and fought against to cement their place in Britain. “You know the only reason I’m talking to you today is because of them,” he says, referring to the rarity of a black journalist interviewing a black director. “West Indians and what they did, by coming and paving the way for so many things to happen, for so many people, should be championed and celebrated.” The Mangrove Nine would go on to have varied lives. Howe became a broadcaster and columnist for the New Statesman, gaining more notoriety towards the end of his life when a BBC anchor suggested in a live interview that he was “not a stranger to riots”. Howe’s response went viral. “I have never taken part in a single riot, I have been on demonstrations that ended up in a conflict,” he said. “Have some respect for an old West Indian negro, and stop accusing me of being a rioter.” He died in 2017, after decades fighting for the rights of black Britons. Crichlow closed the Mangrove in 1992 after years of disputes with the authorities. The same year, he sued the Met for false imprisonment, battery and malicious prosecution. The police eventually paid him a record £50,000; he died in 2010, aged 78. Rothwell Kentish faced a separate prosecution after the Mangrove case, and was sentenced to 36 months for assault and possession of an offensive weapon. He died last year, aged 87. Rhodan Gordon turned Back-a-Yard into a Black People’s Information Centre, helping to defend housing tenants facing discrimination. He died in Grenada in 2018. Beese became a writer, while Jones-LeCointe, who came to London to complete a PhD in biochemistry, influenced a new generation of black activists, including Linton Kwesi Johnson who joined the cause after seeing her in a debate. Beese and Jones-LeCointe are the only surviving members of the Mangrove Nine; both have been invited to the film’s premiere at the London film festival on 7 October. The rest of the Small Axe films will go out at prime time on BBC One later this year. This is the first time a black historical drama with the heft of an Oscar-winner behind it has gone out in that slot, and McQueen knows it. “From day one, that was my priority. I wanted BBC One. I want my mum to see these pictures,” he says. “I want people to have access to it, and the BBC is the only way to do that. It is important because these are national stories. These are stories that helped to make the fabric of this country.” Is he worried about them becoming politicised, used as another stick with which to beat the BBC? After all, if the mere suggestion that a conductor supports Black Lives Matter can cause one of the biggest culture war moments of the year, what will a drama about black radicals who call the police “pigs” going out at prime time do? McQueen pauses and slowly repeats the phrase “culture war” before answering. “For me, it’s a moral situation. The thing about the Mangrove Nine is they were on the right side of history; so people have to decide what side of history they want to be on,” he says. “They were persecuted for the colour of their skin, they were persecuted because of their race. This is a celebration of justice. It is a celebration of self-determination, and it is a celebration of Britishness.” These five films are, in McQueen’s words, a “first port of call”. He wants to continue the series and go beyond the capital, to tell black British stories from Bristol, Manchester and Liverpool. “There are amazing stories that haven’t been told: national stories of the black community in those areas that I want to explore,” he says. “I’m interested in Liverpool because that was a place where the first, the largest black community was in the beginning. It’s about these amazing narratives of how black British people succeeded in other parts of the country.” The title of Small Axe comes from the Caribbean proverb, “If you are the big tree, we are the small axe”, made popular after Bob Marley used it as a lyric on the Wailers’ 1973 album Burnin’, followed by the line “ready to cut you down”. It’s a defiant statement in the face of terrible odds, and in Mangrove, McQueen has created his own redemption song. "
"As the political fallout from the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg continued to roil Washington, Democrats “still held a shred of hope that they could persuade four moderate GOP senators to show some integrity and stick to their principles” in not voting on a nominee with just six weeks until a national election, said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. After all, Senate Republicans refused to vote on Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, with nine months to spare in 2016, citing the need for the people’s input in an election year. That hope “lasted almost a full day and a half,” reported Noah, as Utah senator Mitt Romney confirmed on Tuesday that he would “follow the constitution and precedent” and vote for Trump’s nominee “based upon their qualifications”. Many hoped otherwise, said Noah, as Romney is “the dad you ask when your other Republican dads say no,” but “people always forget that Mitt Romney is still a conservative senator from one of the most conservative states.” Securing a conservative majority on the supreme court is a longtime conservative dream, Noah explained, and joked that “on his bedroom wall growing up, Romney had a poster of Superman, a dancing horse, and an empty supreme court seat.” With the votes for a nominee a virtual lock and no avenues to prevent a confirmation, Democratic leadership vowed to seek revenge; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, told reporters Mitch McConnell should know that “he is playing with fire”. “But let’s be honest: knowing what we know about Democrats, ain’t shit going to happen,” said Noah. “When Democrats say ‘everything is on the table,’ then watch out, Republicans – you’re about to get a sternly worded email.” “There’s a Christmas in the air, leaves are changing, our nation is ravaged by a preventable disease due to our president’s criminal negligence,” said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show’s first episode of the fall season, on a day when America passed yet another grim pandemic milestone. Over 200,000 Americans have now died from the coronavirus, a toll higher than the battlefield deaths of its last five wars combined. And yet, the handling of the virus continues to be marked by confusion and political obfuscation. On Friday, the CDC updated its coronavirus information page with an addendum that “airborne particles can remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others, and travel distances beyond six feet”. “Kind of important information just to slip in there on a Friday afternoon,” Colbert deadpanned. “Hey, uh, you guys, no biggie, but the virus is airborne, six feet won’t save you, so you’re gonna want to wrap yourself in saran wrap and start a new life under the floor boards.” But on Tuesday, the CDC quietly removed the information, claiming it was just a “draft version” that was “posted in error.” “Well, that’s not comforting,” said Colbert. “That’s like a fire marshal saying, ‘if you catch fire, remember: just stop, drop, and ignore everything I just said.’” The CDC claimed the extra-airborne guidance was an “honest mistake,” but “I think we should take everything the CDC says with a grain of salt for the foreseeable future,” said Colbert, since Trump appointees delayed one CDC study for weeks because it showed the actual number of coronavirus infections was ten times the official number, and thus in “conflict” with Trump messaging. “So they’re trying to change reality just to fit what the president says,” Colbert added, “which explains why the CDC says the new recommended serving size for food is bucket.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel returned to the studio after a summer off from late-night to recap the bitterly contested rush by Republicans to place a conservative on the supreme court, despite blocking Democrats’ efforts to do so in 2016. Trump is “moving very quickly on this,” said Kimmel, “but when it came to doing something about the virus that he knew was deadly – a virus that has now killed over 200,000 of the Americans he swore an oath to protect – then he moves slower than Eric doing the People magazine crossword puzzle.” On Monday, Trump told a crowd in Ohio that the coronavirus effects “virtually nobody” – which is “insane,” said Kimmel, as is the inexplicable CDC revision of its own guidelines on airborne virus particles. To recap: on Friday, the CDC posted a warning on its website that droplets could remain suspended in air and travel more than six feet, “which was a big deal,” said Kimmel, “because even though we knew this, this was the first time a government website admitted it.” But on Tuesday, the droplets paragraph was replaced with a correction that claimed a “draft version” was “posted in error” to the website. “In other words: oops, we accidentally posted the truth, sorry,” Kimmel explained."
"With a specially baked cake from Mary Berry and a blue plaque in her honour on her favourite work chair, Dame Jenni Murray acknowledged that it felt “very, very strange” to be hosting her final edition of Woman’s Hour after 33 years.  Murray, the BBC Radio 4 show’s longest serving host, took up her post in September 1987 and ended her tenure on Thursday, played out by Helen Reddy’s anthem I Am Woman. Ending her broadcast, Murray said she had to consistently remind herself that women are a “vast range” and there are “many, many, many different stereotypes that fit our gender, so there is no one stereotypical woman. But our sex, we share.” She was joined live on the show by Labour politician Harriet Harman, barrister Helena Kennedy, theatre director Jude Kelly and writer Jackie Kay, all of whom paid warm tribute. Harman said they were all from the first generation of women to say they were not going to choose between staying at home or prioritising going out to work, but would do both. “That was an incredible, huge social and economic revolution which was invisible to most of the broadcasting world,” said Harman. “But Woman’s Hour, with you right at the heart of it, you made the space for all of these issues to be discussed day in, day out.” Without that space, the progress that has been made would never have come about, Harman said. “You leave a tremendous legacy and I want to really thank you for that.” Kay said she saluted Murray for “holding a mirror up to the real world and everything that’s been going on in that … and to the imaginative world and the cultural world.” Kelly said Murray was not just a “national treasure”, but an international one – the programme has fans as far afield as Japan. Lady Kennedy pointed to the issue of marital rape, which Murray and Woman’s Hour shone light on. “By giving public space for a debate … it actually ignited the shift that took place. By putting it on air, organisations like the Women’s Institute then invited me to go and speak … Women started making the demand for change. I think it was about being well informed.” Murray told her guests that she preferred a solid chair to one that wiggles around. “It’s green and it’s been here for years. The studio managers have put a blue plaque on it: ‘Jenni Murray last sat on this chair on 1 October 2020’.” The programme included a collection of her best moments over 33 years, revealing how Murray never shied from tricky questions. There were snippets of her interviews with Hillary Clinton (“What is it about Bill that has enabled you to forgive his infidelities?”) and Edwina Currie (“How supportive to women can you call yourself when you have put Norma Major’s private life into the public sphere?”). Within weeks of joining the programme, Murray interviewed Bette Davis, then in her 80s. The actor had a fearsome reputation, but Murray won her over, even managing to persuade her to deliver her line from All About Eve: “Fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a bumpy night.” One of her most regularly terrifying interviewees was Margaret Thatcher, she said. Not so terrified that Murray did not bring up how François Mitterand waxed lyrical about Thatcher’s Marilyn Monroe lips and Alan Clark was attracted to her ankles. “Did you play on that? Did you flirt if you had to?” Murray asked. “I didn’t even know they had made these comments,” Thatcher replied, looking aghast. “How should I?” Murray said she was baffled by the reply, but later realised that Thatcher’s press secretary, Bernard Ingham, would never have dreamed of ever telling her these things had been said. The “peak of her career” was telling Joan Baez that her favourite song was Diamonds and Rust, and being delighted as Baez performed it there and then. It left her “sobbing inside because she was so wonderful”, she said.  Barnsley-born Murray joined the BBC in 1973, working first for BBC Radio Bristol. After spells on BBC South Today, Newsnight and the Today programme, she became a regular presenter of Woman’s Hour in 1987. Her colleague Jane Garvey has also announced that she is stepping down from presenting duties, in her case after 13 years. Radio 5 Live’s Emma Barnett will take over in the new year."
"If you’re craving a zombie series that ditches the cynicism and has some good old-fashioned fun with the idea, then allow me to introduce you to Zomboat!, a short, six-episode British comedy with a silly title but a surprisingly clever premise. The series follows sisters Kat and Jo (Leah Brotherhead and Crazyhead’s Cara Theobold) after they wake up one Sunday to find Birmingham under attack by zombies. As a gamer nerd who knows her zombie lore, Kat already has a plan for this scenario – steal a canal boat and escape to Eel Pie Island in London, because zombies can’t swim. And, as Kat puts it, “The Walking Dead would have been over in one season if Rick Grimes had gone to the Everglades.” After stealing said canal boat, the sisters find two stowaways in the bathroom: misanthropic Sunny (Hamza Jeetooa) and his sensitive gym bro buddy Amar (Ryan McKen), who are stranded in the city after a stag weekend. Though they clash at first, the group decides to team up for survival, leading to plenty of bickering, bonding and snogs. As a result, the series avoids falling into the same style-over-substance trap that spoiled other recent zombie comedies (like Netflix’s Daybreak); instead, it benefits from the kind of found-family warmth that made Zombieland so charming. That’s not to say there isn’t action. If you think fleeing zombies on a tiny, slow-moving canal boat might create some unusual challenges, you would be right. For a start, there are 166 canal locks between Birmingham and London, the water can drain without warning and the toilet on the boat doesn’t cope well with poo. Zomboat! doesn’t keep its characters confined to the boat for long, allowing each episode to introduce a seemingly trivial problem that forces everyone back on land. Comparisons with fellow British zom-com Shaun of the Dead are fair: Zomboat! creators Adam Miller and Will Hartley were heavily inspired by the film’s meta brand of humour. But while the set-up of their show isn’t exactly original, it’s fun to watch this ragtag group quip their way through classic zombie movie scenarios – such as a poorly guarded government evacuation centre – because the stakes aren’t particularly high and their behaviour is unpredictable enough to keep you guessing. They also never feel like genre stereotypes, just real people reacting absurdly to an absurd situation (which is all too believable these days). It would be easy to let Kat, as the most self-aware character, do nothing more than poke fun at zombie tropes, but Zomboat! subverts that cliché by making reality fall short of her expectations. At first the solitary nerd relishes her chance to lead the group through a real apocalypse with her knowledge from movies and games, but it turns out leather pants chafe and zombie blood will ruin a perfectly good cup of tea. In one especially entertaining episode, Jo is left covered in zombie goo and spends the whole runtime trying to find a hot shower, which is frankly the most relatable behaviour I’ve ever seen in a zombie story. If lockdown has taught us anything, it’s that we’re desperate to hold onto our little comforts in the face of chaos. Zomboat! might deal with the end of the world, but it’s a wacky, fantasy version of the apocalypse that I for one have sorely missed, especially now that The Walking Dead’s nihilistic approach has become expected in the genre. As harmless escapism goes, it’s the perfect three-hour binge."
"Bridget Christie: I could watch her for hours. She’s one of the reasons I became a comedian in the first place. As a proud Yorkshire lass, I’ve got to say the Four Yorkshiremen from At Last the 1948 Show.  Billy Connolly’s Tall Tales and Wee Stories, a collection of his most famous routines written down. He truly is the master. Victoria Wood’s Dinnerladies is just exceptionally written; every single line is a setup or a punchline.  My nana, Lavinia Forrest: she’s funny because she doesn’t know she’s funny. My grandad will hate this answer because he likes to think he’s the funny one in the family. As a disabled comedian, often my hecklers are also disabled. Once I was heckled for an entire hour by a seemingly lovely woman with a speech box … so she had to type her heckle out before playing it. That’s effort, and I respect her for that. I pride myself on being excellent at fancy dress, and I have dressed up as Ronald McDonald, Lady Gaga, a Christmas pudding and a crocodile to name but a few. But I think my funniest outfit was a fully inflatable Mr Blobby costume. Have you ever seen a five-foot lady with cerebral palsy wobbling towards you dressed as Mr Blobby? It was quite something. My walk. Let’s clarify this: you’re not allowed to laugh at my walk but I am. Most times I am in control of my leggies, but occasionally they have a mind of their own, and the little flicks can be very funny. “Utch”. It’s a northern word that means: “Move your big bum, I want to sit on the sofa.” I remember moving to London and friends being baffled when I’d wave at them, shouting: “Oi, utch up love!” Makes me proud to be a northern bird.

"As news broke last week that Universal Studios Group will soon shoot three major TV series in Queensland, adding to a slate of international productions promising to bring jobs to a besieged local industry, many urged caution. “The majority of employment in the Australian sector is not on Hollywood blockbusters made for international audiences but on Australian film and television telling Australian stories to Australian audiences,” the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance says.  Still, those Hollywood blockbusters are hammering at our door. “Of course they all want to work here!” actor and director Rachel Griffiths says. “We look like a miracle.” At the suggestion that the pandemic might yet have a silver lining for the local screen industry, Claire Tonkin, head of drama at Australian film and television production company, CJZ, says: “Well, it’s been a heck of a cloud!” In April, grim estimates from the Guardian projected 20,000 job losses in the Australian screen industry. Screen production ground to a shuddering halt around the world. But as many Australian states started to gain local control of the virus, and with some having been effectively Covid-free for months, international producers have turned to Australia as they scramble to find safe havens to make new product. They are the gatekeepers of a colossal global market for film and TV production. According to figures from creative industries strategy consultancy, Olsberg/SPI, global spending on screen production reached $250bn in 2019, with 14m jobs created. The federal government’s $400m location incentive boost announced in July specifically targeted international productions with the aim of attracting some of this swag. And it appears to be working. “It’s been phenomenal,” says Kate Marks, CEO of Ausfilm. “Since April, when it became clear we were getting on top of the virus, and after the Location Incentive was announced, we’ve had $2.7bn in inquiries from international productions.” Screen agencies across the country, from Western Australia to northern New South Wales, are also reporting record requests from around the world. Although it’s impossible to gauge how many of those queries will bear fruit, a tally of the 11 major international film and television productions either in production, or slated to start shooting soon, paints a healthy outlook for the local industry. Combined estimates show an injection of just over $1bn into the sector, with almost 18,500 jobs generated by projects including Marvel’s Thor: Love and Thunder and Paramount’s Shantaram. Those figures seem likely to grow, with major projects involving actor Liam Neeson and director Ron Howard rumoured to be on the way. But the good news comes with a caveat. Producer and founder of production company CJZ, Nick Murray, called out the shortcomings of the location incentive system in an opinion piece published in the Sydney Morning Herald: “The new scheme stuffs cash into the pockets of the studios on the false premise that helping the foreign productions is of benefit to the local sector. It isn’t.” If the Location Incentive is a carrot to attract international investment, quotas that force free-to-air and subscription television to produce Australian content are the stick that protects Australia’s unique screen culture, though streaming services have so far been exempt, and the question of whether this ought to continue has been hotly debated. Those quotas were suspended in April after Covid-19 halted Australian screen production. On Tuesday, the government announced their reinstatement from 1 January but with changes that have left the industry fuming, including dropping the quota on children’s television for free-to-air TV and continuing to leave the streamers exempt. Screen Producers Australia CEO Matthew Deane, described the announcement as a “backward step” that threatens to halve the amount of local content being made, and wipe out thousands of jobs. According to the MEAA, film and television content under Australian creative control is worth about $5.3bn a year, and generates 30,000 jobs, dwarfing the international contribution to the local industry. To defend local content, the Australian screen industry has presented a united front since 2017 through the Make It Australian campaign, stating: “Our ability to keep telling Australian stories on screen is at risk, and our voices in danger of being drowned out by a deluge of overseas content.” They point to the European Union quota system, where at least 30% of content carried by streaming platforms must come from the region. Murray wants the same rules to apply in Australia. Some industry players see prospects for all parties to productively coexist. Tony Ayres, an award-winning Australian director, showrunner and writer who co-founded Matchbox Pictures and launched his own production company in 2018, is a staunch advocate for Australian voices. “A country’s national identity is defined, in part, by the stories that we tell about ourselves,” Ayres says. But he doesn’t see the need for friction between local and international productions, calling it “a symbiotic relationship” where “each feeds off the other”. In the meantime, others are just happy to see jobs on the horizon. Griffiths envisions a promising way forward. “One key element is finding ways to collaborate on an international level to support our fantastic local storytellers to keep telling stories that have meaning for us.”"
"Tuesday night’s presidential debate was, by most accounts, an off-the-rails train wreck, one quickly trashed by late-night hosts. “Usually when you see two guys this age arguing, it’s about leaves being blown on to each other’s lawns,” said Jimmy Fallon of the 90-minute spectacle which pitted Donald Trump against Joe Biden, both in their 70s, for what turned into an incoherent, sinister mess. The president interrupted Biden to the point of incoherence and talked over the moderator, Fox News’s Chris Wallace. There were few coherent sentences to process, and even less substance. “Seriously, did anyone take anything away from tonight?” the Tonight Show host wondered. “Was that helpful to any American? The only person who enjoyed that was Vladimir Putin while he was stroking a cat. “Honestly, sitting through that debate felt like getting a Covid test in both nostrils at once,” Fallon added. The spectacle in Cleveland, Ohio, did, Fallon joked, make history in that it “was the first time Americans ever watched something on TV and wished there were commercials”. Fallon also panned Wallace’s performance as moderator, in which he failed to cut Trump off, enforce rules or maintain control. “Before the debate, Chris Wallace said if he did his job right, it would be like he’s not there. Well, mission accomplished,” Fallon joked, comparing Wallace’s performance to watching “a kindergarten teacher running a class on Zoom”. “First things first, we need new debate rules, people,” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. “Chris Wallace, thank you for your service, and I hope that you have a lot of money for your therapy, you made a valiant effort, but you were not ready for this. Because no human being could’ve been ready for this. They don’t need a moderator for this thing, they need a UFC ref. “Moderators, you need to figure out how to handle Trump at a debate, because this is not good for the nation,” he added. Noah jokingly proposed more effective strategies to keep Trump from interrupting, such as using a spray bottle on his hair or offering him $100 for every sentence he lets Biden finish, since “money is a great incentive for him, and now that we’ve seen the tax returns, we know that he needs it”. “Whoever decided on this format needs to be fired,” Noah added. “I have never, and I mean never, wanted to see a commercial break more badly in my life.” Why, Noah asked in disbelief, were there no factcheckers? “Otherwise people can just stand on the stage and say whatever they want, and there are no consequences. Zero, nada, zilch. Every time a candidate says a lie, there should be some kind of sign that they lied. “It’s like the NBA Finals and all of a sudden you can call your own fouls. No! That’s chaos – you need an actual ref on the court, people.” So what was his takeaway from the debate? Noah shrugged. What was there to say? “I don’t know how Biden did, because Trump did more interrupting than Kanye West in a room full of Taylor Swifts,” he said. “It sounded less like a debate and more like the radio was stuck catching two stations.” “I come to you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, an empty vessel,” said Stephen Colbert following the debate, for which he found the term “shitshow” to be an inadequate descriptor – “both an insult to shows and to the other word that I can’t say because this is CBS”. The Late Show host zoomed in on “one of the most telling, one of the most upsetting moments not only of the night but of my lifetime”, which was “when the president of the United States was asked simply to condemn white supremacy”. Trump instead sputtered: “I’m willing to do anything, I want to see peace,” and “Give me a name, who do you want me to name?” When Wallace answered “white supremacists” as Biden supplied the Proud Boys, a men-only, far-right extremist group, Trump responded: “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.” “Didn’t do it!” Colbert fumed, then imitated the president: “I don’t support white supremacists, I just command them, like a dog, that’s why I’ve got this shiny dogwhistle.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel lamented a “terrible” first debate. “I’d call it a nightmare,” he said, “but at least during a nightmare you get some sleep. “Because of the pandemic, there’s no opening handshake tonight; there’s no physical contact,” Kimmel explained of the Covid-era’s strange set-up. “The candidates remained socially distant the whole time. It was like date night with Melania.” That was about the only restraint shown by the president; “they flipped a coin to determine who would get the first question, but when Trump saw the quarter in the air he said, ‘Hey, that’s how much I paid in taxes last year,’ and it went downhill from there,” Kimmel joked. The “debate” veered so far into chaos, largely thanks to Trump’s ceaseless interruption, that Wallace had to repeatedly call attention to the task at hand. That’s how you know it’s bad, Kimmel concluded. “You know things are getting heated when the moderator pleads, ‘Please, gentlemen, let’s return to the topic of race.’”"

My nan knitted my school jumpers, bless her. They were the right colour but a bit wonky and handmade. A bit like Mickey Mouse on an ice-cream van: all the elements were there, just a bit off. I was having dinner for the first time at an ex-boyfriend’s parents’ house. They’d never catered for a vegetarian before, and I sat down to some plain spaghetti with a tin of baked beans poured on top. I thought it was adorable – they’d tried.  A disastrous perm when I was 11, just in time for my mum’s wedding. I looked like Little Bo Peep crossed with Margaret Thatcher. Nothing is less funny than hearing people’s funny dreams, is it? I’ve had more laughs hearing people describe their surgeries. Falling over. My biggest performing fear is stacking it on my way to the microphone, because you can’t recover from that.

"In 1990-91 Tim Renton came closer than any other arts minister to funding England’s regional arts boards directly from the ministry’s budget, so exasperated was he at the re-centralising cravings of Arts Council England.

"A debate about the lack of diversity in Australian musical theatre has resulted in the cancellation of a $50,000 scholarship amid disputed allegations of bullying and intimidation. The 2020 Rob Guest Endowment, a lucrative professional development program for musical theatre, was cancelled late last week, with organisers saying they were concerned for the “mental health and welfare” of the prize’s 30 semifinalists, alleging that the latter had experienced “bullying and intimidation” as a consequence of a recent outcry about their apparent lack of diversity. But the semifinalists have roundly rejected claims that they are the victims of bullying, instead saying that after weeks of negotiation with prize organisers, they had been planning to withdraw from the competition en masse, before the endowment beat them to the punch by announcing its cancellation. The dispute follows weeks of tense discussions about diversity and inclusion between the endowment leadership committee, the semifinalists and the performers’ union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA). Complaints erupted in August around the prize’s semifinalist announcement, with many observers noting the chosen 30 performers appeared to be uniformly white. In response to the backlash, the endowment organisers said they “clearly [needed] to work harder at encouraging entrants from the BIPOC [black, Indigenous and people of colour] community”. At the time, the 30 semifinalists said they stood in solidarity with artists and performers who were people of colour. “We are uniting to listen, learn and actively be part of the solution,” they said in a joint statement. The endowment released a statement last Wednesday in which the leadership committee apologised for its “omissions and failures” in the 2020 competition, saying it had sought guidance from “industry leaders” to ensure the program was “inclusive, safe and welcoming”. The statement listed a number of strategies the endowment was proposing to implement, including diversity quotas for its leadership board, judging panels and finalist selections, as well as allowing prize entrants to self-identify by ethnicity. “It became clear that given the progress so far, the best path forward would be to continue to work with and support the current semi-finalists, while working to bring significant and exciting change to future years,” the statement said. Two days later, the organisers cancelled the 2020 prize entirely. The endowment said on Friday afternoon it was calling off the competition and suspending its scholarship grant until 2022 “to protect” the semifinalists, saying the latter had been “targeted and intimidated from a number of sources and as a result have experienced significant anxiety over recent weeks”. The finalists, however, rejected the endowment’s claim that they were bullied. “We categorically refute any claim or insinuation made by the endowment, or any others, that the competition had to be cancelled in order to protect us from bullying and/or intimidation,” they said in a joint statement on Sunday, released through the MEAA. The semifinalists said they had, from the outset, sought assistance from the diversity committee of the MEAA’s Equity branch, the arm of the union that represents performers. Following those discussions “and through our own volition”, the semifinalists said, they had decided to withdraw from the competition en masse, “to prevent our colleagues from further trauma, to de-centre ourselves and to amplify the First Nations and POC voices”. “The endowment’s reactive cancellation prevented us from enacting this step,” they said. “We fervently denounce the actions of the endowment, including but not limited to silencing POC and First Nations voices, misrepresenting us and our stance on the matter, and the lack of transparency that has occurred from within the endowment.” The endowment had been involved in negotiations with the semifinalists, the Equity diversity committee and other members of the performing arts community since 20 August, the union said in a separate statement on Sunday.  A log of claims, which the union said had been created from “discussion with over 100 vested stakeholders” and which detailed changes the industry had hoped to see in the prize, had been presented to the endowment on 2 September. Further claims had been put to the endowment last week, after its proposed actions fell short of what the performers’ coalition had hoped for. “It is disappointing that the time, lived experiences, and wealth of knowledge and skills that were volunteered by the [equity diversity committee], our members and our wider industry has been mislabeled as ‘bullying’ and ‘intimidation’,” the union said. “It’s concerning to see the endowment rob the semi-finalists of the commendable agency we’ve witnessed over the past month, to silence their voices and co-opt them in a narrative they were not part, let alone aware of. This work should not be discounted or invalidated, but engaged with.” The Rob Guest Endowment declined to comment."
" As labours of love go, the French label Naïve’s Vivaldi edition, begun in 2000 and now notching up some 60 titles, takes some beating. The opera Il Tamerlano, performed by the Accademia Bizantina and directed by Ottavio Dantone, is the latest in the series, starring the baritone Bruno Taddia as Bajazet (by which name the 1735 tragedy is also known), countertenor Filippo Mineccia as Tamerlano and contralto Delphine Galou as Asteria. Mezzo-soprano Sophie Rennert (Irene) has the work’s best-known number, Sposa son disprezzata, in which she bemoans her fate as a spurned bride. Taddia puts high energy into his agitated Dov’è la figlia (Where is my daughter?), the strings of the Accademia Bizantina lithe and spirited in their busy accompaniment. Vivaldi wrote some of the arias, borrowing from elsewhere for others in the habit of the day. Performance standards are high, and even when interest dips a bit the three acts rattle along in high style.  Kicking off with a bang and full of bawdy humour, Malcolm Arnold’s The Dancing Master, Op 34 (Resonus), performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra and soloists in this world-premiere recording, conducted by John Andrews, has been neglected like so much of the composer’s music. This 1952 farce, commissioned by the BBC but rejected for being too racy, is full of double entendres and mistaken identity, as befits a piece inspired by a Restoration comedy: nothing to frighten today’s audiences, and full of melody and the vivid orchestration that made Arnold, among other things, such a skilful composer for cinema. A lively cast – Eleanor Dennis, Catherine Carby, Fiona Kimm, Ed Lyon, Mark Wilde, Graeme Broadbent – enunciate every word crisply. Andrews keeps the pace brisk, capturing the wit and making a persuasive case for this 75-minute work. Arnold has his advocate: his star may be rising.  Forty voices raised in song: Tallis’s Spem in Alium and a world premiere by James MacMillan, Vidi aquam, livestreamed from Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, are free to watch online, with Byrd’s Ave Verum and Ave Verum Corpus, beautifully reimagined by Roderick Williams.

"Making this list made me realise there have been way too many funny things I’ve received from the internet. It was really difficult to choose just 10 from the multitude that came to mind. Perhaps this realisation should have sent me into a spiral about how much time I spend online, but really, that kind of crisis is just so 2019. Anyway I hope these make you laugh. And if they don’t, it’s okay. We’re all different people with hugely varying, equally valid world views and that’s what makes the world such a beautiful, dynamic, super divided, polarised and ill-equipped to fight climate change place! It’s really hard to choose a favourite Clickhole article but Give Me Kiss is not just one of the funniest pieces of writing online, but I think one of the funniest things I’ve read ever? It’s hard and unimportant to say what Give Me Kiss is exactly. It’s probably best to call it a love letter that begins, “Hello, spouse. This is your spouse. I have a special message for you on this, our ninth anniversary. The special message is this: Give me kiss.” And it just ... escalates from there. Like Shakespeare, Give Me Kiss does things to the English language that haven’t been done before. Except it’s much funnier than Shakespeare. Honestly, people should abandon his sonnets and read Give Me Kiss at their weddings. A singer with an impressive vocal range covers pop songs as Toad from Mario – this is everything that’s good about the internet. While every Toad Sings cover is a hilarious screech into the void, Chandelier is the first one I heard, and still has me laughing. I’ve also been singing along lately – and it’s a big cathartic 2020 mood. There’s nothing I can say about Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared except that it’s mind-bending, hilarious and perfect. If you need more information, Wiki says it’s a “surreal comedy web-series” that parodies “children’s TV” and includes “psychedelic content and imagery involving gore and psychological horror”. What a dream!! (I just read the team behind Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared have been developing a TV show for years that’s getting a release soon. We are saved!) The Lord of the Rings (LoTR) universe feels like a crucial part of early online comedy culture – maybe because it’s uniquely ripe for jokes, or maybe because the films came out when a generation of kids were getting ready to hook their brains to the internet forever. Whatever the reason, it’s still going strong and you have to respect that (also I was that kid who put their name into an Elvish name generator so just let me have this okay). Of the many memes, Alright Then, Keep Your Secrets is one of my favourites: endlessly versatile, sometimes political, always instinctually ridiculous – I mean, just look at Frodo’s shit-eating smile. Special mentions go out to other legendary LoTR comedy bits online like Ian McKellen’s Gandalf scene on Extras and Cassie Claire’s very silly LoTR fanfic diaries. Oh what was my Elvish name you (absolutely didn’t) ask? I couldn’t say. I must... keep my secret. If you’ve never read Kate Beaton’s comic series Hark! A Vagrant, you now have the next week of your life sorted. Often history based, always super smart and silly, Beaton’s illustrations are genius and have made me cry-laugh many times. Straw Feminists is one of the greats. The internet loves the trashy camp of reality TV. While there are endless memes from The Real Housewives franchise, including the legendary woman yelling at cat, to choose from, “Pooja, what is this behaviour?” has my heart forever. “Pooja, what is this behaviour?” started as a clip from Bigg Boss (the Indian version of Big Brother). From the coincidental jazz caused by Pooja kicking a bin, to her brazen defiance – “I kicked it by mistake” – to Pooja’s inspired choice to switch accents (what is that accent? Cockney? High vamp? Pooja™?) while yelling, “You’re asking for it! You’re dying for it!” at someone who’s clearly doing nothing of the sort – every beat is a masterpiece. The video first gained traction among parts of the South Asian internet, but now it’s everywhere, in endless gifs, TikToks, and as shorthand for when you just need to ask, what is this behaviour? Chris Fleming is a kind of fae goblin whose videos have a particularly online quality. Often featuring a lo-fi score, and uh, “interesting” body language, his sketches somehow distil cultural neuroses into horribly funny and hysterical truth, which is my favourite type of truth. This is the first Early/Berlant video I saw and it caused me to die on the spot. When I got to hell, I wouldn’t stop talking about the video so they returned me to earth. Yes it’s another Chris (just as strange), and another comics artist, but Chris (Simpsons artist) deserves his own entry. Chris’s images feel like non-sequiturs written by a disturbed child that nevertheless make a desperate funny sense. They’re viscerally weird, a bit gross and liable to haunt your days. Enjoy. They’re animals but they’re CHONKY. Chonky animal accounts have really taken off in the last couple of years and I’m not sure why. However, I am obsessed. I want to hold all the animals and also I can’t stop laughing every time I see them.

"Hundreds of civic museums in towns and cities across England are in a state of high jeopardy and some may never reopen without government action, museum leaders have said. They say organisations face an existential threat at a time when they could be playing a pivotal role in “reawakening and reimagining” town and city centres. Consultations on large-scale redundancies have already been announced by museum trusts in Birmingham and York. Local authorities, often the main funder of civic museums, have said their finances are in a potentially perilous state, with at least five English councils suggesting they may not be able to balance their budgets. In a joint statement, the English Civic Museums Network, the Museums Association and the National Museum Directors’ Council call on the government to extend the cultural recovery fund into 2021-22 and to provide funding settlements for councils that enable them to invest in museums. Tony Butler, the director of Derby Museums Trust, said museums were most worried about the next financial year. “Talk to any local government funding chief and they will say there are big problems ahead.” He said museums and galleries knew from bitter experience of government austerity policies that they are among the first to suffer when cuts have to be made. In early July Derby was one of the first city museums to reopen after lockdown. “We saw our role as being in the vanguard of reactivating the city centre,” said Butler. “In the future, there will be a further decline in retail in town and city centres and in its place leisure and culture will play a much bigger role in attracting people. Once we’re through this, there is a huge potential for museums to play their part in regeneration.” Derby Museum and Art Gallery has the world’s finest and largest collection of works by Joseph Wright of Derby, paintings that can currently be enjoyed in relative quiet. “There are some real treasures in our museum and they help us understand our place in the world when life is in such flux,” said Butler. Civic museums are predicting an average 81% drop in commercial profits and 66% fall in donations this year. Sharon Heal, the director of the Museums Association, said she was “deeply concerned” that some museums will not be able to reopen after lockdown. “We are already hearing of major local authorities that are considering not funding their museums and galleries because they are non-statutory services,” she said. “Museums are vital civic spaces and can play a critical role in rebuilding and recovery with their communities – but they need funding to be able to do that.” Ian Blatchford, the director of the Science Museum Group and chair of the National Museums Directors’ Council, said: “Civic museums have already weathered brutal cuts to their services over the last 10 years, adapting their business models to find alternative sources of funding, but the current crisis means they are being pushed to the limit. “This government has already committed to supporting our towns and regions, so investing in museums, a core part of our civic infrastructure, is a key way of ensuring that people everywhere can benefit.” Museum funding is becoming an increasingly political issue. Over the weekend it emerged that the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, had written to the directors of all government-funded museums and galleries warning them not to remove statues or other artefacts as a result of pressure from campaigners. In the letter, leaked to the Sunday Telegraph, he said it was imperative that publicly funded bodies acted impartially, particularly as the Treasury embarked on a “challenging” review of all Whitehall spending."
"A teenager rides her placid black horse through the countryside, dropping off bundles of books to the town’s children. It’s a wholesome scene reminiscent of a 19th century novel, except it’s 2020 and this book delivery service is helping a small bookstore stay in business during a pandemic. Squishy Minnie is a much-loved children’s bookstore located in the Macedon Ranges town of Kyneton, Victoria. Using horsepower to deliver books was just one way the bookstore’s owners, local couple Kristen Proud and Lakshal “Lucky” Perera, kept the community entertained when it had to close its doors. The store closed sooner than most: Proud, who has a masters in international health, watched the virus escalate around the world and concluded that the federal government wasn’t acting fast enough. She closed the bookshop in mid-March before lockdown restrictions were introduced. “I was in the shop watching kids touch everything and I could feel my anxiety rising. Our space encourages touching and interaction. I thought to myself ‘if any one of these people has Covid, we’re screwed’,” says Proud. But with that decision came a different kind of apprehension. Proud and Perera knew their bookshop was important to the families in the area, and they were concerned about the knock-on effects that closing might have. “We didn’t want to lose our connection to the community because we had to close our doors,” says Proud. So they set about a different way of operating. The junior staff had lost their storefront shifts, so Proud came up with creative ways to keep them busy. Fifteen-year-old Sam delivered books on his pushbike, while 17-year-old Alice saddled up to complete book deliveries with her beloved horse, Argo. “Kids loved it. People put in orders just so they could get a horseback delivery. It really brought joy to the community during a challenging time,” says Proud. The store’s strong social media following resulted in online orders coming in from all over Australia, with staff adding further personal touches to deliveries by including handwritten notes and complimentary nasturtium seeds for home gardens. When panic buying emptied supermarket shelves, a free roll of toilet paper was added to postal orders upon request, thanks to Proud fortuitously ordering a year’s supply before the pandemic. This sense of community spirit had also led Proud and Perera to set up the town’s first street library for children’s books earlier in the year, built in collaboration with the Kyneton Men’s Shed. Its book clubs moved online. A grant from the local community house also enabled them to host additional online writing and illustration workshops for kids. But no event was as important to maintain for Squishy Minnie as story time, a weekly institution looked forward to by adults and children alike. Before Covid-19, the store would heave with excited, fidgety little bodies all bursting to see resident storyteller and music-maker Perera in action. Once closed, storytime was swiftly moved online, with special guests injecting some variety into the lives of families locked down during a long, cold (seemingly never-ending) Victorian winter. A dog-themed story time recently featured the couple’s cute-as-a-button groodle, Helix, while Logie award-winning actor and writer Miranda Tapsell and Kyneton-based screenwriter Joshua Tyler celebrated the release of their co-written illustrated book Aunty’s Wedding with a special reading on Zoom. “We opened Squishy Minnie because we wanted regional kids and young adults to have access to exceptional books and resources. We focus on books that reflect the society we live in, such as literature written by First Nations authors and books that have characters from a variety of cultural backgrounds,” says Proud, who adds that story-time sessions have also been held in Spanish and Auslan. The store recently hosted Boonwurrung elder Aunty Fay Muir and co-author Sue Lawson in an online reading of their new book Respect, produced by Indigenous-owned and led publishing house, Magabala Books. But it’s Perera who has become something of a local star in the community as a result of his regular story-time duties. “I absolutely love doing story time. It’s one of the highlights of my week. The happiness and excitement on the faces of the little folks each time I see them is joyous,” he says. As a Sri Lankan Australian living in a region that’s home to a predominantly white population, Perera believes his presence helps to encourage inclusivity. “There is a real benefit for me doing story time and being a visible presence at Squishy Minnie. It’s helping to advance tolerance and understanding in our region’s young folks,” he says. “I jokingly tell everyone that I’m a celebrity in the under-four demographic. It’s rare for me to be able to go out without a little person waving, smiling or saying hello to me.” The store celebrated Love Your Bookshop Day on 3 October with an online story-time extravaganza over Zoom starring 13 authors including Briony Stewart, Zeno Sworder and Maree McCarthy Yoelu. With restrictions recently easing in regional Victoria, Squishy Minnie has tentatively reopened to a limited number of masked, sanitised book browsers. Despite the challenges of running an independent bookstore in a regional area during lockdown, Proud has seen many positives spring from what has been a diabolical year. “The community has really rallied to show us support,” she says. “People have actively chosen to buy from us and send us uplifting messages on social media. Covid-19 has emphasised that the community is invested in our survival. I wouldn’t have necessarily known that otherwise. It’s pretty amazing.”"
"Actor Patsy Ferran was born in Valencia in 1989 and studied drama and theatre arts at Birmingham University before going to Rada. She graduated in 2014 and made her West End debut in that same year playing Edith, in Blithe Spirit and Jim in Treasure Island at the National Theatre. She recently played Honey in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? on Broadway, and has also appeared in various TV shows and films including God’s Own Country. Last year she won best actress at the Olivier and the Critics’ Circle theatre awards. She was in A Christmas Carol at the Bridge theatre until it was forced to close last week. Ferran plays Sister Blanche in Black Narcissus, which begins on BBC One on 27 December.  Weather by Jenny Offill Lockdown was an interesting experience because it reignited my love of reading in full force. This is one that still sticks in the brain. Loads of local bookshops were celebrating it. It’s the kind of book that has its own table. It follows this woman who is a librarian, and due to her occupation, she is very much an observer of life. The main theme is the state of the planet, dealing with climate change, living in a divisive world, potentially exhausting subjects, but she does it with a sense of humour. I tend to annotate parts of books that I like, and my copy is full of sticky tabs. Scrooge (Brian Desmond Hurst, 1951) I watched it out of duty, as prep for this job I’m doing at the moment. I was so pleasantly moved and surprised. It’s just gorgeous. It’s so well shot and so well told. The actor who plays Scrooge, Alastair Sim, is wonderful in it. I felt like a kid again watching it. I prejudged, and thought it was going to feel dated, but it works and his performance is joyous and so good. My boyfriend was away on another job, and I kept filming scenes on my laptop and sending them to him. It made me want to look into other films from that era I might have overlooked. The Terrell Show YouTube is my weakness. I absolutely adore Terrell Grice. He hosts a show in his house and has a signature blue wall which he and his guests talk in front of. He loves music, soul, R&B, gospel. He invites a singer on, nine times out of 10 with an extraordinary voice, and they play a game called song association. He gives them a word, and they have to sing a song with the word in. The two episodes I love are with Cynthia Erivo and Stout. Grice is so gorgeous and charming. You just have to watch him react. Lots of positivity and talent. Backlisted It’s hosted by two lovely men called John Mitchinson and Andy Miller. They are both ex-booksellers. One of them is now an author and the other is the publisher of Unbound. They invite a mate on who has a favourite book that has either been overlooked in the past, or is from a famous author but less known. I heard about it during the first lockdown and it saved my soul a little bit. With all of this uncertainty, there can be a lot of negativity. It was such a change. I found it alien to hear three or four people generously talk about something. They trained their brains into reading something that might not be their cup of tea, but always find something good to say about it Selling Sunset (Netflix) British TV is very wholesome, like The Great British Bake Off or Strictly Come Dancing, but that doesn’t do it for me. I need American and shiny, and Selling Sunset ticked all the boxes. It’s about estate agents in Hollywood selling the gazillion-dollar mansions to rich people. They wear the most ridiculously high heels, tight skirts and have the most insane cars. It’s also about the dynamic between these six women in the office who love to hate each other. I’m half out the closet when it comes to my love of reality TV shows. Le Relais de Venise l’Entrecôte in Marylebone, London I live about a 20-minute walk away from this famous French steak restaurant. There’s always a queue, even pre-lockdown. The one thing you can order on the menu for delivery is La Baguette. It’s a gorgeous big piece of baguette, stuffed with steak that’s been chopped up, french fries and a sauce. I’ve been living nearby for 10 years and I always thought I should go. I had a birthday recently, and decided to order it. It was sensational. My boyfriend and I shared it. Every mouthful was an eye-roll of pleasure. It’s not cheap, but if there’s a special occasion…"
"On Tuesday evening the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, promised “jobs, jobs and jobs” and signalled a new fiscal strategy – one that for the first time was not focused on budget surplus. The arts sector dared to imagine this could mean increased support targeted at the hardest-hit, job-rich sectors with the most spare capacity. The added incentive of close to zero interest rates gave us hope for extra stimulus to fill the hole in the arts and culture sector left by Covid-19. Disappointingly, Tuesday’s budget speech provided yet another blow to a sector that is already struggling to survive the pandemic. The cultural and creative sector contributes $111.7bn to Australia’s economy (based on figures for 2016-17). But, since coming to power in 2013, Liberal-National Coalition governments have repeatedly delivered budgets that lack meaningful and substantial funding for arts and culture. It is important to acknowledge the aspects of the budget that have the potential to trickle down to artists and organisations indirectly: commitments to improved mental health support, the youth employment initiative, business asset write-offs, individual tax cuts, and increased assistance for artists living with disabilities, through the NDIS. This is where the extent of the potential impacts on the arts sector ends. The creative industries were ignored altogether in Frydenberg’s budget speech. Increases to the funding of national cultural institutions, where they have been granted, are so small as to be entirely meaningless once adjusted for inflation. Research from the Australia Institute shows that every million dollars invested in the arts creates nine jobs. In construction, that same investment generates just 0.9 to 1.3 jobs. Rather than investing in sectors with the greatest potential to support jobs and the return to work, the budget has instead committed to indirect job creation. The government has provided unprecedented support for private business, a decision that relies on the assumption and hope that businesses will retain and hire new staff amid an economic crisis. The budget commitments demonstrate the Morrison government’s lack of interest in redressing the debilitating impacts of Covid-19 on the arts sector. Despite the arts sector being the first and worst hit sector, and likely the last to recover, the budget fails to provide a roadmap for the sector based on bold, strategic vision and long-term recovery. The $250m committed this year – none of which has been spent – will do little to rebuild the arts sector, which is already weakened by exclusions from existing income support measures, cuts to local content quotas for Australian TV, and the increase of arts and humanities degree fees. The income tax cuts package will benefit high-income earners the most – and for longer – with a permanent $2,430 cut. Lower-income and middle-income earners (between $48,000 and $90,000) will receive a $1,080 tax cut for just one year. These cuts will have little to no impact on most artists, whose average income for their creative work alone is well below the poverty line: a mere $18,100, according to research by Australia Council for the Arts. Urgent investment in the arts has been ignored despite clear, consistent and united calls from the sector. The National Association for the Visual Arts’ submission before the budget was clear about what was needed to redress the long-term decline in funding that is damaging the arts industry, and making it harder for artists to sustain careers. We outlined the need for strategic investment to address the sector’s structural challenges concerning declines in artists’ incomes and career prospects, and worsening prospects for organisations’ sustainability. Calls for additional investment in the arts – $25m a year for the Australia Council and $2.5m a year for the regional arts fund – have also been ignored, when both have consistently been advocated by industry leaders and major cultural institutions including Regional Arts Australia. Moreover, the budget neglects the preferences of the majority of Australians (63% of us) who believe that arts and culture should be financially supported. The arts, alongside hospitality and tourism, will remain significant contributors to the economy after the pandemic and these sectors should not be left to falter without adequate government support during it. Those anxious about being left behind as jobkeeper and other Covid-19 supplements phase back will join the thousands of artists and arts workers who have disproportionately been excluded from the wage subsidy. The budget, even more so in times of a recession, should inspire confidence vital for post-pandemic recovery. The 2020-21 budget has highlighted the urgent need for a creative roadmap to restore and grow the sector, maximise its cultural and economic impact, and inspire confidence in our next generation of artists, audiences and critical thinkers to create our future."
"June Sarpong has only been drunk precisely once. She was 20, working for Arista Records, and had helped organise the launch party for Janet Jackson’s 1997 album, The Velvet Rope. “Everyone was there –the Spice Girls. Naomi Campbell.” Sipping on a cup of hot water and lemon on a canalside terrace, she lets out a tickled “Whew!” at the recollection. Several tequila slammers and some pink champagne later, she pinballed home, woke up the next day “with zero hangover” and decided there and then that booze wasn’t for her. “But parties, I like. The Janet one is still one of the best I went to.” When pressed, Sarpong will admit that a do at Elton John’s mansion, a fashion party in Monaco with Hollywood A-listers, Ibiza’s Manumission in its live sex-show heyday and a charity event with Bono all rank fairly high on the list. “Wild,” she says, eyebrows raised but gossipy secrets sealed. “I’m an enabler,” she jokes. “I ply friends with alcohol when they come over, I just don’t participate.” Does she not get bored hanging out with drunk people? “In our industry? No! I’m used to it. Who isn’t drunk? The only people I notice are the ones who are sober,” she says, her glorious cartoon cackle let loose. For a particular generation, Sarpong’s laugh – an irresistible elastic giggle once described as “a celebratory roar that makes you imagine party poppers and champagne corks” – is etched in distant memory. Along with an obsessive lip gloss habit, it became her trademark when interviewing pop stars and confused-looking celebrities on MTV and T4, Channel 4’s weekend youth strand. Then, ironically, Sarpong’s languid, flirty delivery had viewers accuse her of being drunk as she and co-star Vernon Kay larked about on live TV. But she has never needed booze to be merry – a fact that probably helped when she began getting called on to do jobs that demanded hard work and squeaky-clean credentials: days of unprecedented access to Tony Blair for a documentary when he was prime minister; a gig presenting Nelson Mandela’s 90th birthday; being a tireless ambassador of the Prince’s Trust; as the face of the Make Poverty History campaign. At the beginning of her career she dated David Lammy (they split in 2003 and remain good friends), but she made lasting friendships across the Labour Party while hosting pop shows on telly. Now she is the author of three books – we’re meeting to discuss her third, The Power of Privilege, a smart and digestible manual on how white people can challenge racism – of the kind endorsed by Desmond Tutu and Kofi Annan. Last year the BBC headhunted her to become its creative director of diversity. It’s a huge job, albeit part-time for three days a week, that inserts itself in commissioning departments and channels across the board to try to achieve the BBC’s pledge that 20% of its workforce come from diverse backgrounds. In an organisation of 27,000 employees, Sarpong’s brief can’t be easy. “Well, we know that if you look at who’s had access to opportunity across the board, it’s been a very, very small group in society,” she says. “In order to reverse that and jumpstart the system, you have to intervene. People are very comfortable with targets and goals in all areas of business; it’s only when you start talking about targets for people that there is debate. But I’m not wasting time or energy with anyone who doesn’t want to do it. Especially when there are lots of people who do. My focus is there.” On the morning we meet, the actor Laurence Fox, a vocal critic of the BBC, has announced he is setting up a new political party to “reclaim” British values. The news comes days after Andrew Neil announces he is leaving the BBC to set up his own right-leaning opinionated 24-hour news channel, akin to Fox News. Does Sarpong worry that the “debate” is set to become that much more toxic and divisive? “I can’t speak on behalf of either of them, but I would tell you something: Andrew [Neil] is one of the most inclusive people in this industry, in terms of who he hires and promotes and champions. A lot of black people in the industry would agree. I don’t know what he’s doing with his news channel, but we do need to keep having sophisticated, nuanced conversations.” Sarpong waves a hand at the morally absolute framing of villains and heroes. “It’s too binary,” she says. “And life isn’t binary. We don’t allow people to be fully formed humans. The biggest misconception about me is that I’m ditsy. And sometimes you can be ditsy, but that does not mean you can’t be serious, methodical and strategic.” It’s worth remembering that Sarpong really was a rarity in the industry when she started out as a young, black woman fronting mainstream British TV. There were nicks made to her self-esteem and credibility along the way, but she always seemed to wear it lightly. When she joined MTV at 21, for instance, part of a new wave of female presenters including Cat Deeley, Edith Bowman and Donna Air, Sarpong was excluded from a magazine cover shoot celebrating the station’s hot new female talent. At the time, she shrugged it off. “The worst was that it wasn’t the magazine that had made the decision – it was MTV,” she says now. But she kept her head down and stuck to the immigrant parent script: you have to work twice as hard for half as much. Sarpong was born in east London in 1977 to Ghanian parents. The family, including her older brother Sam, moved back to Ghana when she was two to live a comfortably upper-middle-class life. Following the coup of 1981, the Sarpongs fled the country and ended up in a council estate in Walthamstow. Her parents divorced by the time she was seven; her father and Sam moved to the US and set up home there, while her mother worked as a nurse, remarried, and stayed in London with her three daughters. Sarpong said she “got on with everybody at school – the popular kids, the misfits, the geeks before they became cool,” but suffered a horrific car accident in her mid-teens and was immobile for two years. It didn’t dim her focus. “I turned up to my first job at Kiss FM in a neck brace,” she says, fondly name-checking Trevor Nelson as one of her first champions. “I wouldn’t be here without a lot of people who helped me and looked out for me along the way. That’s why it’s so important to keep paying it forward.” From Kiss FM onwards, Sarpong’s career seemed to rocket. At the height of her fame, she became a character on Bo’ Selecta! and Ricky Gervais wrote her into an episode of Extras. “I went as far as I could go here,” she says, her hand miming the ceiling. “I was committed to television, I wanted to be like Davina McCall. But what we call ‘shiny-floor shows’ [Saturday-night family TV shows] weren’t available to me.” By the end of 2007, like her peers Dermot O’Leary and Russell Brand, Sarpong had grown up and out of the youth TV she had come up with. She was awarded an MBE, called it quits on T4 and like plenty of black British talent before and after her, moved to the US. “I remember meeting with one particular senior executive for a more adult-focused documentary. A mandate had come on high from the boss to have me on board, but the executive couldn’t get past her preconceived ideas of who she thought I was. I was never patronised more in my life. My agent was furious. I just thought, ‘You know what, I don’t want to start doubting myself and my ability, my worth and value.’” In New York, Sarpong jumped in and expanded her wheelhouse: she became a businesswoman and co-founded WIE (Women: Inspiration and Enterprise) and put on conferences with the likes of Sheryl Sandberg and Arianna Huffington. She stayed for eight years before coming home and immediately joining the board of the Remain campaign. “That dinner [the night of the vote] with George Osborne and Peter Mandelson, when the results started coming in…” She lets out an exaggerated exhale. “Woooh, I gave up the ghost early. I left after Sunderland was called.” You can see why Sarpong is as well- connected and effective as she is, whether it’s presenting The Pledge on Sky News, a topical panel show with rightwing motormouths, such as Nick Ferrari, or being called on to sort out the Beeb. At 43, she values being able to understand and get on with people she fundamentally disagrees with in order to win rare, incremental, shifts in their perspectives. She’s not asking for a radical dismantling of the system, but aims to work within it. “I believe when life gives you lemons, you make lucrative lemonade. I love the younger generation; they’re not taking anything. They call me Aunty. I love it.” She laughs again. “We’re doing lots to level the playing field for them, but it’s not the same – it’s not. And sometimes we do our young people a disservice by making them think it is, because when they do come up against that kind of systemic racism, that systemic inequality, they are crushed by it.” Underneath her intensely likable effervescence, Sarpong is resolutely steely. It is curious how much she takes on – even her current CV lists a collection of board memberships and charity work – without feeling overwhelmed. Would she want another go at primetime TV? “I’m happy dabbling! I do The Pledge, I did a bit of Loose Women. It’s fun, but there is so much talent out there, I’m more excited about bringing the next generation through. I’ve done it.” Plus, she insists, “I think I’m better at listening than I am at talking,” which is saying something because Sarpong is a champion of chat. Not just easy, breezy nattering – the kind that gifted her the nonstop presenting jobs in her 20s and turns our one interview into two – but big, instead of small talk. “People often want to tell me their whole life story. Sometimes I’ll be sat at a dinner next to someone telling me things they’ve never told anyone else before. It happens a lot.” A lack of showbiz ego and an innate warmth on her part helps; the photo grapher and stylists melt when she starts gabbing. She’s a born butterfly. “If I hadn’t become a television presenter,” she says, “I’d probably be a therapist.” The surprising thing for anyone who remembers her best for creasing up while flirting with Jamie Foxx (“He’s quite a fruity guy, let’s just put it that way”) or taking Kanye West for a haircut (“Musical genius, but the worst: I never want to interview him again”), is how poised Sarpong 2.0 is. Everyone grows up, even if they were once the Tinkerbell of T4. And Sarpong has weathered her share of knocks. In 2015, Sarpong’s older brother, a seemingly happy and successful US model and actor, took his own life in California. Sam Sarpong Jr didn’t drink or do drugs, and had no known medical history of mental-health problems. The family was devastated; her father became a shell of his former self and June moved back to London, holding on hard to her Christian faith to get through the grief. “I’ve been through a lot of… I’ve had some shit in my life and I don’t want to go into it, but I’ve had some terrible times. And when you’ve been through that, you are grateful for an uneventful day, waking up happy, alive and healthy.” It’s a perspective that makes lockdown entirely bearable for her. If having to figure out five different video-meeting platforms in a day is as bad as it gets, she says she has little to complain about.  “I didn’t and I don’t have the luxury of being mediocre, or the luxury of people assuming my opinion is valid because of the package I come in,” she says, matter of factly. “I’ve always been doubted – I didn’t go to university, I’m not Oxbridge-educated, but I never allowed that to bother me, because I’ve never believed that is the only sign of intelligence. What I do know is that if somebody has hired me – even if they consider it the diversity hire – I know when I get there that I can do the job. I’m not doubtful.” The Power of Privilege by June Sarpong, is out now HQ £5). Buy a copy for £4.65 at guardianbookshop.com.

"More than 400 heritage sites in England, from the Blyth Tall Ship in Northumberland to Bodmin Jail Museum in Cornwall, are to receive money from a £103m rescue fund to help them through the coronavirus crisis. On Friday the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, announced long-awaited details of the first major tranche of funding from the government’s £1.57bn culture recovery fund. It includes £67m to 433 organisations who applied for grants of less than £1m each to help them survive the pandemic. Another £34m will go towards restarting stalled construction and maintenance works at major heritage sites. A further £2m has been awarded to the Architectural Heritage Fund. The money is from the Treasury, but decisions on who gets what were made by Historic England and the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The fund’s chief executive, Ros Kerslake, said the government support was crucial, but added: “Our heritage is still facing a perilous future – we are not out of the woods yet.” It was right that investing in heritage was a priority, she said. “Heritage creates jobs and economic prosperity, is a major driver for tourism and makes our towns, cities and rural areas better places to live. All of this is so important for our wellbeing and will be particularly vital when we start to emerge from this incredibly difficult time.” Details of the fund were announced on the same day that 1,300 job cuts at the National Trust were announced. The charity said it had more than halved the number of compulsory redundancies it had expected to make as a result of the coronavirus crisis, but 782 people had taken voluntary redundancy and 514 people would be made compulsorily redundant after the biggest redundancy consultation process in its 125-year history. Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said it was heartening to see money going to sites and organisations that had been hit hard by coronavirus. “These grants range from giving skilled craft workers the chance to keep their trades alive to helping heritage organisations pay the bills,” he said. They would also kickstart repairs “at our best-loved historic sites”. He said: “The funding is an essential lifeline for our heritage and the people who work tirelessly to conserve it for us all, so that we can hand it on to future generations.” The grants include money to sites that often draw tourists because of their links to film and television. Highclere Castle, famous for being the setting of Downton Abbey, gets £72,000; Gloucester Cathedral, whose cloisters were used as Hogwarts, gets £200,000; and Wentworth Woodhouse, a vast Georgian mansion in Rotherham that doubled as Buckingham Palace in the film Darkest Hour, gets £468,300. The recipients include smaller, quirkier places that would be a big loss to the cultural fabric. For example, the Shell Grotto in Margate, a strange place that is either a Victorian folly or an ancient temple, depending on who you talk to. It put in a bid with Margate Caves and receives £48,200. The grotto’s owner, Sarah Vickery, told the Guardian that being closed from March to July had been incredibly tough. “We lost an awful lot of income. To be honest, so much I’ve not wanted to add it up … you’ve got to preserve your sanity.” Despite that, Vickery said she had never given up. “The grotto has been open to the public since 1838, it will take more than this to close it. We were always going to find a way through, although I wasn’t sure what that would be for a long time.” The government money may not sound a lot but she said for them, a “micro-attraction”, it was an important lifeline. “It’s really great. It basically means we can stay open all the way through winter.” Nearly 20 cathedrals will receive chunks of money, including Canterbury (£999,200), Winchester (£948,200), Wells, (£201,300) and Salisbury (£245,000). Other recipients include the International Bomber Command Centre in Lincolnshire (£426,700), Blyth Tall Ship (£51,400), the Piece Hall in Halifax (£995,000), Blackpool’s Winter Gardens (£846,600) and the Severn Valley Railway in Worcestershire (£906,000). The £34m heritage stimulus fund will be divided out to 12 heritage organisations including the National Trust (£6m), the Canal & River Trust (£1.6m) and Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), which looks after buildings including the Tower of London and Hampton Court Palace. HRP receives just over £3m. Lucy Worsley, its chief curator, said the organisation would now be able to resume critical conservation work. “There’s no truer way to experience the past than to walk in the footsteps who have lived it,” she said. “That’s why preserving our heritage is so important.” Dowden said: “As a nation it is essential that we preserve our heritage and celebrate and learn from our past. This massive support package will protect our shared heritage for future generations, save jobs and help us prepare for a cultural bounce back post-Covid.” Heritage leaders have welcomed the news that money from the cultural recovery package will finally start flowing. Arts organisations including theatres, museums, galleries and music venues are still waiting to hear if they have been successful in getting critical rescue money. Those announcements are expected early next week."
"You’ll remember the skulls, if nothing else. Even if you weren’t one of the 1.23 million people who attended the National Gallery of Victoria’s inaugural Triennial in 2017, you will have seen Ron Mueck’s colossal installation, Mass: enormous piles of oversized skulls scattered across a gallery space and dutifully Instagrammed by every attendee with a smartphone. The NGV’s second Triennial – which the gallery announced on Thursday will open on 19 December – is slated to be of much the same scale as its first. Eighty-six projects from more than 100 artists from around the world will grace the spaces of the cavernous St Kilda Road premises, and the organisation is hoping that after eight months in lockdown Melburnians will be keen to get out and see it – and placing a heavy bet on the hopes that they will be able to get out at all. Assuming they can, they’ll get to see artworks from the likes of Jeff Koons, Tony Albert, JR, Faye Toogood, Dhambit Mununggurr, Kengo Kuma and many more from across the globe. But that won’t be possible until Victoria reaches the “last stage” of its Covid recovery roadmap, when there have been zero new cases in the community for more than 14 days – a situation the gallery (and everyone else) is hoping will happen before the Triennial opens. Managing an exhibition of this scale is no small feat in ordinary times, but the pandemic – and the state government’s stringent lockdown restrictions caused by Victoria’s second wave – has added an extraordinary extra layer of complexity to the production. In some ways the gallery was lucky: the first wave broke at the opposite end of the year to the scheduled opening of the project that has been three years in the making, meaning it was possible to envision it could still happen on schedule, while other projects were necessarily either shelved or kicked down the road. That didn’t mean that the exhibition could stay the same.  “Artists have changed or adapted some projects in light of the things that have happened,” says Don Heron, NGV’s assistant director of exhibition management and design. It’s his job to oversee the Triennial’s logistics: the design of the spaces, the installation of the works, and actually getting the art to Melbourne in the first place. “We had to revisit how [those pieces] might work, how audiences might interact with them, how much space is required for them to work effectively.” The Los Angeles-based Japanese artist Misaki Kawai, for example, had been commissioned to create an interactive piece for the children’s gallery featuring large, shaggy dog sculptures, a puppet-making studio and recording booths for puppet performances – an incredibly tactile work that required some rethinking. “We had to move from a hands-on mode to a hands-free mode,” says Heron. NGV’s multimedia team collaborated with Kawai’s studio to turn, for example, touch-screen elements into foot-activated trigger mats on the floor. Instead of punching your details into a computer screen, QR codes will be used to facilitate video sharing of the puppet performances. While some artists have evolved their work, others have completely shifted gear. The UK artist Alice Potts had planned to travel to Australia to continue her Sweat series: a project that involves turning perspiration samples into unexpectedly beautiful crystals, and incorporating them back into garments – football boots, ballet slippers and gymwear. That stopped being viable with the global circulation of a highly contagious virus that is spread through close contact and bodily fluids. Potts’ new work, Dance Biodegradable Personal Protective Equipment (DBPPE) Post COVID Facemasks, was inspired by a phone call from her London paramedic brother during the onset of the pandemic who had resorted to wearing bin liners for masks, such was the scarcity of PPE at the time. Getting the art to Australia also required tactical thinking. Freight flights weren’t leaving London, so works from the UK were bundled together and sent by rail to Amsterdam to meet a plane bound for Melbourne. Installation, particularly of site-specific work, has been a challenge, but Heron has nothing but praise for how the artists have handled it. “Artists and designers are problem-solvers by nature,” says Heron. “A challenge comes up or something that might be an impediment and they’re very good at finding a way to work through that.” The practical solutions involve the gallery’s design team doing more work in advance to create 3D visualisations of how works might look in a particular space, and coordinating with those artists online as things shift. Things may change again once the work is in situ, Heron says, but “that happens all the time”. His team has also reassessed the layout of the gallery to allow free movement between rooms and enough space for people to physically distance from each other while viewing the works. The result will be a more open-plan exhibition than some of the labyrinths of past shows, but it may come as a relief for those patrons who loathe crowded gallery corners. The 2017 Triennal remains the NGV’s most popular exhibition ever. If there were ambitions to repeat or best that success this time around, Heron is not admitting to it – particularly with closed borders and Melburnians who have grown wary of crowds. “I think it’s fair to say you’re not going to get the numbers that you would normally get,” he says. “But we certainly really hope that the Triennial is something that will appeal to a really diverse and broad amount of our community. “We’re really hopeful that people will come out to enjoy it, and hopefully we can provide a really good, safe space for them to do that.”"
"Late-night hosts addressed the White House’s coronavirus outbreak after a whirlwind weekend of headlines, health updates and spin that was overwhelming even by Trump-era standards. “Turns out while you’ve spent the last seven months hugging your grandma through a giant condom, Trump and his friends are having no-mask cocktail receptions indoors where the guest of honor is Covid-19,” said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. At least 30 people in Trump’s circle have tested positive for the virus since last week, including aide Hope Hicks, adviser Kellyanne Conway, and personal assistant Nick Luna. “It’s almost as if the writers of 2020 didn’t know how to wrap the story up so then they were like ‘uh, and then they all get coronavirus, the end,’” Noah said. For those who proclaimed that Trump’s infection was merely karma for downplaying a pandemic that has now killed more than 200,000 Americans, Noah offered a correction: “A massive outbreak at the White House is not karma. It’s consequences.” It’s bad enough that Trump’s White House flouted safety protocols before an outbreak, he continued, but “what’s even more disturbing is that after Trump found out that he could’ve been exposed to the virus, he didn’t quarantine. He didn’t social distance. He carried on with his life with complete disregard for other people’s lives.” Trump attended a fundraiser, sans mask, in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday evening despite knowing before leaving Washington that close aide Hicks had tested positive for the virus, a which is “truly despicable”, said Noah. “Trump knew that he could be infected and he put his own supporters at risk anyway? I feel so bad for anyone who paid money to attend this fundraiser,” he added. “Because those people didn’t want Covid. They just wanted to give Trump enough money so that he’d let them dump chemicals in a river. Why should something bad happen to them?” Trump returned home from Walter Reed medical center on Monday evening with a photo op in which he removed his mask on the steps of the White House. “My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone he’s about to infect,” said Stephen Colbert. “I’m glad the president is feeling better,” the Late Show host added, “and of course I wish him continued good health, and it goes without saying: what a tool.” Upon leaving Walter Reed, Trump tweeted that he was “feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life.” “So you’re saying the people who lost their lives, they either didn’t have enough moxie,” Colbert retorted, “or they didn’t live in a White House that has 20 full-time medical staff and get choppered to a suite at Walter Reed, where they received a combination of cutting-edge treatments that literally no one else on the planet has received?” On Late Night, Seth Meyers replayed footage from Trump’s widely condemned PR stunt on Sunday in which he demanded Secret Service agents drive him around Walter Reed in a hermetically sealed SUV to wave to admirers. The image of an infected president sealed inside a parade vehicle with as-yet-uninfected staff “captures all the heedless negligence and disregard for human life that has characterized the Trump administration and its response to the pandemic”, Meyers said. “He exposed Secret Service agents among others to a deadly virus just for a quick ego boost. “So what prompted this reckless jaunt that put people in harm’s way?” Meyers wondered. According to the Washington Post, Trump told advisers on Sunday that he was bored of sitting in the hospital and tired of watching news coverage of his hospitalization. “Bored? Your hospital suite is basically a luxury apartment,” Meyers retorted. “That room and your top-of-the-line medical care probably cost more than the $750 you paid in taxes.” The election, the White House outbreak at the Rose Garden party for Trump’s supreme court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, the confusing timelines on Trump’s Covid diagnosis from his doctors – “in a way, it’s all one story,” said Meyers. “That’s maybe the most bewildering fact of life in the Trump era: every day there’s a shocking new thing you could never have imagined in your wildest dreams, yet at the same time, every Trump story is basically the same Trump story: we can’t believe a word the president or his aides say. We have no idea what to believe.” And on The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon recapped Trump’s PR ride around Walter Reed, in which “the Secret Service had to take Trump around after 50 Uber XL drivers were like, ‘Hell no,’” he joked. “What is happening? Trump even turned a hospital stay into chaos. The Joker caused less problems when he visited Gotham General.” The stunt coincided with reports that Don Jr was “deeply upset” by the ride-around and thought his father was “acting crazy”. “You know things have gone off the rails when Don Jr becomes the voice of reason,” Fallon said. As for criticism of a photo the White House posted from Walter Reed to show Trump “working” by signing what appears to be a blank sheet of paper, Fallon joked it wasn’t all staged – “that’s not blank piece of paper, that’s just his entire plan to stop Covid.”"
"Professional female artists in Australia can expect to earn on average 25% less than their male counterparts, according to new research released on Wednesday by Macquarie University – and that figure rises to 30% when it comes to how much money professional female artists can expect to earn from the work they produce. The grim findings are the result of an analysis of income data from 826 working artists across multiple art forms – from visual arts and music to performance and writing – in 2016 and 2017, conducted by the university’s economics department.  Four years ago the gender pay gap between full-time working men and full-time working women across every industry and occupational category in Australia was 16%. In the succeeding interval, that gap has narrowed to 13.9% – the equivalent of $242.90 per week – according to data from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The university drew upon the Australia Council’s national survey of practising professional artists, Making Art Work, then set about exploring the variables that might explain the gaping gender pay gap. A co-author of the preliminary paper, Dr Sunny Y Shin, told Guardian Australia that the discrepancy between male and female earnings could still not be explained after taking into account multiple mitigating factors. “We looked at standard questions. For example, are women simply working less hours? That’s not true, the hours are similar,” she said. “So are women working in the arts less educated? That’s not true either – women are more educated in these fields. Do they have a higher rate of disability, or non-English speaking backgrounds, or have more children? “None of these could explain the different rate of return for men and women.  “We’re left with the conclusion that women [working in the arts] seem to be the subject of gender-related discrimination.” As part of the research, artists were asked what they thought was the most important factor that had advanced their career. “Women said ‘support from friends and family’ more than men did, and men reported more that it was their own talent,” she said. In First Nations communities, the gender pay gap between male and female artists was almost non-existent. Shin said the findings were preliminary and the issue of virtual income parity among Indigenous artists needed to be examined further, along with additional variables. Different approaches between male and female artists towards risk, competition and negotiation also needed to be examined further, she said. The research comes on the back of an analysis prepared for the Arts Industry Council of South Australia, using ABS data. The analysis found that during the Covid-19 pandemic, 36% of female job losses in the arts sector in South Australia translated to a 13.2% loss in wages, compared with a 27.5% job loss rate among males, resulting in 23% total wage loss. To mark International Women’s Day last year, the Museum of Contemporary Art published interviews discussing gender discrimination with three female artists featured in its collection. One was Janet Laurence, who said the public’s perception of artists being these “big heroic male figures” continued to be reinforced by Australia’s conservative press and political institutions. Sanné Mestrom said she believed there was now a lot of support for female artists. “However, the fact that there is such support actually points to the lack of it – and the need for it – in a broader sense,” she said. “Until women’s representation in exhibitions and collections is 50/50 with men, there remains work to be done.” Fiona Hall said she suspected she may have semi-consciously “opted to ignore/defy/deflect” any gender bias she may have encountered in her career. “I’m aware, though, that it’s too often a factor in the career trajectories of female artists – and it all too often begins at art school,” she said."
"Late-night hosts appeared generally jubilant on Monday evening, the first night of shows since American networks called the election for former vice-president Joe Biden on Saturday. “Darth Tax Evader has been toppled, and America responded with a dance party,” said Jimmy Kimmel before a montage of Americans from New York to Los Angeles dancing in the streets to celebrate Trump’s defeat. “Meanwhile, our out-of-touch-with-reality host is not letting go,” said Kimmel. “He is both melting and doubling down on his claim that the election was stolen from him” with baseless claims of voter fraud that have been roundly dismissed in court. Nevertheless, the Trump campaign is “getting all the sycophants on board to question the integrity of the election” although that of course does not include the Republican House and Senate seats won with the same ballots. “I wonder why that is?” Kimmel deadpanned. “Why would the Democrats have cheated and stolen the presidency but given up the Senate and House seats on the same ballot? Is it like when you cheat on a test and you get a few wrong just to throw the teacher off the scent? Are we supposed to believe there’s a universe in which Nancy Pelosi could’ve sent Mitch McConnell back to the exotic pets store he came from and she chose not to? “Listen, I get that this is hard for Donald Trump,” Kimmel conceded. “Processing a loss like this is gonna take time. I mean, this is the first time he’s ever failed at anything – besides his casinos, his airline, his mortgage, Trump steaks, Trump university, Trump magazine, Donald Jr, Eric, etc.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert celebrated Biden’s victory with a T-shirt cannon, glasses of champagne, and footage of jubilant parties across the US. Though Trump has refused to concede the election, shattering precedent, and congressional Republicans have almost uniformly fallen in line behind him, “it’s over,” said Colbert. The news of Trump’s defeat brought tears of relief and joy, Colbert revealed, especially for the long list of things to look forward to: extra brain space, a chance to be nicer. “I tend to reflect back the national tone, and that tone comes from the top,” Colbert explained. “The president’s only emotions are angry, look-at-me, and ‘I’m angry you’re not looking at me,’ and because he was the only thing we were focused on for the last four years – and this is entirely my responsibility – I’ve done harsher jokes than I’ve ever done in my entire life.” But mostly, Colbert was “looking forward to the idea of knowing things again”. “We’ve spent the last four years debating the value of the Enlightenment with a reality show host,” he added. “If the president were there when the apple hit Newton on the head, he would’ve called gravity a ‘Chinese hoax’ and the apple ‘Tim Apple’.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers tallied the many upsides to a Joe Biden presidency: “in addition to preserving what’s left of our democracy, reversing four years of malicious racism, savagery and criminal neglect, getting rid of Trump is just a quality of life issue,” he said, “like calling 311 about a jackhammer outside of your apartment. “And clearly I’m not the only one indulging myself in the joy and catharsis of seeing this deeply wretched husk of a man thrown out on his ass,” he added before footage of ecstatic election celebrations across the country. Meanwhile, on Fox News, Tucker Carlson tried to sow fear over the president-elect: “There is no Joe Biden. The man you remember from the 1980s is gone. He no longer exists. What remains is a projection of sorts, a hologram designed to mimic the behavior of a non-threatening political candidate.” Meyers responded: “By the way, to anyone who thought things were going to go back to normal once Trump was gone, just a reminder: Fox News called Biden a hologram who wants to force you to drink Starbucks, and he’s been president-elect for two days. “Can you imagine what it’s going to be like when Biden’s actually in office if Republicans hang on to control the Senate? Who knows if they’ll even let him have a cabinet? Sean Hannity will probably accuse Biden of building a Soros-funded Amtrak station on the moon.” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped the Republican blitz of laughably evidence-free claims of election fraud, which have been dismissed in courts from Michigan to Pennsylvania. “Are these guys kidding us? This was so batshit, I caught coronavirus just listening to it,” Noah said of some of the attempts to delegitimize the election. The GOP’s false cries of foul play are especially ironic, said Noah, because “America’s whole system is rigged – to help Donald Trump. The man lost by 4 million popular votes and still had a chance to win the electoral college. How does that make sense? The only person Donald Trump should be mad at is himself, because he started on third base and still somehow lost the game. “Maybe Trump will decide to concede eventually,” he later added. “Or, hey, maybe he won’t. That actually doesn’t really matter either way because it’s not his decision to make. Joe Biden is going to become president on January 20, and Trump’s opinion on that counts for exactly one vote. Same as any other vote in America. And I know it’s hard to believe but after all this time, it seems like reality has finally caught up with Donald Trump.”"
"There’s a glimmer of positivity amid Australia’s beleaguered arts industries: with Covid-19 restrictions limiting our ability to attend live shows or go to cinemas, book sales across the country have surged – with many readers returning to familiar authors, and the escapist comforts of fiction. According to Nielsen Book Australia, which tracks book sales nationally, the Australian market for books experienced a “steep decline” early in the year, but turned a corner over Easter and has been growing ever since. Adult fiction has done particularly well, with the firm noting a 13% rise in sales value in the year to mid-October. “People have more time to read the books they had always wanted to, either from their own bookshelf or a bestseller they had never got around to buying,” says HarperCollins chief executive Jim Demetriou, name-checking two of the company’s titles – Trent Dalton’s Boy Swallows Universe, and George RR Martin’s Game of Thrones – as bestsellers. In contemporary fiction, Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens and the final instalment of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall trilogy, The Mirror & the Light, have also been notable sellers. Bookshops are noticing trends too. During Brisbane’s lockdown earlier in the year, Chris Oliver, owner of Little Bird Bookshop, saw a rise in the sales of Australian books. “People have become interested in knowing their own city because they obviously aren’t traveling internationally, and they couldn’t even travel interstate, to a large extent.” He also noticed a shift away from new releases towards classics. Anna MacDonald, a bookseller at the Paperback Bookshop in Melbourne’s central business district, says one customer picked up six volumes of Proust at the beginning of the city’s second lockdown. “He said in the first lockdown he’d read Dostoevsky, and now in the second lockdown he was going to work his way through Proust.” Staff there have been offering personalised recommendations to online customers based on books they have previously enjoyed. Since March, the store has posted books daily on its website and social media platforms. “One of the challenges for us during the lockdown has been to find ways of maintaining that personal relationship with customers,” MacDonald says. “Sales have taken a pretty hard hit but we are still making enough to make ends meet.” In non-fiction, Australians responded strongly to the global protests sparked by the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, with books including Stan Grant’s Talking To My Country, Marcia Langton’s Welcome To Country, and Bruce Pascoe’s Dark Emu selling well. “That was really exciting to see Australian readers looking to books to inform and to guide them,” says Louise Sherwin-Stark, CEO of Hachette Australia & New Zealand, which publishes Me and White Supremacy by Layla Saad and So You Want To Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo. Books that offer practical ways of passing time have also sold well, including cookbooks, gardening and craft books, and a resurgence in adult colouring-in books. But while business is booming for online booksellers – Booktopia reported a 28% increase in sales in the 2020 financial year, driven substantially by Covid lockdowns – bricks and mortar stores have had an uneven year. In parts of the country now minimally affected by Covid-19 restrictions, physical bookshops are flourishing. “In small country towns, people have been tremendous in supporting local business,” says Diana Johnston, a book buyer for independent franchise group Collins Booksellers. “Our stores in the country have been doing exceptionally well.” For Michael Roach at the Book Cellar in Campbell Town, Tasmania – a town of fewer than 1,000 people, located between Hobart and Launceston – the absence of international tourists since March has been countered by strong online sales. “We had our best ever week’s trade when one particular book [Alice Irvine’s Central Cookery Book] took off online and we were the main supplier of it,” Roach says. But it’s been a difficult period for Melbourne booksellers, particularly those affected by a drastic drop in foot traffic through the CBD. Johnson, from Collins Booksellers, also co-owns the beloved Hill of Content, where sales have been “decimated”, she says. “Our turnover has probably dropped by about 80%.” The store is building its fledgling online business, which it launched in November last year. Johnston says that jobkeeper and the support from regular customers – some of whom have been frequenting the store for decades – have been lifelines, but she expects a lasting downturn in the coming months, as people continue to work from home and theatres remain shut. “We just have to adjust accordingly.” “Booksellers are really good at encouraging readers to try something they haven’t tried before,” says Sherwin-Stark, from Hachette. In the absence of personal recommendations, readers have returned to familiar favourites – Michael Robotham, Nick Earls and Jodi Picoult among them. Debut literary authors, for whom physical events are an important promotional tool, have had a tough year as a result, says Sherwin-Stark. And though virtual events have allowed authors to reach larger audiences, digital event fatigue has been a downside – which is why some publishers delayed the release of key titles to later in the year, in the hopes that in-person events would be possible by then. “Jane Harper, Trent Dalton, Andy Griffiths, Richard Flanagan – all of these people have published books in the last couple of weeks,” says Sherwin-Stark, in an interview at the end of October. Dalton’s All Our Shimmering Skies was delayed from June to October. “What you’re seeing now is a hugely crowded market” for publishers – but “for readers, the best Christmas of all time”."
"I’ve seen a lot and it still comes back to Sean Lock. When we used to play the clubs together, he was pretty much the only one that all us other comics on the bill would come out front to watch; I mean properly watch, like a punter. Probably Monty Python’s Albatross sketch. That beat John Cleese leaves between Terry Jones asking him whether “you get wafers with it” and his follow-up makes it. It peters out after that, but that’s always been the problem with sketches for me: often the journey is far better than the destination. Got to be The Harry Hill Movie, right? Channel 4 occasionally put it out at about seven in the morning! I caught a bit the other day, having not seen it for years and, rather embarrassingly, found myself really laughing! OK, you got me: The Producers. I collect joke books, but they don’t count, right? Then I’d go for The Tetherballs of Bougainville by Mark Leyner. It hasn’t really got a story as such, but it’s just packed full of funny, odd ideas.  Extras was great, wasn’t it? The Bowie bit. I have huge admiration for Ricky Gervais’s single-mindedness. I remember him when he was the entertainments manager at the University of London Union, and I also remember feeling a bit sorry for him! Neat the way it turned out. I worked in a pub at weekends when I was a teenager and there was no scheduled break for me and this girl that worked there – and we were scared of the boss, who was a highly strung Swede. One day she went out for a couple of hours, so we laid a table up in the pub and cooked ourselves a meal. Sausage and chips never tasted so good.  Wait a minute, you’re really asking this question of the man who does the voiceover for You’ve Been Framed!? Kitten falling off the draining board into the swing bin gets me every time. But, of course, it has to get out of the swing bin too, to prove it’s OK. Egg. Go on, say it again but imagine me saying it. Funny, right?  Harry Hill’s podcast Harry Hill’s Noise is available to stream now from all podcast platforms"
"Melburnians have until this Sunday to view a Brett Whiteley work that is expected to break all Australian art records when it goes under the hammer in Sydney on 26 November. Henri’s Armchair, an exceptionally large oil, ink and charcoal on canvas work from the artist’s famous Lavender Bay series, painted in 1974, is expected to fetch between $5m and $7m when it goes to auction in just under three weeks. The price estimate is set to easily tip the longstanding record for an artwork sold in Australia, set by Sidney Nolan’s First-class Marksman from his Ned Kelly series, which the Art Gallery of New South Wales paid $5.4m for in 2010. Justin Turner, head of art at Menzies Art Brands, which also sold the Nolan, said he believed the Whiteley would “breeze through” the record books. Renown barrister Clive Evatt QC bought the painting directly from the artist in 1975, where it hung in the lawyer’s Turramurra home until his death in 2018. In what has surprisingly turned out to be a booming art market in 2020, his widow Elizabeth Evatt has now decided to sell the work, Turner said. “In 2020 we have seen 20 new artist price records set at auction,” Turner said. “Despite the global pandemic, it has been an incredibly buoyant year for the Australian art market, with numerous new artist auction price records being set and clearance rates across the major art auction houses, both by value and volume, proving to be exceptionally strong.” Turner said Henri’s Armchair was Whiteley’s nod to French impressionist Henri Matisse, who once claimed art should “be something like a good armchair in which to rest from physical fatigue”. The work arrives in Sydney next week, with by-appointment-only viewings beginning in Kensington on 12 November."
"The comedian, mimic and actor John Sessions, who has died of a heart attack aged 67, had trouble being John Sessions. “The hardest part you’ll ever play, honey, is yourself,” he told an interviewer in 1994. Instead, he transformed himself into other people. His breakthrough 1987 one-man West End stage show, The Life of Napoleon, for instance, was described thus by one critic: “In the course of a few sentences Sessions is liable to change voices from Olivier to Lofty of EastEnders, include a pun and a simile, refer to Picasso and Faulkner and move from the battle of Jena to a golf course. It is exhausting, exhilarating and mostly very funny.” Sessions made his name on TV in the comedy show Whose Line Is It Anyway? (1988-91), in which contestants (other regulars included Stephen Fry and Josie Lawrence) would improvise sketches suggested by the studio audience. He was in his element, imagining how James Joyce would spend a day at the beach, or how Hemingway might behave at the dentist. When the contestants were asked to impersonate the person they would least like to be trapped with in a lift, Paul Merton said: “Hello, my name is John Sessions.” Sessions took it on the chin: “A lot of people found me infuriating – they thought I was a smart aleck, but I did try not to be.” And yet on that show, and others, including the BBC’s panel show QI, he never wore his learning lightly, outsmarting the erudite Fry in the first episode of QI in 2003 by knowing Michelangelo’s dates of birth and death. Unlike many of his peers, he had not been to Oxbridge, and he had failed to complete his PhD thesis on the poet John Cowper Powys. Had he become Dr Sessions, wrote one armchair analyst, “perhaps he would not feel compelled to display his erudition; but then he would have been lost to the stage, which would have been a pity”. The smart aleck image stuck, so much so that when Spitting Image produced a puppet of Sessions in 1989, he was represented disappearing up his own fundament. Sessions was singular in having served on the show both as impressionist (his 40-voice repertoire included Prince Edward, Laurence Oliver, Norman Tebbit and Keith Richards) and target. His appearance as a rubberised member of Kenneth Branagh’s Brit Pack discombobulated Sessions: “Suddenly on the telly I saw this brilliant puppet with this funny tie and baggy cheeks and it was me going up my ass. That was quite scary. I thought, ‘Am I going up my ass?’” Such self-doubt was typical. Sessions was prone to depression, said he loathed his appearance, and was given in interviews to self-laceration. In 1999 he told the Sunday Times: “Some nights, I can’t get to sleep and lie there looking back on my life and eventually nod off thinking, ‘I’m completely useless and hopeless, talentless and should fuck off.’” He was not mollified when the interviewer told him no one else had ever had that thought about him. He was born in Largs, Ayrshire. His father, John Marshall, was a peripatetic gas engineer, and a Protestant; his mother, Esmé (nee Richardson), was a Glaswegian Catholic ostracised by her family when she got married. He had a twin sister, Maggie, and an older brother, Bill, who was 12 when the twins were born. “I remember thinking I mustn’t cause my parents any trouble, because they were that much older.” He liked to be at home with his mother: “We used to have a sort of confidentiality of humour. We’d find funny the unacknowledgedly absurd. Which I think is the type of stuff I do, and which still makes me laugh.”  When John was three, the family moved to England, eventually settling in St Albans, where he was educated at Verulam school. He did his first impersonation aged seven, singing Lonnie Donegan’s Hang Down Your Head Tom Dooley, partly to impress his father.  He went to Bangor University to read English with the aim of becoming a teacher. Then his father organised a personnel job for him at the gas board. “I told Dad it was boring, and the next thing he knew was that I was going off to do a PhD in Ontario.” He found Canada cold and depressing, and said that his uncompleted dissertation consisted of “200 pages of rubbish”. Aged 26, he returned to the UK and applied to Rada. He arrived at his audition with a hangover. “I did Benedick’s ‘This can be no trick …’ from Much Ado. Hugh Cruttwell [Rada’s principal] said: ‘That was terrible. You weren’t acting, you were doing an impersonation of what an actor sounds like.’” But a second performance, from Pinter’s The Homecoming, won him a scholarship. Better, it led to a lifelong friendship with Branagh, a fellow student, who later directed him on stage in The Life of Napoleon and in the film version of Henry V (1989) and his comedy In the Bleak Midwinter (1995). Finding there was another John Marshall in Equity, he changed his name to Sessions. When he left Rada, he said, “my plan was to try and do two careers at once – to be a comedian and an actor. For some years, I managed to juggle the two, but I never felt I joined either club.” He worked the comedy circuit in London, sometimes appearing on the same bill as French and Saunders, often doing rarefied material, such as imagining Milan Kundera’s version of the TV soap Dallas. He would cement his brand as abstruse improv virtuoso with the TV shows John Sessions’ Tall Tales (1991) and John Sessions’ Likely Stories (1994). In 1994, in an interview promoting his performance in Kevin Elyot’s Aids drama My Night With Reg, he was asked by an interviewer if he was gay. “I said ‘Yes I am, but my parents don’t know, and I don’t want them to find out by picking up a copy of the Evening Standard.’ The journalist said she thought I should tell them and outed me. My mother died unexpectedly six weeks later, and my father quickly developed dementia. It was never mentioned.” Sessions explained his compunctions about telling his parents about his sexuality. “They weren’t going to go to their graves hating me or throw me out of the house, but they were born before the first world war and they might have died thinking it was their ‘fault’.” One night at the Criterion theatre during My Night With Reg, Sessions forgot his lines and had to leave the stage. “It wasn’t stage fright, because I’d been on for six weeks. It was because everything got too much for me. I’d been home for Christmas and found that my father, who was suffering from a mental illness after my mother died, had filled the fridge full of presents for her.” After that, he did not return to theatre for many years. “I should have gone to the RSC or the National and done four or five plays, really worked my arse off. Some good old-fashioned graft would have done me the power of good. But I couldn’t face a play again.” Only in 2013 did he return to the stage, in his friend the novelist William Boyd’s play Longing. “I thought it was going to lead to all kinds of interesting things, but I wasn’t killed in the rush.” He never recaptured the fame of his first few years in TV. “I had a twinkly couple of years, but then I ran out of steam,” he told the Guardian in 2014. “As I was getting older, I wasn’t getting more confident, I was getting less confident. I lost my way.” Arguably, he found it again through his talent for mimicry, when he starred in and co-wrote Stella Street, the 1997-2001 BBC series that imagined a street in Surbiton populated by movie stars.  Mimicry served him well in later triumphs on TV and in the cinema. He was Geoffrey Howe in Margaret (2009), Harold Wilson in Made in Dagenham (2010), Ted Heath in The Iron Lady (2011), Norman Tebbit in The Hunt for Tony Blair (2011), and in 2015 he was note perfect as Arthur Lowe performing Captain Mainwaring in We’re Doomed! The Dad’s Army Story. His later roles were mainly minor ones, but he stole the show as Dr Prunesquallor, oleaginous royal physician to the House of Groan in the 2000 adaptation of Mervyn Peake’s Gormenghast. Away from stage and screen, Sessions claimed to be a loner. “I like the solitary life,” he once said. Latterly, the man of a thousand characters found consolation in playing the role of an ageing buffer drifting rightwards politically. He had once supported Labour but later voted for Ukip, saying that “the European Union is the biggest money-wasting piece of shit” and that the Scottish parliament should be scrapped. “I’m pretty much one character really,” he reflected. “A grumpy old fool.” He is survived by his sister and brother."
"Queensland Theatre has responded to criticisms over its 2021 program, with artistic director Lee Lewis acknowledging that having just one First Nations work in the season was “not ideal” – and that leaving it out of the season announcement was “a fail”. The program, announced on Sunday, has been criticised by industry heavyweights including two former Queensland Theatre artistic directors: Sydney Festival director Wesley Enoch and theatre director Sam Strong. Enoch told the Courier Mail on Wednesday he was “shocked and disappointed that all the work we’ve been doing over a decade seems to have disappeared. There will be lots of excuses but when push came to shove it seemed the thing to leave out was the blackfellas.” On Facebook, Strong addressed the anger expressed by Enoch and other Indigenous artists, including Chenoa Deemal and Elaine Crombie. “Hopefully, this difficult moment is one in which anger can be heard and acknowledged, mistakes owned, and First Nations artists embraced and celebrated by the company,” he said. In an apology and statement released on Thursday, the company acknowledged that the announcement of its 2021 program had cast doubt on its commitment to developing First Nations works. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” it said. “While our 2021 Season in Brisbane does not include a First Nations work, we will be presenting Othello, adapted by Jason Klarwein and Jimi Bani, in Cairns in 2021 to coincide with the Cairns Indigenous Arts Fair (CIAF). “We did not include this in the season launch as the date for CIAF in 2021 is yet to be finalised. This was a mistake.” Lewis, who lamented the lack of racial diversity in Australian theatre in a Currency Press essay in 2007, said not including Othello in the program announcement was “not good enough … on a communications level, it was a fail”. She said shutdowns caused by the global pandemic – coupled with Queensland Theatre’s prior lack of investment in local Indigenous artists – resulted in the 2021 season having just one First Nations work. “It’s not an excuse, it’s not ideal … but there was simply no First Nations works ready,” she said. Lewis said when she took up her position with the company in January, she consulted widely with the Indigenous arts community. “It became clear we had to build a new pipeline for works by local First Nations artists, and not just buy in shows from other states,” she told the Guardian. “But I knew it wasn’t going to happen overnight. “Then when Covid hit, I made the decision [in consultation with the government] to commit all $650,000 of our commissioning and development funding to First Nations work.” Two Indigenous works are now under way with another two on the drawing board, she said, pending additional funding from independent sources. “But these are works in development for 2022, not 2021, and we can’t start waving them about before they are ready.” On Thursday morning, Lewis met Queensland’s arts minister, Leeanne Enoch – Wesley’s sister – to apologise for “messing up” the company’s communications. Lewis copped a further round of criticism on social media after announcing the Othello production would premiere in Cairns, not Brisbane, seemingly giving the production lesser status. But Lewis told the Guardian the bilingual (Kala Lagaw Ya and English) production was being transported from its 16th century Venetian setting to the Torres Strait Islands during World War II, and would be its first production developed and embedded in the Torres Strait Islander community. “And we are a state company, not a Brisbane company,” she said. The controversy is just the latest in a renewed push for more racial diversity in the Australian arts industry, coming three months after the Rob Guest Endowment delivered a list of “uniformly white” semifinalists for its musical theatre award. The criticisms resulted in the cancellation of the $50,000 scholarship, after the nominees expressed solidarity with their allegedly overlooked peers."
"Bringing Up Baby (1938) Here is the classic screwball comedy with Cary Grant as the distracted palaeontologist who wishes for nothing more than to assemble the perfect brontosaurus skeleton, who then meets the charming if wayward Katharine Hepburn, who has a boisterous leopard called Baby that can only be pacified by singing I Can’t Give You Anything But Love.

Available on demand from 5 November to 4 December, tickets €9.90. Covid Fan Tutte Finnish National Opera’s bespoke show – in which rehearsals for a production of Die Walküre are interrupted by the pandemic, and its cast redeployed to perform a satire on the ever-changing situation and its impact on the everyday lives of Finnish people – is huge fun. Mozart’s Così provides the names of many of the characters, and also most of the music, which is conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, with Karita Mattila as Despina.

"Going up close to a great work of art, perhaps to Auguste Rodin’s full-height sculpture of a shy Eve, is a rare pleasure in a neighbourhood gallery, especially since opening hours are now restricted by the pandemic. The Southampton City Art Gallery is one of those municipal buildings with perhaps more than its fair share of unexpected treats due to the bequest of a local chemist and businessman called Robert Chipperfield. He died rich in 1911, instructing his legacy to be spent on filling up a new gallery with top-notch pieces like Eve. Just over a decade ago the city considered selling valuable works including its Rodin sculpture, then worth just over £1million, to fund other projects, but the sale was stopped by a petition and a stern warning from the Tate, which had an advisory role. “We believe the sale of works acquired through the Chipperfield bequest to raise funds towards a capital project is not advisable and, indeed, not in the spirit of the bequest,” the Tate ruled back then. Today, in the grip of Covid-19, many galleries, museums and libraries, large and small, national and provincial, are considering making similarly controversial moves. A deep drop in revenue and donations has shaken the foundations of many a neo-classical portico. But should an artwork donated to the public ever be sold off as an asset? Writer Malcolm Gladwell has dared to say “yes” to this divisive question. Looking in particular at the wealthy arts citadels of Manhattan in his podcast Revisionist History in June, Gladwell used the phrase “dragon psychology” to characterise the thinking of the custodians of valuable cultural objects. He explained his argument to the Observer this weekend: “The dragon, in folklore, hoards treasure and virgins, even though he has no romantic interest in women and no desire to show or share or otherwise enjoy his treasure. “Since most major art museums now have upwards of 95% of their collections in storage – where they can’t be shown or shared or otherwise enjoyed – doesn’t that sound like dragon behaviour?” This autumn the Observer reported on the Royal Opera House’s decision to put a David Hockney portrait under the hammer to raise crucial funds, and also on the contentious fate of the Royal Academy of Arts’ famous Taddei Tondo; a marble sculpture by Michelangelo Buonarotti, the sale of which would rescue the institution from financial peril. Several other cultural and educational organisations have put historic objects up for sale after staring grimly at their balance sheets. The Royal College of Physicians was to sell a stack of rare books at Bonhams to deal with a funding shortfall of £3m, but now says it has taken “no firm decisions”. More than 600 of its fellows and members, including a former government chief scientific adviser, Mark Walport, were irate enough to pen an open letter to the president of the college arguing that a sale would represent “a breach of trust between the public, the benefactors and the college through the irreparable damage caused by the transfer of the college’s and the nation’s cultural inheritance into private hands”. In England, the rules about these matters are laid down by the Museums Association’s code of ethics, used to set Arts Council England’s standards, and they state that artefacts “should not normally be regarded as financially negotiable assets”. Last week it emerged the English public school Rugby is to auction a selection of valuable works including a 1632 second edition of A Shakespeare Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies with an estimate of between £20,000 and £30,000 and a first edition Christmas Carol by Dickens from 1843 that is likely to go for £4,000. The online sale at Forum Auctions takes place on Wednesday and does not, the school says, reflect any financial difficulty. Headmaster Peter Green said he simply wants the rare titles to be in specialist hands and added: “The school is committed, as a registered charity, to use its resources to benefit current and future students.” And there is a non-pandemic precedent. In 2018, Rugby made a cool £15m by selling off a collection of old master drawings at Christie’s. It is more difficult to remain sanguine, though, when the very purpose of your organisation is the making and sharing of art. At the Royal Academy of Arts (RA) opinions are split. Many believe retaining Michelangelo’s Tondo is essential to the spirit of the academy, while a smaller group of academicians argue that the work, as a last resort, is less important than the threatened jobs of staff. Certainly selling off the family silver, or “deaccessioning”, as it is known in curatorial circles, is not always judged beyond the pale. Alison Cole, editor of the Art Newspaper and author of a book about Michelangelo’s Tondo, knows it can be done properly.  “It depends how you handle it,” she said. “Tate did it in an exemplary way a few years ago and were open about the process. On the other hand, it would be crazy for the Academy to sell the Tondo, one of the greatest examples of Michelangelo’s work in the country. It would be far too expensive for any other British gallery to buy, so we would lose it. “It is also a work that lays out the artist’s whole process and that seems highly appropriate for an academy.” Writing in the Spectator last month, art critic Martin Gayford was equally unhappy at the idea of the loss of the Tondo: “The RA has sometimes seemed unsure of what to do with it,” he admitted, but concluded: “The rationale, saving jobs and securing the RA’s financial future, is comprehensible. But I suspect that it would be a big mistake.” Over at the Victoria and Albert Museum the feasibility of editing down the collection is perhaps more obvious. Twenty years ago the former director Mark Jones and the late Matthew Evans, then chairman of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, debated how best to deal with the crates and crates of artefacts and design objects held in permanent storage. From this was born the idea of putting the V&A stores on show at a new site in east London, as a kind of behind-the-scenes glimpse. The current director Tristram Hunt says plans for V&A East are on track. “We have all these fantastic items that people will be able to come and see. It shows that with the right kind of thinking you can turn the issue around and make it an attraction in its own right, especially for researchers, without having to sell anything off,” he said. In America, strict guidelines that prevented such sell-offs were lifted this spring. Art collections in Syracuse, Indianapolis, Fort Worth and Laguna Beach, among others, have offered works for sale during a two-year “window” intended to help galleries and museums survive the devastating Covid-19 period. Yet planned sales by the Brooklyn Museum and the Baltimore Museum of Art have provoked widespread protests. In Baltimore two artists on the gallery’s board of trustees resigned and a couple of leading benefactors withdrew support as a result of the agreed sale of Andy Warhol’s Last Supper and two other modern works. The Sotheby’s sale, which was called off with only two hours to go last month, would have raised $65m to spend on re-balancing the museum’s collection in favour of work from more diverse artists. It would also have gone, it was claimed, on improving staff salaries and conservation costs. Art is not for hoarding, argued Baltimore curators Asma Naeem and Katy Siegel: “Museums are not mausoleums or treasure houses, they are living organisms, oriented to the present as well as the past.” In an attempt to clarify the position in America, Brent Benjamin, president of the Association of Art Museum Directors, publicly welcomed Baltimore’s decision. “I am gratified to learn that the Baltimore Museum of Art has decided to reverse course,” he wrote. “As we have said consistently, our April 2020 resolutions were not intended to address needs beyond current, pandemic-related financial challenges.” Yet on the same night, Brooklyn Museum raised almost $20m from the sale of seven works by artists including Henri Matisse, Joan Miró and Claude Monet. The museum in New York had laid off 7% of its staff this summer. “The Monet happens to be lovely but is not one of his great works nor close to the best in our collection,” its director, Anne Pasternak, said. This month the leading international curator Francesco Bonami told ArtNews he believed the current debate might have a silver lining if it persuaded more galleries to focus on improved programming rather than on growth. “I don’t see anything wrong in selling work with a high market value that an institution considers redundant,” he said, adding: “Before a museum decides to sell its collection assets, it should first reduce other often exaggerated costs and maybe cancel a useless expansion.” Like Bonami’s criticisms, Gladwell’s attack on the “dragon psychology” of major cultural institutions is really an attempt to shake up the sheltered complacency they detect. Perhaps, then, it is not too cynical to suggest that some of the controversial high-profile sales of work this year are at least in part designed as public sacrifices that may win over hearts and minds at a time of austerity. Announcing the sale of Hockney’s 1971 Portrait of Sir David Webster, the illustrious former general administrator of the Royal Opera House, Alex Beard, chief executive at Covent Garden, told the Observer he knew it was important to make it clear to government and to potential donors that an institution often regarded as wealthy was willing to feel some real pain. The painting, which had originally been paid for with staff donations, sold at Christie’s for the lower end of its estimate at £11m, or £12.8m with fees. There is speculation that the buyer was David Ross, the founder of Carphone Warehouse, who took over as chair of the opera house this summer. Ross is known to collect Hockneys. Christie’s, however, is protecting the buyer’s anonymity. Art experts now wonder whether the art market will soon be flooded and sale values pushed down. But this looks unlikely in Britain, where museum ownership still adds lustre to the provenance of a lot. A more pressing danger is that future visitors to Britain’s smaller galleries will have fewer chances to bump into the life-size work of a renowned artist like Rodin."
"As of Tuesday evening, Donald Trump, predictably, refused to concede the presidential election, a defiance of the democratic process echoed on Fox News, the same network that declared Joe Biden the winner, along with every other network. “So which one is it?” Trevor Noah joked on Tuesday’s Daily Show. “It’s like when your dog wants to play fetch, but then refuses to let go of the ball. “And whether these people believe what they’re saying or they’re just pretending to believe it, it’s terrifying either way,” Noah continued. “But regardless, it’s not surprising.” It’s not surprising that the president’s “ride-or-die” Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson are backing his unsubstantiated attempts to discredit the election, Noah added. “What is a bigger deal, is that Republicans with actual power,” such as Senators Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell; the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; and the attorney general, William Barr, “are also throwing their weight behind Trump’s election challenges”. By Tuesday, both McConnell and Graham had spoken publicly in favor of Trump’s baseless, distracting accusations of voter fraud, while Pompeo remarked at a press conference that there would be a “smooth transition” to the second Trump administration. “The truth of the matter is, most other Republicans know that Joe Biden will be the next president,” Noah explained. “And right now, they’re just saying what Trump and his base want to hear, not because they’re worried about the vote that just happened, but because of the one that’s around the corner” – the two Senate run-off contests in Georgia to be held on 5 January, which will determine narrow control of the Senate. In other words, “Trump is screaming made-up shit that’s weakening trust in American democracy, but Republicans are going along with it so that they can squeeze out a few more seats in the Senate,” Noah concluded. “That’s like burning down your house just to make s’mores. Or dating Kevin Federline just you can maybe meet Britney Spears. Is it worth it?” “Oh what a strange and troubling world some people would like this to be,” a somber Stephen Colbert said on Tuesday evening. Just one night before, the Late Show host poured champagne to toast the incoming Biden administration; 24 hours later, Colbert shattered the bottle. “I will cut you if you come near me, because there’s some crazy shit going on out there!” he joked. “On Monday, our soon-to-be former president, citing baseless charges of non-existent fraud, instructed government leaders to block cooperation with President-elect Biden’s transition team,” Colbert explained. And “after being non-committal about the whole president-for-life thing”, McConnell claimed before Congress that American institutions were “actually built for” Trump’s baseless protestations of the election: “We have the system in place to consider concerns, and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.” “All he’s saying is that yes, people are concerned about that stick of dynamite, but the president is fully within his legal rights to light the fuse,” Colbert mocked. “Scissors are in place to cut the fuse if it gets too close, OK? Great, who’s got the scissors? Oh wait, we gave them to the president – I’m sure he’ll do the right thing.” On Monday, the party line extended to the justice department, as Barr discarded decades of precedent in staying out of electiosn with a memo that authorized federal prosecutors to investigate “substantial allegations” of voter fraud before the results of the presidential election are certified. “So federal officials are now planning to intervene in our election at the request of their leader. That also has a bit of an international feel, doesn’t it?” said an incensed Colbert. “During Covid, this is the closest we’re gonna get to an overseas vacation – ‘Wow, such a fascinating country. Ooh, I’m going to drink coffee in little cups, order a croissant, poop standing up and just enjoy the coup d’etat.’” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel stewed over America’s “Potus [who] refuses to go-tus”, as Trump still denied the results of the election. “Are we sure Donald Trump isn’t just stuck in a White House bathtub and too embarrassed to call for help?” Kimmel wondered. “A reality show host who will not accept reality.” “How pleased with himself is Vladimir Putin right now?” Kimmel later said, joking that the Russian president’s investment in election interference in 2016 was akin to hitting “the Destroy America lotto”. More seriously, Kimmel explained that he was “less disgusted with our toddler-in-chief throwing his oatmeal at the wall than I am with the Republican congress-people who are going along with this. “The baby’s right!” he added, mocking the GOP. “That oatmeal should go on the wall! He’s within his rights to throw it on the wall. We need to let the process of oatmeal-slinging play out.’”"
"It’s been nine months since America went into lockdown, but there’s finally a light at the end of the tunnel, said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show, as Britain inoculated its first citizen against the coronavirus. “Now that Britain has the vaccine, Americans are asking the American questions, like ‘give it to me,’” Colbert explained. But it might be longer yet until Americans are vaccinated en masse, as it was revealed this week that the Trump administration passed on securing additional doses of the Pfizer vaccine now being distributed in Britain. “It’s leadership like that, that will ensure the president will continue to lose the election,” Colbert joked. “It’s all laid out in the new book, The Art of Why Didn’t You Make the Damn Deal?!” Trump attempted to counter the embarrassing story on Tuesday with a White House vaccine summit (skipped by the two leading vaccine companies, Moderna and Pfizer) in which he bragged about the administration’s Operation Warp Speed and signed an executive order proclaiming that other nations will not get the US supplies of its vaccine until Americans have been inoculated. The order is moot, since the US will probably be the country short on vaccines; it appears to have “no real teeth”, according to the New York Times, “and it’s signed by a man who has no real hair or brain”, added Colbert. Trump also promised, without evidence, that Covid infection rates in the US will “skyrocket downward”. “Ah, yes, that classic symbol of success: a rocket in the sky, plummeting toward the ground,” Colbert deadpanned. “It’s like they say: shoot for the moon – if you miss, you will die alone in a frozen metal tube.” Meanwhile, the president once again tried to overturn the election with two phone calls to the Republican speaker of Pennsylvania’s house of representatives, days after he pressured Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp to convene a special legislative session to override the state’s election results (Kemp declined). “Come on, man, at a certain point you have to understand that it is over!” Colbert implored. “There’s a reason you don’t see headstones that say, ‘I’d like a second opinion!’ “It’s horrifying, but at this point, no one should be surprised,” the host continued. “Say what you will, but at least the president called. It’s so much more personal than destroying democracy by text.” “Donald Trump knows what he’s getting his loved ones for Christmas this year, assuming he’s capable of love,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night, as the president reportedly considered handing out pardons “like Christmas gifts” during his final days in office. One source told Axios that Trump offended a staff member by pre-emptively assuming they would like a pardon, even though the official had not committed any crimes. “The big question is: will Trump be allowed to pardon himself?” Kimmel explained. “He must think so because he’s still trying to put the squeeze on state officials” with two phone calls this week pressuring Pennsylvania’s speaker of the house to invalidate Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “This is where we are as a country right now – our president is cold-calling state representatives asking them to throw the election his way, like it’s a beauty pageant or something,” Kimmel lamented. In other news, Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis tested positive for coronavirus days after she attended the White House Christmas party on Friday sans mask. The diagnosis has reportedly angered some senior Trump officials who were also in attendance. “Well, why were they at the party?” Kimmel wondered. “Why did you have a party in the first place?” It’s all a bit ironic, given that just months ago, Ellis tweeted “there is no pandemic” – “so I’m starting to think the virus may have a sense of humor about all this,” Kimmel quipped. And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah blasted Trump’s handling of the Pfizer vaccine deal, which offered the US doses now allotted to other countries after the administration punted on the deal. “That’s the art of the deal right there, baby,” Noah mocked. “Pfizer thought that they could pull a fast one on Trump by offering to sell him life-saving vaccines, but my man Trump was like, ‘no deal. So now, Europe is stuck with all those vaccines, and that means more corona for everyone here in America, baby! Wait … “Seriously though, this may seem like it was a dumb decision by Trump,” Noah added. “But if you take a moment to think about it, you realize that it was a really fucking dumb decision by Trump.”"

Glyndebourne (nr Lewes, 20 May to 29 August) kicks things off with six productions, three of which – including Kát’a Kabanová – are brand new. Garsington, Longborough and The Grange follow. AC An A-list jazz quartetSaxophonist Joshua Redman, pianist Brad Mehldau, bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade’s 1994 debut was all too brief – because they were all on the verge of their own starry careers. This year they reunite (Barbican, EC2, 11 July) with their compelling RoundAgain album. JF Brilliant black historyThe black cinema renaissance continues. This month sees Regina King’s One Night in Miami (15 January, Amazon Prime Video), bringing together Cassius Clay, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown, and new doc MLK/FBI (15 January). The theme continues through Lee Daniels’ The United States vs Billie Holiday (12 March), and Judas and the Black Messiah with Daniel Kaluuya as Black Panthers chairman Fred Hampton. Making a song and dance of itStage-tested musicals are coming to a screen near you, including drag-teen smash Everybody’s Talking About Jamie (26 February), Lin-Manuel Miranda’s pre-Hamilton In the Heights (30 July) and Spielberg’s West Side Story (10 December). Miranda also scores the animated Vivo (about a music-loving monkey), while Camila Cabello is a singing Cinderella (5 February), and biopic subjects include Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Super new superheroesOver the Avengers? Don’t worry: this year promises a cornucopia of fresh comic-book characters to perk up the genre. A new phase of Marvel movies brings kung-fu master Shang-Chi (9 July) and the godlike Eternals (including Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Richard Madden and Kumail Nanjani (5 November). DC has The Suicide Squad (6 August), with Margot Robbie, Idris Elba and Peter Capaldi, and there is Jared Leto’s antihero Morbius (19 March). Do call it a comebackWe’ve had so many undercooked revivals in recent years, but we refuse to learn. Don’t pretend you’re not excited to see familiar faces such as Keanu Reeves’s Neo, back for a fourth Matrix instalment (22 December). Or 80s survivors such as Tom Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick (2 July) and Eddie Murphy’s Coming 2 America (5 March), or even the goofball Space Jam: A New Legacy (16 July), with LeBron James this time. Also back are the high priests of refusing to grow up: the Jackass crew. Just going to the cinemaWe’ve done the experiment, and can conclude that horrors are scarier, comedies funnier, dramas more dramatic, and movies just better when we’re experiencing them together on a big screen. We’ll be so happy when cinemas properly reopen, even the things that used to annoy us will be gratefully received: aren’t these lava-coated nachos delicious? Feel free to take the arm rest! Forgot to turn off your phone? That’s fine! SR Art festivals are set to make a comebackThere is real urgency to the cutting-edge arts festivals this year. Set to reignite creative vim in recently emptied urban centres far beyond London are the five-yearly state-of-the-nation survey The British Art Show (6 March to 4 September), visiting Wolverhampton, Plymouth, Aberdeen and Manchester; the Liverpool Biennial (20 March to 6 June); and Glasgow International (11 to 27 June). Blockbuster showsThis year’s hottest tickets include the father of modern sculpture Auguste Rodin’s works in plaster, which give free rein to his experimental impulses (Tate Modern, SE1, 29 April to 31 October); a major retrospective of Paula Rego’s satirical paintings tackling hard-hitting subjects from fascism to abortion (Tate Britain, SW1, 16 June to 24 October); and Albrecht Dürer’s work, traced through his travels in Europe (The National Gallery, WC1, 6 March to 13 June). Art responds to Black Lives MatterIncreasingly diverse programming includes Black Arts Movement leading light Lubaina Himid’s witty theatrical tableaux (Tate Modern, SE1, 25 November to 22 May 2022) and Michael Armitage’s subversive east African dreamscapes (Royal Academy of Arts, W1, 13 March to 6 June). The surrealist photographer Eileen Agar (Whitechapel Gallery, E1, 10 February to 23 May) and abstract painter Sophie Taeuber-Arp (Tate Modern, SE1, 15 July to 17 October) are the latest undersung women getting their dues in the reappraised pantheon. Creativity on south-east shoresEstuary 2021 (22 May to 13 June) will see artists mining the overlooked industrial sites, nature reserves and landmarks that dot the Thames as it winds through Essex and north Kent. Meanwhile, for Creative Coast, south-east art spaces have worked together to devise site-specific works on watersides from Gravesend to Eastbourne (from 14 May). All shall have top prizesRecent iterations of the UK’s big art prizes – the international Artes Mundi (various venues, Cardiff, 13 February to 6 June) and the UK-focused Turner prize (Herbert Art Gallery & Museum, Coventry, 29 September to 12 January 2022) have been turned on their heads. Winners have either shared the prize money with other contenders, or the judges awarded everyone. With solidarity upstaging competition, expect more reinvention of the format this year. SS Romeos and JulietsIt is a year of sweet sorrow with three bold new takes on Shakespeare’s star-crossed romance. The National Theatre has converted its Lyttelton stage into a temporary film studio for a TV version, starring Jessie Buckley and Josh O’Connor, which airs in spring. Dear Evan Hansen’s Sam Tutty joins Emily Redpath in a new film shot with isolated actors using green screen. And choreographer Rosie Kay transfers the tragedy to Brum’s black and south-Asian communities (Birmingham Hippodrome, 17 March). Puppet masteryThis summer sees a huge street party thrown for a nine-year-old refugee. Her name’s Little Amal, she will have travelled all the way from the Turkish-Syrian border and, oh yes, she’s a 3.5 metre-tall puppet created by the War Horse team. Symbolising millions of displaced children, the puppet will go on an “epic theatrical journey” through Europe en route to Manchester international festival (4 July). New venues open upClosures dominated 2020 but a handful of brave venues will open their doors in 2021. Liverpool’s PurpleDoor promises stories about local lives, with all performances free. Reading Rep turns an old Salvation Army building into a theatre. In London, the Arcola hosts a festival in its new outdoor space, and Woolwich Works is a new arts destination by the Thames. Sing when you’re winningAfter all those Covid-safe monologues and pared-back productions, a chorus line of musicals is waiting to explode on to the stage: Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella, Broadway hit Frozen, Back to the Future, The Drifters Girl with Beverley Knight, Monsoon Wedding, Strictly Ballroom, Get Up Stand Up! The Bob Marley Musical and the return of Hairspray are all worth making a song and dance about. Worldwide wondersLockdown has led to a boom in interactive digital experiences: a hybrid form that is its own thing entirely. The Big Tiny, Exit Productions, Swamp Motel, Coney and Fast Familiar are all making participatory stories that feel distinctly theatrical. Les Enfants Terribles’ Sherlock Holmes adventure The Case of the Hung Parliament (27 January to 17 February) is just one to investigate in 2021. CW Magic and monstersPostponed premieres are itching to finally get on stage, and there is a touch of the supernatural afoot. Akram Khan’s Creature (Sadler’s Wells, EC1, 23 September to 2 October), for English National Ballet, is inspired by Shelley’s Frankenstein while, on the lighter side, Drew McOnie brings Merlin back to life for Northern Ballet. Another fairytale show, BalletLorent’s The Lost Happy Endings (Sadler’s Wells, EC1, 2 & 3 April), should at last get its chance to tour. Embracing digital For a long time, dance on film was seen as a poor relation to stage. But 2020 forced a reconsideration, and choreographers have enjoyed reaching audiences beyond the confines of the theatre. Expect more in 2021 as Sadler’s Wells starts the year with a livestreamed festival, Dancing Nation (28 January, BBC iPlayer), featuring performances from Natalia Osipova, Matthew Bourne’s New Adventures and new companies to watch: Matsena Productions and Humanhood. LW  The non-Zoom-based comedy fest is back One by one, they fell: Melbourne, Brighton, Machynlleth, then – gasp – Edinburgh, too. But if 2020 was an endless winter, the thaw starts from February, when the UK’s second-biggest such event, Leicester comedy festival (3 to 21 February), returns to the stage. Will the fringe follow suit? We can only hope. The rise and rise of the standup specialWe missed live comedy in 2020, but there was no shortage of onscreen standup. There will be more in 2021, as YouTube, NextUp and Amazon Prime Video shake their spoons hungrily at Netflix’s standup pie. The latter has struck a deal with live comedy hotspot Soho Theatre for two series of specials. 2020s heroes finally take to the stage In a year without live performance, comedy’s brightest new talents had to find other ways to make their name. Enter viral Room Next Door star Michael Spicer, say, or Britain’s Got Talent breakouts Jon Courtenay and Nabil Abdulrashid. Assuming that we return to a degree of normality, all will embark on their maiden UK tours in 2021. BL The year the PS5 and Series X consoles take offThe new consoles have not yet been tested, but 2021 will bring games that really push those powerful graphical engines. PlayStation 5 gets Gran Turismo 7, the latest title in its acclaimed driving sim series, and sci-fi adventure Horizon Forbidden West, while Xbox boasts shooter epic Halo Infinite and Everwild, the latest genre-defying quest from Sea of Thieves creator Rare.Retromania galoreFor such a tech-focused industry, video games sure do love the past. And 2021 will see not one but three nostalgic hardware launches: Intellivision Amico (15 April), which revives the 40-year-old console; Playdate, a handheld games machine with a wind-up handle; and the gorgeous Analogue Pocket, which looks like an iPhone but runs thousands of Game Boy and Game Boy Advance titles.The year of dark futures It is not surprising given the state of the world, but this year sees a lot of big new games about dystopian futures. Assassin shooter Deathloop (21 May), spooky apocalypse actioner Ghostwire: Tokyo and the psychological horror Returnal (19 March) are all intriguing games about terrible things to come. Then there’s Gotham Knights, a Batman game set – wait for it – after the death of Batman. Cheer up, it might never happen. KS"
"It appears the mute button is becoming harder to find these days. Hollywood is now rallying its support for an actor who posted a video of an excruciatingly awkward Zoom encounter he had with a director who witheringly criticized his “tiny apartment” without realizing he hadn’t muted his microphone. Lukas Gage, best known for his role on HBO’s Euphoria, posted a video on Twitter yesterday of him preparing for an audition over Zoom. “Psa if you’re a shit-talking director make sure to mute ur shit on zoom meetings,” Gage wrote when posting the video. At the start of the clip, which has racked up more than 4m views, Gage is fixing his hair when a voice with a British accent quips: “These poor people live in these tiny apartments like I’m looking at his, you know, background and he’s got his TV and his, you know …” Gage, smiling, tells the director: “I know it’s a shitty apartment. That’s why give me this job so I can get a better one.” When the director apologizes, Gage adds: “I’m living in a four-by-four box, it’s fine, just give me the job and we’ll be fine.”  “I’m mortified,” the director says as someone starts to laugh in the background. The identity of the director is unknown, but Gage has received unanimous support from colleagues in Hollywood for how he handled the encounter. “Classy response Lukas,” wrote the actor January Jones in an Instagram comment. “DM me who it was so I can make note not to ever work with that person.” The actor Kevin McHale thanked Gage on Twitter for posting the clip. “Actors have to walk out on the plank and be open and vulnerable in an audition and too often the people on the other side have zero regard for what it takes and how personal it is,” he wrote. “As a young man I would have dreamed of an apartment like this one. Look at that sweet flat screen! A guitar! The moldings!” the director Judd Apatow wrote on Twitter."
"Substack is best known as the newsletter platform that lured several well-known writers and journalists away from established news outlets this year. Glenn Greenwald, Matthew Yglesias and Andrew Sullivan, formerly of the Intercept, Vox Media and New York Magazine respectively, have all jumped ship to sell their work directly to subscribers via the service. Incorporating elements of Mailchimp and Patreon, Substack has variously been hailed as the future of the media industry, a home for writers who don’t want to be edited, and a place where those who have already made a name for themselves find success. The site boasts more than 100,000 niche newsletters about every subject imaginable. Below is a small selection of some of the best, compiled from the recommendations of friends, colleagues, random tweets and my own sleuthing. Note: not all Substacks require payment – some are free, while others offer a mix of free and paid content. Insight is the creation of Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and author who writes about how technology “interacts with the fabric of society” for the Atlantic and the New York Times. Her first Substack missive was an astute analysis of why the tradition of televised debates between presidential candidates in US elections is no longer fit for purpose – particularly in the era of Donald Trump – due to “cultural lag”: Later instalments explore why randomised trials could not prove mask-wearing was effective in preventing Covid-19 transmission, mistrust in elections and the trade-offs in deciding how and when people are vaccinated. All of it is good. If you prefer lighter newsletter fare, Guardian Australia’s culture editor, Steph Harmon, recommends Ryan Broderick’s newsletter Garbage Day. “He does these deep dives into new memes and viral happenings, investigates the origins and evolution of old ones, and scans across all other matters of weird online ephemera, if you’re into that sort of thing, which I am, very much,” she says. Here’s a snippet from a recent newsletter in which Broderick dives into, among other things, extremist internet communities that have begun leaving mainstream social networks such as Reddit: I know almost nothing about the ¡Hola Papi! Substack beyond a single post I came across via Twitter, but it was a post of such perfection that I am recommending it wholesale. (¡Hola Papi! says it started out as an advice column at Grindr’s LGBTQ outlet INTO in 2017 and is being turned into a memoir to be published by Simon & Schuster next year.) The post in question is titled “Top 5 Rat Movies I Made Up” and it’s written by John Paul Brammer, who is the brains behind ¡Hola Papi!. Brammer canvasses “the nonexistent rat movies in my head based on the Rotten Tomatoes score I’m pretty sure they would have gotten if they’d been executed faithfully to my vision”. Please enjoy this excerpt: My friend Josh Nicholas is an NBA tragic and in the interests of branching out beyond my own narrow interests, I present you with one of his favourite Substacks: Truehoop. “Truehoop is one of the original sports blogs, and writer Henry Abbott has seemingly met everyone,” Josh says. “Little anecdotes puncture his stories, reminding you that behind the NBA’s plays, glamour and stats are real people and some weird situations. One week it’s an exploration into a team owner’s alleged mob ties, another it’s the problem with a basketball shoe marketing machine that is largely aimed at poor communities. There has never been more incredible sports writing being published, and Truehoop itself surfaces a lot of it, but I don’t know of anyone else that so consistently shows sports isn’t just about sports.” Here’s a small taste of The sneaker industry paradox: Before Letters of Note was a Substack it was a blog, a book (or two) and a live show, but the concept is the same. As writer Shaun Usher explains, it’s basically a bunch of emails in which he chats about letters. I’ve been a longtime fan because I, too, love letters. Here’s an excerpt of a letter Virginia Woolf wrote to Violet Dickinson on 28 December 1906: The moral of this story is that Substack is full of great stuff and if you don’t like anything I included in my list, you could probably find something on it that you do."
"Are the bad guys winning? For a hellish moment that felt like the situation in both reality and pop culture. Never mind a harried hero defusing a nuclear bomb at the last second; in the age of Mindhunter, audiences are apparently more interested in analysing what makes evil-doers tick. You see it in Angelina Jolie’s ravishingly wicked Maleficent movies, or TV deep dives into knotty psychologies like Hannibal, Ratched or the soon-to-be-revived Dexter. It has become so normalised that Lucifer – the actual devil! – gets to headline his own slick, self-satisfied procedural.  In this morally complex landscape where we all seem to be reassessing what it means to be “good” or “evil”, reducing a villain to a random shopping list of character traits and cliches might feel like something of a step backwards. But until film and TV production is safely back up and running, this random bad guy generator is probably the best you are going to get. Just select a random six-digit sequence of numbers from one to six, then run that personalised doomsday code through the generator to create a memorable foe. So if you scribbled down 111121 – which adds up to 007, incidentally – you would get in-demand rotter Ben Mendelsohn as a bald military blowhard threatening world governments with a giant satellite laser (with the help of a Google-style tech support team). His only weakness? Banging on about his own genius for too long. Think of it as choosing your own misadventure: if it all works out, the results will be truly diabolical … 1. Bloodthirsty military warmonger 2. Empathy-free zillionaire who wants it all 3. Rat-bag Machiavellian puppet master 4. Fastidious, polite cannibal and/or necrophile 5. Sentient AI murder bot 6. An almost exact mirror image of your hero but they broke bad, like a whole nature/nurture thing, yeah? 1. Humourless black ops beefcakes with scraggly beards and sleeve tattoos 2.

"The creators of the show Hedwig and the Angry Inch have weighed in to a casting row that led to the producers of an upcoming Australian production pulling the show from January’s Sydney festival. In a statement on Wednesday, John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Task said they did not believe the title role was a trans character, and the role should be “open to anyone who can tackle it and, more importantly, anyone who needs it.” The January festival announced the postponement of rock musical and seminal queer show on Tuesday, following a flood of complaints over the casting of a cis male as Hedwig. The Packed to the Rafters actor Hugh Sheridan was announced to be playing the complex genderqueer character in early November. Sheridan, who revealed in October that he has been with men and women but eschews labels when it comes to sexual orientation, was to become the latest in a long line of queer cis men to play the role, including its creator Mitchell. The actor who launched a petition that led to Sydney festival’s cancellation of Hedwig and the Angry Inch spoke out on Wednesday about why they believe “it’s time to make change happen” when it comes to casting transgender roles. Since launching a social media campaign on Monday, Daya Czepanski has collected more than 1,700 signatories expressing the transgender community’s “profound sadness and disappointment” over the casting of “a cisgender male as a transgender character”. “[This] is offensive and damaging to the trans community, and continues to cause genuine distress and frustration amongst trans and gender non conforming performers all across Australia,” the open letter posted on Instagram said. It called on the show’s producer and the Sydney festival to “rectify this casting choice” by casting a transgender actor in the title role, employing “trans advocates on the [Sydney festival] creative team”, and including “trans advisors and talent” in the Hedwig production. Czepanski, a 2018 NIDA graduate who identifies as trans non-binary and recently established the Queer Artist Alliance, told Guardian Australia on Wednesday that the intention behind the campaign was not to scuttle the show. “It’s not about cancel culture,” Czepanski said, from their Covid-19 quarantine hotel in Christchurch, New Zealand. “It’s just about bringing an awareness that systemic change needs to happen from the ground up, and if we can fix the root cause of the problem we can work towards a healthy environment for non-cis trans artists. “People in positions of power in Australia need to take a leap of faith and allow trans, non binary and gender queer to tell their stories on the Australian stage. “I don’t have all the clear answers; it’s a developing conversation, but it’s a conversation that needs to happen,” they continued. “It’s time to make change happen, and we can’t use the past as an excuse to not make that change.” On Tuesday, the Sydney festival director, Wesley Enoch, was notified by the show’s producer David M Hawkins of his decision to postpone the production. Hawkins then released a statement saying “in light of recent community conversations and concerns, we have made the difficult decision to postpone” the Sydney festival season of the show.  He went on to say the production had “auditioned a wide, diverse range of performers”, and no one from any background had been excluded from the auditioning process. “We wish to assure the trans and LGBTQIA+ community that the issues raised are respected and taken very seriously,” the statement said, adding that the producers needed more time to “properly consider these concerns and respond accordingly”. The Sydney festival confirmed the show’s postponement on Twitter, saying it supported the producer’s decision.  “Sydney festival is an important platform, and we have a responsibility to use this platform in a way that is beneficial to all members of the community,” the post said. “We also recognise our responsibility to actively address concerns that are not in alignment with out values.” Both Hawkins and the festival declined to elaborate further on Wednesday. Sheridan has been approached for comment via his agent.  The show’s creators have always maintained that because Hedwig does not freely choose a trans life – she is coerced into a sex change operation as part of a plan to escape East Berlin – the role does not have to be played by a trans actor. “Though we’ve always been so pleased to hear trans folks find resonance in the character’s journey to find his/herself, it’s really through drag and performance that Hedwig does so, creating a persona that is ‘more than a woman or a man’ and making ‘something beautiful and new’ out of trauma,” they said in the statement on Wednesday. “Drag is a mask available to all and that’s why anyone should be able to play Hedwig.” “Hedwig was forced into kind of an accidental trans state by political and by patriarchal pressures,” Mitchell told Buzzfeed in 2018. “I’ve seen trans people [play] it, I’ve seen female people do it … the feelings and the ideas are more important than the attributes of the person playing it physically or age-wise.” On Tuesday the Hungry Ghosts actor Suzy Wrong – a signatory to the petition – told Melbourne’s LGBTQI+ community radio station JOY 94.9 that while the postponement of the production may have represented an “overcorrection”, the petition was an overdue challenge to the accepted norm – of more than two decades – that a cis gay man was the most logical choice when casting the character. “We are in a different time now, and we are trying to find a way to have these discussions,” she said. “At the moment, everything is a lightning rod ... every time there’s a mis-step it becomes a lightning rod and trans people, trans performers, trans artists like myself, we will take the opportunity to attack it and say ‘let’s have this conversation now’ and ‘I’ll tell you why it is wrong’.”"
"“It’s been five days since it became clear that Joe Biden won the election,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show, “at which point the current president refused to concede, duct-taped himself to the resolute desk and slapped a sign on the Oval Office door that says ‘No Dems Aloud.’” Over a week since the polls closed, and days since all major American networks, including Trump’s beloved Fox News, declared Joe Biden the next president of the United States, Donald Trump has still refused to concede the election. “He’s like a toddler too hopped up on sugar to go to bed,” Colbert joked. “There’s no reasoning with him at this point, you just have to let him tire himself out, wait until he falls asleep on the kitchen floor and hope he hasn’t conspired with the dog to stage a coup.” While Trump’s refusal to acknowledge his defeat has material consequences for the Biden transition team, the president-elect’s staff is not too concerned about the Trump campaign’s efforts to undermine the results, reportedly viewing its PR and legal efforts as a “comedy of errors”. “Yes, it’s just like Shakespeare,” Colbert deadpanned. “The president’s fraud claims are much ado about nothing, because he’s pulling out these accusations of fraud right out of his Coriolanus.” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee celebrated Biden’s victory, but warned that Trump and his base are far from over and done. “While it will be nice to see the Secret Service drag Trump out of office, the president is leaving behind a wave of white resentment and disinformation,” she said. “Plus, out of spite, Trump is probably gonna upper-deck all the toilets in the West Wing.” “As much as we’d like to think that a Biden presidency will instantly solve America’s problems, Trump will still exist and so will the base he fired up,” she added. “He’s also leaving enough filet-o-fish wrappers on the White House lawn that kids can jump in them like a pile of majestic autumn leaves.” “Trump’s more ardent supporters are mad as hell and they aren’t going away,” Bee said, pointing to protests in several swing states in which Trump supporters chanted both “stop the count!” in Philadelphia and “count the votes!” in Arizona. Trump isn’t going anywhere, either – “he is an ageing, bitter, fame-hungry personality who craves the spotlight more than anything,” Bee explained. “The best we can hope for is that he’ll go on Dancing with the Stars and get lifted by his partner with so much force it shoots him into space.” Still, “there’s a lot to celebrate right now,” she concluded. “We have a chance to reverse four years of an administration that ruled with cruelty, deceit and dangerous misinformation. But we have to stay vigilant, because Trumpism isn’t going away any time soon.” “It has now been four – or possibly 12? – days since Joe Biden was declared president-elect and Kamala Harris’s sassy white friend,” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show, and yet America’s “tenant-from-hell”, Donald Trump, still had not conceded the election – a choice Joe Biden called an “embarrassment” that “will not help the president’s legacy” in a speech on Monday. “Joe Biden is right,” Noah said. “Does Donald Trump really want denying the election results to be his legacy? Because I’d like to remember him as the president who kidnapped kids and helped kill 240,000 Americans, not for this. “Everyone around Trump knows he lost, but they’ve gotta all go along with the lie,” Noah added of reports that Trump had instructed his staff to prepare a budget and interview new hires for a non-existent second term. “That’s got to be exhausting, especially when you’re already running a fever from Covid.” Biden was also right, Noah continued, in that Trump’s refusal to concede amounted to an embarrassment. “Donald Trump has never looked more pathetic than this, and yes I’m including the time he played tennis in his sport diapers,” Noah said. “Because the only way he could overturn the election is to prove that there has been nationwide voter fraud, and the truth is that’s just not panning out,” as no issues of substantive or widespread voter fraud have been reported. The New York Times and AP called election officials in every state; none reported any cases of widespread voter fraud. In other words, “everyone knows Donald Trump lost. Even Trump knows that he lost,” said Noah. How did he know? Because Trump hasn’t been seen in public since Saturday, when Biden was declared the winner. “You think that if Donald Trump really thought he’d won he’d be hiding? No. We know this guy,” said Noah. “This guy would be holding a victory rally every single day. He’d be flying around the country on top of Air Force One doing that weird jerk-off dance that he does.”"
"Just before her appointment as the new director and CEO of the Australian Museum became public knowledge in 2014, Kim McKay sat anonymously in the Sydney museum’s cafe drinking coffee. “It was just inside the building’s main entrance, and I remember thinking, the first thing that hits people when they come inside [the museum] is the overwhelming smell of greasy hot chips,” she says. “I thought to myself, ‘Oh my god, all this has to change ... everything is so worn, and I’m going to fix it.’” On Saturday, after a 15-month major facelift, the Australian Museum will reopen its doors to the public. The transformation of the 193 year-old building is what McKay calls her long-running labour of love, turning a cluttered and chaotic series of cramped spaces, groaning under the weight of past architectural and interior design crimes, into a sleek, light-filled institution aesthetically displaying a carefully curated fraction of the museum’s enormous collection. More than 3,000sq metres of new public space has been added in the process. Even the new cloakroom is a design triumph, the walls of the formerly dank basement pared back and scrubbed clean to their original creamy sandstone, hand-hewn by convicts almost 200 years ago. The project, which closed the museum last August, comes with a $57.5m price tag. Uncovering and restoring the vast building’s heritage sandstone bones cost $3m alone. The New South Wales government stumped up $50m and the museum raised the remainder, largely through the courting of philanthropists, who are acknowledged in the naming of the museum’s two largest new spaces – the Hintze Hall (the Hintze Family Charitable Foundation) and the Brian Sherman Crystal Hall. Sydney-based arts doyens Brian and Gene Sherman donated $1m to the rejuvenation project. The cafe McKay made her vows in six years ago has been demolished, and a sleek new eatery has been installed on the building’s rooftop. But the chips have remained stubbornly on the menu. On Saturday, McKay will tick off another item on the to-do list she created upon her appointment six years ago. When the museum opens its doors, the public will enter free of charge. And that, she says, is “a real game-changer”. To make the plan financially viable, the museum sent its most successful major exhibitions packing: Spiders – Alive and Deadly exhibition has generated revenue of $1.5m while touring through the US and Canada over the past three years; Tyrannosaurs – Meet the Family has earned $2.5m during its five year tour across North America. The latter has returned home to become the new-look museum’s first special ticketed exhibition. The enduring fascination with dinosaurs by children and adults alike has much to do with their fantasy-as-fact appeal, says Matthew McCurry, the museum’s vertebrate palaeontologist and functional morphologist. “People are excited by dragons, they are excited by aliens in outer space … but the difference with dinosaurs is that yes, they part of another world but this stuff is real. “We have the bones, we can look for evidence and build this understanding of what that world that looked like that was so different from today.”"
"Naaman, I have often dreamed of amassing obscene wealth with a minimum of labour or talent. Are my dreams likely to remain unfulfilled? Hi Stuart. You have two options – buy a house 10 to 20 years ago in Sydney, or grab a rod and catch one very special fish. Under a (not confirmed) new proposal designed to boost tourism, an alliance of Sydney harbourside businesses are thinking of starting a fishing competition along that iconic shore. One kingfish will be released into Sydney Harbour and tagged with a million-dollar reward. If you catch it, the money is yours. Other fish will be released with smaller prizes of $5,000 and $10,000. The million dollar fish is only one idea, floated as part of a new “Sydney Harbour festival”, and designed by the Western Harbour Alliance. The chairman of the alliance, Geoff Parmenter, said: “These kind of events can really kickstart Sydney’s recovery from the Covid pandemic.” Is there a chance that the fish, once released, will swim away and never be seen again? I’d say yes. Fish famously have no respect for the rules and conditions of NSW tourism campaigns. Our wealthy piscine could simply scarper, with its $1m tag still attached, and maybe live out the rest of its life on some tropical island. In fact, the Northern Territory government has run a nearly-identical million dollar fish campaign – called Million Dollar Fish. Over five years, that million dollar fish has never been caught. A spokesman for the Western Harbour Alliance told Guardian Australia: “It is unlikely that the fish would be kept in a certain area. It may indeed, therefore, leave the harbour.” Won’t that $1m be missed? Hopefully not. The plan is that this event will generate more revenue for the state than will be lost through the catching of the fish. The fish hunt is also only one event in a broader plan for a harbour festival. Sydney’s Daily Telegraph reported glowingly that “it is hoped the festival would rival Vivid, which attracts 3 million visitors and generates $172m a year, or Sculpture by the Sea, which attracts 450,000 visitors and pumps $40m into the economy.” A second Daily Telegraph article on the same fish hunt said that organisers expected it to generate $7m – but a Western Harbour Alliance spokesman said this was an error. They’re not willing to put a number on this yet. It’s not my job to judge whether 3 million visitors and $172m is a realistic aim for a primarily fish-based festival, but hey, you have to consider it. Especially if our million-dollar fish is never caught. Think of the profit margin! Is there a risk that, once the fish is released, hordes of Sydneysiders will descend on the area and begin flinging explosives into the ocean in an attempt to make their fortune? Organisers told Guardian Australia that “very preliminary target audiences” are “set indicatively” at 100,000. But that includes people visiting sculpture and art installations and food stalls as well. “Estimates of participation in each element, including the fishing, would be made as part of detailed event planning, should the event be progressed,” a spokesman said. However, once it dethrones Vivid, I would definitely be worried. Prepare for a Simpsons-esque city-wide scramble to secure Molloy the cat burglar’s treasure. But isn’t this irresponsible? Don’t we need as many fish in the sea as possible? A spokesman for the Western Harbour Alliance assured me that “sustainability and safety would be key planks of the event”. That is again, only in the event that “the event be progressed”. So please put away that dynamite-loaded lure of yours and get back to earning excessive amounts of money the traditional way – consulting."
"Three weeks clear of the election and with the formal transition of power finally underway, Seth Meyers looked ahead to calmer news cycles of the future on Monday night. “One thing I’m definitely not going to miss about the Trump era is the Mad-libs style news reporting,” the Late Night host said. “Another thing I won’t miss is trying to follow the rotating cast of fringe rightwing weirdos who come in and out of the Trump world,” such as the conspiracy-peddling figures on the Trump legal team led by Rudy Giuliani. Last week, the former mayor of New York City held a press conference in Philadelphia peddling lies about voter fraud while dark droplets – seemingly brown hair dye mixed with sweat – dripped from his temples. “Rudy dyed his hair frantically in a bathroom like Richard Kimball in The Fugitive,” Meyers joked. “I mean, if I saw that coming out of my radiator I would be pounding on my super’s door.” Giuliani and his team are “the only people Trump has left, because no legitimate lawyer wants to be part of this unhinged assault on American democracy”, Meyers continued, pointing to reports that most of Trump’s legal team has quit. “At this point, the Trump legal team is like CVS at midnight – sure, they’re ‘open,’ but nobody actually works there.” Meyers zeroed in on one especially fringe figure: Sidney Powell, “by far the craziest addition to the Trump Cinematic Universe,” a lawyer who spent the weekend floating a truly unhinged conspiracy theory that involved Georgia governor and Trump ally Brian Kemp, the CIA, and Venezuela’s deceased president, Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013, in a plot against the president. “If you thought Rudy was bonkers, this lady is crazier than a cereal mascot,” Meyers said. Her theories sans any evidence spooked even the president’s staunchest allies on Fox News, who pressed her with questions when she promised, as she said on Lou Dobbs’s show, to “release the Kraken”. “I guess the only Kraken we ended up seeing was in Rudy Giuliani’s hair dye,” Meyers retorted. “They have no evidence, which is why lawyers keep quitting or getting fired or laughed out of court, because this whole thing isn’t actually about evidence. It’s about manufacturing a conspiracy theory that will animate Trump’s base for years to come. It’s just another scam.” The Late Show taped just after Emily Murphy, head of the General Services Administration, “ascertained” the election result and initiated the formal transition process to President-elect Joe Biden. “So it is official, our next commander in chief will be President Biden,” said Stephen Colbert. “Which means somewhere right now, Rudy Giuliani is filing a last ditch legal claim that our current president’s legal name has always been Joe Biden.” In another blow to Trump’s disintegrating attempt to overturn the election results, Georgia officials completed a hand recount of the entire state to confirm that Joe Biden won – “so the president saw the writing on the wall, and graciously…asked Georgia for another recount,” Colbert deadpanned. “He wants them to recount the recount? Mr President, things don’t necessarily get better when you ask for a do-over. Look at Eric.” Colbert also touched on the president’s attempt to distance himself from Powell, whose conspiracy theories on Trump’s election loss were outrageous enough to merit skepticism from Fox News host and reliable Trump conspiracy peddler Tucker Carlson. Even Giuliani attempted to distance himself from Powell, releasing a statement claiming “Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own” and that she is “not a member of the Trump Legal Team”. “Yes, she doesn’t work for them at all, it’s just a coincidence that during Giuliani’s two-hour press conference, she was on stage the entire time,” Colbert said, with photo evidence. “It’s a simple mix-up! They invited Sidney Powell but they meant to invite Sidney Powell Total Landscaping.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the twentieth day of “Squattergate,” in which “we still haven’t seen the president concede. We’ve barely even seen the president.” The president once again had no public events on Monday – “just some eating and some private screaming into a MyPillow” on the docket, Kimmel joked – after a weekend of golf. Still, “I’ve never seen a guy try so hard to keep a job he doesn’t even do,” Kimmel said, as on Friday, Trump “tried to interfere in the election personally” by inviting Michigan’s Senate majority leader and speaker of the House, both Republicans, to the White House for some “bigly buttering up”. The plying didn’t work; on Monday, Michigan’s board of canvassers certified the state’s election result, once again confirming Joe Biden as the nation’s 46th president. Kimmel also touched on Powell and her fear-mongering that Kemp was bribed by a voting machine company to throw the election to the Biden. “I guess that was too much even for Donald Trump, because a week after he welcomed Sidney Powell to what he described as a ‘truly great legal team,’ the campaign put out a statement saying ‘Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own,’” Kimmel explained. “It’s a real CrackerJack team of attorneys he put together here, in that he appears to actually have found them in boxes of CrackerJacks.”"
"The ska-era Wailers launch themselves into the 60s Jamaican vogue for singles either praising or condemning the violent Kingston “rude boy” youth cult. Tellingly, given the socio-political songs that lay ahead of him, Marley focuses on the deprived circumstances that birthed the phenomenon: “Want it want it – can’t get it, get it get it – no want it.” Selassie Is the Chapel is like nothing else Marley recorded, in effect a doo-wop song given a Rastafarian twist. It is set to a lo-fi backing consisting of noticeably out-of-tune guitar and drums, which only serves to make the Wailers’ high harmonies more powerful. It’s both faintly creepy and fabulous. Marley was not initially convinced by punk, but eventually recognised the denizens of the Roxy as kindred spirits – “rejected by society” – and threw in his lot on the exuberant Punky Reggae Party, which namechecks the Clash and the Damned and promises “no boring old farts will be there” at the titular event. There’s something genuinely thrilling about the way Exodus’s opening track slowly creeps into view – it takes a full 30 seconds to fade in – and something chilling about its mood, the lyrical references to Revelation and insistence that “many more will have to suffer, many more will have to die”. Producer Chris Blackwell might have sweetened their sound for white ears, but you could never accuse the Wailers themselves of sugaring their message. Exhibit A: Catch a Fire opener Concrete Jungle’s powerfully bleak reportage, allegedly written not about Kingston’s ghettoes, but Marley’s mid-60s stay in the US. The Wailers were always musically open-minded – in the 60s they covered everything from Bacharach and David to the Archies’ Sugar Sugar, while 1971’s Lick Samba dabbled in Latin-American music. Could You Be Loved?, meanwhile, allied Marley’s sharp pop instinct to disco, with backing vocalists the I-Threes on particularly fine form. Marley’s pre-Island discography can be baffling – umpteen releases, umpteen labels – but the 00s box sets Fy-ah Fy-ah, Man to Man and Grooving Kingston 12 do a good job of sorting through it, revealing gems such as Caution: an odd, tremulous lead guitar, eerie harmonies on the chorus and a winning refrain of “hit me from the top, you crazy mother-funky”. Marley’s great musical inspiration was Curtis Mayfield – the young Wailers even copied the Impressions’ poses in photos. It’s tempting to call Johnny Was his answer to Mayfield’s Freddie’s Dead: an empathic examination of an accidental death (“from a stray bullet”) that nevertheless has wider implications, the lushness of the harmonies at odds with the lyrics. Smile Jamaica was the theme song for the Kingston concert that almost got Marley killed – he was shot by gunmen two days before the gig. It’s tempting to suggest the track itself is oddly prescient: despite the title, there’s something brooding and overcast about its sound, as if Marley didn’t quite have faith in the sentiment the lyrics were supposed to be espousing. Recorded at the first Wailers session following Marley’s return to Jamaica from his mid-60s sojourn in America, Freedom Time is audibly influenced by the music he heard in the US – there’s a distinct hint of the Impressions’ civil rights anthem People Get Ready about the lyric – and a total delight: piano-led rocksteady with a beautiful descending melody. As stark and potent as late 70s Marley got, War dispenses with standard verse-chorus structure and any semblance of lyrical poetry. The music exists as an austere backdrop for words taken from a Haile Selassie speech: “Until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned, everywhere is war.” Marley recorded several versions of One Love – it began life as a ska track in 1965 – but the version on Exodus, interpolated with People Get Ready, is definitive. Its contemporary role as jolly soundtrack to umpteen Jamaican tourist ads overlooks the fire and brimstone aspect of the lyrics. Usually taken as a metaphorical song about colonialism, there seems every chance that the defiant Small Axe was, at heart, actually about the Wailers’ perennially volatile relationship with the Jamaican music industry. The re-recording on Burnin’ beats the Lee Perry original – slightly slower, with lovely backing vocals courtesy of Peter Tosh. Of all the tracks the Wailers cut with Perry in the early 70s, the title track of their December 1970 album feels the most forward-looking. It would be a brilliant song however it was produced, but its bass-heavy sound makes it feel like something from far later in the decade. His 1979 LP Survival was Marley’s most politically militant statement, its preoccupation with pan-Africanism reflected not just in the lyrics of Top Rankin’ (“They don’t want to see us unite … all they want us to do is keep killing one another”) but its sound: the horns carry more than a hint of Fela Kuti about them. Marley frequently reworked old material during the 70s, but the version of Sun Is Shining (a song apparently inspired by Eleanor Rigby, of all things) on 1978’s Kaya is dwarfed by the 1971 version produced by Perry: minimal, bass-heavy, gloomier-sounding than the lyric suggests, with Tosh’s melodica snaking around Marley’s voice. Jamming is Marley at his most genial and pop-facing, but the music that underpins the charming tune is surprisingly tough. Check out the instrumental and dub versions appended to the deluxe edition of Exodus for proof of what a fantastic rhythm section the Wailers boasted. After the departure of Tosh and Bunny Wailer, Marley came out swinging on 1974’s Natty Dread. Any fears the Wailers might be diminished were dispelled by the simmering tension of Them Belly Full, its invocation to “forget your troubles and dance” tempered by its ominous warning: “A hungry mob is an angry mob.” Co-written by Perry, Duppy Conqueror’s Louie Louie-esque groove seems to commemorate producer Joe Higgs’s unique method of curing the Wailers’ stage fright by making them rehearse in graveyards. “If you’re not afraid fe sing fe duppy [ghosts],” explained Wailer, “the audience can’t frighten you.” The high, shivering vocal interjections add a suitably uncanny ambience. Natty Dread’s opening track is a reggae equivalent of Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay: a chest-out espousal of the genre’s virtues that seems aimed, as much as at anyone, at the white audience Island Records was trying to bring to Marley. The incredible audience-assisted version on 1975’s Live! feels like a mutual explosion of glee. A lot of Exodus tended to the mellow, but the strength of its title track comes from a relentless urgency. Exodus is built around a riff that stays the same for the best part of eight minutes. Its final 60 seconds are the nearest the 70s Wailers albums got to dub. Slave Driver and Tosh’s superb 400 Years are the toughest moments on Catch a Fire. “Every time I hear a crack of a whip, my blood runs cold,” sings Marley, capturing the song’s emotional temperature. For all its rage, it is icy too – with a sense of certainty that “the table is turned” and its targets are in hell. Leaving aside the intriguing question of how Marley got his wife, Rita, to sing backing vocals on a song about his mistress Cindy Breakspeare, Turn Your Lights Down Low is an exquisite love song. Hovering somewhere between reggae and a soul ballad, its melody is gorgeous, while the slide guitar and – yes – the backing vocals are beautifully done. Eric Clapton’s hit cover drew greater attention to Marley as a songwriter, but its slick funk isn’t a patch on the Wailers’ cop-baiting original, lacking its falsetto vocals, reedy organ line and the terrific breakdown with its echoing vocal – “If I am guilty I must pay!” – and funk-inspired clavinet. Kaya is by some distance the least well-regarded of Marley’s 70s albums, a lightweight filling sandwiched between hit-packed Exodus and the fiery Survival, but its big hit is irresistible, evidence of one of Marley’s less exalted skills, as a masterful pop craftsman piling one fantastic melodic hook on top of the other. Blessed with one of the all-time great opening lines – “One good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain” – the original Perry-produced Trenchtown Rock was one of 24 singles the Wailers released in 1971. Its elated shout-out to the Kingston neighbourhood that gave birth to reggae stayed in Marley’s live set for the rest of his career. Rita has suggested Marley knew he was dying when he recorded Uprising; certainly, its closing track provided his musical epitaph. There’s a full band version of Redemption Song, but it has none of the acoustic take’s raw impact. Closer to folk than reggae, alternately brooding and exultant, it remains moving despite its subsequent omnipresence. Gorgeous evidence both of the debt the Wailers owed American soul music and that Blackwell’s controversial decision to overdub Catch a Fire’s tracks using UK and US session musicians yielded dividends. John Bundrick’s synth is a perfect addition to the stunning, airy harmonies, augmenting the song’s heavy-lidded, blissful, post-coital mood. As with John Lennon, canonisation has done Marley few favours. Rather than the benign patron saint of potheads and beach bars represented by the trite but wildly popular Three Little Birds, it’s better to remember him as the co-author of Get Up Stand Up, a militant, righteously pissed off call to arms that has lost none of its urgency. People who saw the Wailers’ 1975 shows at the Lyceum in London talk about them in awed terms: the subsequent live album suggests they’re right. The studio version of No Woman No Cry is fine, but the live take – longer, slower, sadder, the drum machine replaced by Carlton Barrett’s astonishing playing – elevates the song. It’s a raw recording by modern standards (a bum note of feedback rings out at 1min 47sec), but from the moment the audience take up the chorus’s refrain before the band do, it feels luminous and utterly magical, the intensity of its emotional twists and turns – from melancholy nostalgia to optimism – potentiated."
"The national embarrassment Jimmy Kimmel has termed “Squattergate” – Donald Trump’s refusal to acknowledge Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election and facilitate the transition of power – sputtered along on Tuesday evening, the day before the deadline for the Trump campaign to request a recount in Wisconsin. The recount for a state Biden won by over 20,000 votes would cost the Trump campaign $8m, “which is why he’s asking his supporters for $16m – a little walking around money on the side,” Kimmel joked. “The only way Wisconsin is getting $8m from Donald Trump is if it has sex with him 63 times.” Meanwhile, “the president’s minions are working hard right now to poison the well,” Kimmel continued, such as the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who, in a phone call over the weekend, pressured Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to throw out legally cast ballots in certain counties, according to Raffensperger. Graham is “one of many Republicans who still refuse to acknowledge publicly that Joe Biden won the election”, Kimmel explained. “Behind the scenes, though, it’s a different story.” On the Senate floor on Tuesday, Graham gave a congratulatory fist bump and pat to Kamala Harris. “It’s almost as if Lindsey Graham is an unscrupulous opportunist who blows whichever way the wind goes.” Finally, Biden reportedly told advisers this week that he doesn’t want his presidency consumed by investigations into Trump’s corruption. “Which is big of him,” said Kimmel, “but what about what I want? I at least want a mugshot out of this. I want to see Trump in a jumpsuit that matches his skin.” “Two weeks to the day since the election and I’m beginning to breathe easier,” said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show. “It’s like I’ve had this weight lifted off my chest. Doctors say it was 239lb, but it sure felt heavier.” Meanwhile, in Washington, “the president is slowly, agonizingly going through the five stages of narcissistic grief: denial, denial, denial, denial, denial and denial. I know that’s six, but Rudy [Giuliani] is demanding a recount.” The denial continues even as the Trump campaign’s legal strategy against the election falls apart, with cases dropped this week in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin. “To be clear: ‘dropped.’ Those are withdrawn cases. They didn’t even lose them – they pre-lost them. That’s like coming in last in the Indy 500 because you decided not to buy a car.” And on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah condemned the Trump administration’s reckless messaging on gatherings for Thanksgiving as cases surge and hospitals across the nation prepare to be overrun, if they’re not overstretched already. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist who somehow serves as Trump’s adviser on infectious diseases, told Fox News isolation of the elderly should outweigh Covid concerns for large, intergenerational groups – “for many people, this is their final Thanksgiving, believe it or not,” Atlas said. “I think we have to have a policy, which I have been advocating, which is a whole person, whole health policy.” “This dude can’t be serious,” said Noah. “‘For many people this will be their final Thanksgiving?’ I mean, yes, thanks to the Trump administration, there’s definitely going to be many people’s final Thanksgiving, but still. “If you get corona, that’s the ‘whole’ thing,” he added. “It’s not like you’re gonna say ‘well, I died of Covid, but damn those mashed potatoes were great.’” While it’s of course important for people to see their families, Noah continued, “it’s more important to be able to see you family for the next 10 Thanksgivings – they’ll hopefully get to be with you in person after all of this is done. “It’s so hilarious that conservatives have ended up here,” he added. “Because when this pandemic started, you remember, they said ‘we don’t need to shut down the economy, just be safe and responsible.’ Then they were like ‘we don’t have to wear masks to protect the elderly.’ Now they’re like ‘you know what, bring the elderly in here, I can’t fit all those leftovers in my fridge.’” The shifting, groundless messaging “just doesn’t make sense”, Noah concluded. “It doesn’t make sense why Trump is willing to risk old people being exposed to corona this much – unless he thinks that it will end up making him look good in the long run, because you won’t have old people dying if all the old people are already dead.”"
"Michael, Scottie, Dennis, Phil and Steve. Like the members of a new, wildly popular boyband, these names are permanently etched in my mind after viewing the Netflix sports docuseries The Last Dance. Despite complete ignorance of anything remotely to do with sports and only newly sentient at the age of three when the events of the series take place, the Michael Jordan-produced show has proved to be one of the most addictive viewing experiences of the year, channelling the fast-paced unpredictability of basketball, launching a thousand memes and provoking high-profile backlash from some of those featured – as well as a spate of new fashion inspirations. Telling the story of Jordan’s final season with the seemingly unbeatable Chicago Bulls from 1997 to 98, intercut with footage of his rapid ascension to become one of the greatest players of the American sport in the across the previous decade, the show’s premise is deceptively simple. With Jordan granted editorial control, it initially seems an egocentric hagiography on his part, a retelling of the well-trodden story of a lone hero, battling against all odds to become the champion of his chosen pursuit. Yet, from the very first shot – of present-day Jordan looking like a much-loved sofa cushion slumped in an armchair, red-eyed and permanently flanked by a tumbler of whisky – The Last Dance gives away far more than its producer had perhaps hoped. The kinetic editing – cutting back and forth between the 97/98 season, Jordan’s early career and contemporary analysis – soon highlights his own contradictions. Here is a man who fashioned himself into one of the archetypal sporting leaders, and yet he is also so fiercely competitive as to pursue rivalries to the potential detriment of his team – punching teammate Steve Kerr in practice, for instance, or refusing to intercede when key player Scottie Pippen leaves in protest at his comparatively pitiful pay. What soon becomes apparent is that Jordan might be sociopathically bent on winning at any cost, but it is a price his team is willing to pay to be able to bask in his success. It is a revealing exposition of the competitive psyche. And it isn’t as if his teammates aren’t obscenely talented too, but Jordan is so gifted and relentless that no one can hope to compare – they are the mere firmament to his central, blazing sun. The joy of The Last Dance lies in the fact that an entire follow-up could be made about Jordan’s teammates: kindly, determined Kerr, enduring baritone Pippen, heartfelt eccentric Dennis Rodman and shamanic coach Phil Jackson. Not to mention, reams of sartorial analysis on Jordan’s constantly ballooning square suits and gold hoops, Rodman’s mercurial hair and under-appreciated haute couture dressing, even Jackson’s painfully high-waisted trousers. Despite cracks in Jordan’s self-presentation allowing the fraught realities of his leadership to shine through, there are still omissions. His personal life, including a worrying fixation on gambling and a highly publicised divorce, are scrupulously avoided. And this is clearly a man’s world; leaving Jordan to feel compelled to play immediately after the murder of his father and Kerr’s inability to emotionally connect with his captain when his own father was killed. In a year full of soapy sports docuseries, such as All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur and The Test, serving as advertising as much as anything else, the distance of hindsight allows The Last Dance to be more about its people than its brands. As the thousands of hours of edited-down court-side footage shows, this is an unrelenting, adrenalised sport and in The Last Dance we witness its intoxicating effect on the players, as well as its lasting consequences after the glamour of victory has faded. Then we are left with Michael, Scottie, Dennis, Phil and Steve, older now, all chuckling at their bygone antics but still revealing their deep-seated need for recognition, to be considered the greatest."
"A quick experiment: Anthony Hopkins is one of history’s most celebrated thesps, a star of stage and screen for more than 60 years. Picture him. What do you see? Is it John Quincy Adams in Amistad? Frederick Treves in The Elephant Man? Or is it Hannibal Lecter, leering through plexiglass, theth-theth-thething into the camera? If you said it’s anything other than that last one, then congratulations. Why not pour yourself a nice glass of chianti to wash down your LIES. Of course it was Lecter. That is no slight on those other roles, either. Nor is it an insult to Javier Bardem to posit that he’ll for ever be the coin-tossing, mop-headed wrong ’un from No Country for Old Men. And Kathy Bates is a phenomenal actor, but even she must be aware that she hasn’t met anyone for 30 years who didn’t, at some point in the conversation, calculate how far she was from the nearest hammer. These actors are exceptional at what they do, yet it was that same brilliance in these roles (for which each of them won an Oscar) that turned Lecter, Anton Chigurh and Misery’s Annie Wilkes into such inescapable, career-defining figures. The real Hopkins, Bardem and Bates almost seemed like their final victims.  Why these characters in particular? Brian Cox played Lecter in Michael Mann’s Manhunter in 1986, five years before Anthony Hopkins’s adroit wine pairing for human liver in The Silence of the Lambs. Yet Hopkins’s interpretation lives on, ever-quotably, in the common consciousness. Cox’s Succession stablemate Matthew Macfadyen played the Sheriff of Nottingham in Ridley Scott’s Robin Hood. Is it Macfadyen you think of when you imagine the sheriff? Of course not. The sheriff is a lithe Alan Rickman, threatening to remove someone’s heart with a spoon, and it always will be. You might argue this is because Scott’s Robin Hood wasn’t very good. But rewatch Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and you’ll find that, besides Rickman, it’s appalling. These actors’ synonymy with villainy may appear to be an alchemic, almost accidental intersection between the perfect actor and role, but it isn’t as serendipitous as it appears. Hopkins played Lecter three times, presumably on purpose. Rickman alone is responsible for not one, not two, but three of the great baddies: the sheriff, Harry Potter’s Snape and Die Hard’s Hans Gruber. It is a deliberate, more-is-more approach pioneered by Boris Karloff in the 30s then perfected by the mighty Christopher Lee, who would cheerfully ham it up as the big evil in the majority of his 260-odd (!) films, including 10 (!!) appearances at Dracula, as well as Saruman in The Lord of the Rings, and as Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. Through a chimera of tone of voice, fortuitous evil-faced physiognomy and sheer gung-ho enthusiasm, some actors excel at playing villains, and clearly have a ball doing it. It cannot be typecasting if the actors are typecasting themselves. They also get the meatiest, showiest roles. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger’s Jokers won Oscars. Christoph Waltz bagged one for Inglourious Basterds. Louise Fletcher won best actress in 1976 as Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Daniel Day-Lewis for There Will Be Blood, Mo’Nique for Precious, JK Simmons in Whiplash, Charlize Theron in Monster – all winners. Villains are critical darlings every inch as much as they are fan favourites. Most actors say it is much more fun playing the knave than the hero, so it’s easy to see why Lena Headey created one of TV’s great monsters in Game of Thrones’ Cersei Lannister, but also stole 2012’s Dredd as the joyously psychopathic drug kingpin Ma-Ma Madrigal. Anything in which Jason Isaacs plays a right bastard – Potter, The OA, The Patriot – is essential viewing. Gary Oldman, Helena Bonham Carter, Ruth Wilson: if they are playing a baddie in something, people will watch it for no other reason. There’s such an embarrassment of larks and accolades in being bad it’s a wonder anyone strives to be good. An actor doesn’t have to be born with a permanent sneer and an arched brow, either. Robin Williams made a chilling nasty in Insomnia and One Hour Photo. Denzel Washington is spellbinding as the unhinged bent copper in Training Day. America’s sweetheart Meryl Streep was a next-level sod in The Devil Wears Prada. David Tennant’s ascent to full-blown national treasure has been assured by a post-Doctor volte face in which he has played every manner of swine, from Dennis Nilsen to Jessica Jones’s gaslighter general Kilgrave. And the sooner Tom Cruise abandons his midlife crisis, accepts he’s creepy AF and gets back to the Magnolias, Interview With the Vampires and Collaterals to which he’s far more suited, the better. Heroes are fine, but they come and go, more or less interchangeably: Arnie begat Bruce who begat Will Smith who begat Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Those few actors lucky enough to play ne’er-do-wells know this: that it is great villains who linger, who sink their claws into us, needle away at our subconscious, delighting and disgusting us decade after decade. Perhaps they don’t want to change. They’re not trapped at all by their God-given bastardry. They’re freed by it. Only by being bad can they get to be this good, and they love it. And who can blame them? Bwa-ha-ha-ha-haaaaaa."
"Ottobah Cugoano, an 18th-century anti-slavery campaigner who wrote the most radical abolitionist text of its time, has become the earliest black figure to receive a blue plaque. The plaque on a building in Pall Mall, central London, aims to shine light on the remarkable and little-known story of a man described by the historian David Olusoga as a “true pioneer … the first African to demand the total abolition of slavery and one of the leaders of Georgian London’s black community.” It follows cold case reviews of black and minority ethnic figures from history by an English Heritage working group tasked with getting more diverse representation in the scheme. Cugoano was born near the coast of present-day Ghana where he was kidnapped in 1770 by slave traders. He was only 13, later writing: “I was early snatched away from my native country, with about 18 or 20 more boys and girls, as we were playing in a field … Some of us attempted, in vain, to run away, but pistols and cutlasses were soon introduced, threatening, that if we offered to stir, we should all lie dead on the spot.” He was forced on to a ship heading for the West Indies where he was sold to plantation owners in Grenada. After two years he became a servant to a prominent slave-owner and was taken to England where he was baptised, now 16, as John Stuart. At some point he gained his freedom and by the mid-1780s he was employed as a servant to the fashionable painters Richard and Maria Cosway, working at their grand residence, Schomberg House, where the plaque celebrating Cugoano has now been placed. A self-portrait etching by Cosway depicts him and his wife seated in their garden being fed grapes by Cugoano, dressed in crimson silk in imitation of footmen at the Vatican. It was while living at Schomberg House that Cugoano wrote the book Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Humbly Submitted to the Inhabitants of Great Britain. It was one of the first black authored anti-slavery books to be published in Britain and is regarded as the most radical in its arguments. Cugoano took on the reasoning used by apologists for slavery, that Africans were complicit in the trade, by inviting readers to imagine slave raids on Britain by African pirates “assisted by some of your own insidious neighbours, for there may be some men even among you vile enough to do such a thing if they could get money by it.” He advanced the view that “the difference of colour and complexion, which it hath pleased God to appoint among men, are no more unbecoming than the different shades of the rainbow are unseemly to the whole … It does not alter the nature or quality of a man, whether he wears a black or white coat – whether he puts it on or strips it off, he is still the same man.” Schomberg House was mentioned on the frontispiece as one of the places the book could be obtained, suggesting that the Cosways supported Cugoano. Olusoga, a member of English Heritage’s blue plaques panel, said: “Ottobah Cugoano was a remarkable man, one who himself had known the horrors of slavery. Having survived he used words and arguments to fight against the slave trade and slavery. “I am delighted that English Heritage is celebrating his life with a blue plaque.” Cugoano becomes the earliest black figure with a London blue plaque, joining a group of people that English Heritage acknowledges is too small. Only 4% of the 950 blue plaques across London are dedicated to black and Asian figures from history, a figure Olusoga has called “unacceptably low”. English Heritage said it could be partly explained by the relatively low number of public nominations fulfilling the blue plaque criteria and “by the all too frequent lack of historic records to establish a definitive link between the person in question and the building in which they lived.”"
"What did you spend lockdown doing? If it was anything like my lockdown, it involved live-streaming DJs, bands and theatre and live, intimate performances by solo musicians from their bedrooms. I’ve caught up on a lot of books I might otherwise have claimed I was too busy to read. So it’s thanks to art and artists that I’ve found more reason for hope and excitement the past few months than I have found reasons for grief. The very nature of artists is to investigate, question and express something essential of the mood of the world – or just their world. And through this period, musicians, artists, dancers, choreographers, writers, games developers and everyone with a creative outlet has continuing to work, to create, to innovate and to share their creative talents under immense financial and emotional pressure. Take singer-songwriter and violinist Xani Kolac, who lost months of work on a stage production when shutdown kicked off in Australia in March. Since then she’s has been performing on Twitch TV and Instagram Live, her sequinned costumes and the unpredictable, joyful nature of her social media streams a glistening bubble of hope on days when I felt like I was existing in a vacuum. Will she be dancing wildly today, or riffing on the loops her fans have sent in for an improv jazz session? Playing violin or singing? She’s been a pandemic panacea for me. In lockdown, I walked a lot. From Collingwood, my dog and I walked through Fitzroy Gardens to the city. Normally, I’d never try to manoeuvre a small, excitable, furry creature through streets that would ordinarily still resemble John Brack’s famous painting, Collins St, 5p.m. But in the quiet, we walked to the NGV and admired its formidable water wall and empty forecourt. We walked through Federation Square and past the Australian Centre for Moving Image, Birrarung Marr, the Arts Centre and the Forum theatre, too. All these beautiful Melbourne places of performance, noise, talent, unity and the sacred act of making and sharing our stories … empty. Later, I watched a performance by the Australian Ballet, who screened some of their most beloved classical works online for free, including my favourite, Giselle. Giselle is the story of a peasant maid who falls in love with a philandering count. She goes mad at the end of the first act, appearing to her lover as a wili – a ghostly apparition – during the second. The ghostly Giselle dances with her lover throughout the night, still in love with him despite his betrayal, before vanishing at dawn. Watching the ballet under lockdown, I felt an unexpected sympathy with Giselle – not for the love of another person but for the city, and that sense of being banished to some ghostly, half-realm. Giselle, in its bittersweet romantic loveliness, at that moment echoed for me the melancholic air of longing for the outdoors, the bustle, the noise, the safety of the life we knew only yesterday. I had enjoyed visiting theatres, galleries, cinemas and music performances up until the doors closed in March, but not as much as I could have. I suspect I’m far from alone in taking Melbourne’s arts venues and artists for granted. I imagined, like Giselle’s ghostly apparition dancing tirelessly in the dark, silent hours, that those buildings in the centre of Melbourne were not really silent, the energy of storytellers past and future keeping them abuzz beyond our human senses. So even in the darkest of times during lockdown, I found hope. Even as their incomes dwindled and freedoms were curtailed, so many artists have sought unlikely collaborations or outlets for their work. They have been vulnerable and candid and provided their audiences with the licence to admit to their own mental health battles. What they have not done is ceased to create, to share their work and themselves. Let’s not forget how much our mental and spiritual health was buoyed by books, music, design, podcasts, dance and online theatre during lockdown, and channel our gratitude into ticket sales and funding support to keep the arts dancing infinitely."
"My friend Steve Sykes, who has died aged 70 after a stroke, was the dynamic and inspiring chair of the annual Holmfirth arts festival in West Yorkshire. He steered the organisation with imagination and pragmatism, developing the artistic and, crucially, the financial side of the festival. His eclectic and adventurous creative spirit made him a valued leader who inspired a large group of volunteers. A talented guitarist and pianist – latterly adding tenor sax and banjo to his repertoire – he played in numerous local bands for 55 years, often for ceilidhs and community dance projects. Steve was equally at home playing a rock classic or a French chanson or helping to run a therapeutic music session in a care home. For the past 24 years he had been a central member of FEB, a group that plays rock, jazz, folk and music for theatre. He also worked extensively with Xylosound, a band for adults with additional needs. Making music was central to his life; his guitar was never far away. During lockdown he organised a socially distanced FEB recording in his garden for a CD to raise money for Dementia UK. Very much a facilitator, and an advocate for overseas development, he once arranged to send one of his guitars to a teacher also called Stephen he had met while travelling in Zimbabwe, who could not afford his own. They shared a name, the same birthday and, eventually, a guitar. Born in Honley, West Yorkshire, to Leonard, the manager of Rock Mills Textiles in Brockholes, and Hilda (nee Bates), a housewife, Steve attended Holme Valley grammar school, where he met Lesley Hollingworth, whom he married in 1972. When he left school, he went to worked at ICI in Huddersfield before choosing to study colour chemistry at Bradford University. After graduation, he drove cranes at a graphite factory in Sheffield and worked on the construction of the M62, although – as he often said – he had some help with this task. The budgie-breeding aviary he built at the age of 11 was the first of a lifetime of “projects”; later he kept chickens, grew vegetables, and combined his understanding of the natural world with a passion for construction. He taught the sciences, first at Brooke school in Sheffield, later at Mirfield free grammar as senior teacher/acting deputy and, finally, at Shelley college, where he relished returning to a teaching role. His retirement in 2010 gave him the opportunity to create more huts, shelters, greenhouses and spaces for convivial gatherings at his home, as well as enabling his huge involvement in the arts festival. Steve was a generous friend. The arts festival will be dedicating an annual commission in his memory. He is survived by Lesley, their children, Joe and Ellen, their grandchildren, Ren and Maya, and his brother, Keith."
"Griffith University’s art school, the Queensland College of Art (QCA), has announced it will scrap its bachelor of photography – part of broader cuts at the university which will see 144 positions axed across all faculties. The school that counts Venice Biennale artist Tracey Moffatt among its alumni announced the decision late on Wednesday, along with confirmation that the bachelor of creative and interactive media would go as well. The news comes just three weeks after the Australian Centre for Photography in Sydney announced it was closing its doors after 46 years of operation. It follows a string of tertiary institutions taking the razor to their fine arts and performing arts faculties, including the ANU’s School of Art and Design, the University of Newcastle’s major in theatre and Monash University’s Centre for Theatre and Performance. The cuts at QCA mean the loss of 10 full-time positions – about 30% of its staff, not all academic – as part of a broader restructure by Griffith University. It follows a $700m predicted shortfall in revenue over the next five years, due to the loss of international students. . The two degrees cut from QCA are among a dozen removed from Griffith University faculties under the restructure. The university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Carolyn Evans, described Wednesday’s decision – which followed a four-week consultation period – as “one of the most challenging days in [Griffith University’s] history”. “I am very conscious that every person who is impacted will have families, mortgages and other commitments, and this will be a very distressing time for them,” she said in a statement. The QCA Students, Alumni & Community Support Group had attracted almost 12,000 signatories to its Save Our Staff and Studios petition. Group spokesperson Kathleen O’Hagan, a third-year fine art student, told the Guardian that while students and staff were relieved that a handful of jobs slated to go had now been saved – including at the school’s printmaking, jewellery and small objects studios – the eradication of the photography and creative media degrees would have far-reaching consequences. “At the QCA we’re really interdisciplinary, so if you cut a leg off, and take away the teachers and the software that teach practical handmade skills, it’s the whole community that bleeds,” she said. The National Tertiary Education Union told Guardian Australian the University’s cuts were unnecessary and short-sighted. “There are other places the university could have gone to make up the predicted shortfall [in revenue], which is a short-term pain,” said Michael McNally, the union’s Queensland division secretary. “They could have further deferred their massive capital works program. “To make job cuts at this time of the year, when some faculties are reporting higher enrolments [in 2021] than this time last year, shows a lack of caring.” The decision follows the Australian National University’s School of Art & Design proposed funding cuts, announced in November, that will terminate courses in furniture-making, jewellery and objects to counteract the school’s $3.5m deficit. In the performing arts, the University of Newcastle’s major in theatre has been suspended for 2021, while Monash University in Melbourne has scrapped its theatre program completely. In July, the University of NSW announced the merger of its art and design faculty into the built environment and arts and social sciences faculties. The universities have invariably attributed the cuts to the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting loss of international students, which contributed $10bn in fees to Australian tertiary institutions in 2019. The National Association for the Visual Arts’ acting CEO, Penelope Benton, said she believed universities’ fine arts faculties were taking a disproportionate hit in the Covid-19 crunch. “The deficits that universities are showing aren’t that different [from other sectors] ... and they really do not need to make such drastic cuts,” she told the Guardian. “It is looking like many of the universities are looking very simply at their spreadsheets and saying, ‘OK, studios take up that much space and what, you’ve only got 30 students doing that? It doesn’t make any sense real estate-wise when we’ve got these other lecture theatres that can fit 200 students in’.” Benton said the wider messaging from the federal government over universities’ role in turning out job-ready graduates had not helped. In June, the education minister, Dan Tehan, announced that the future student contribution for a three-year humanities degree would more than double – from $20,400 to $43,500. “I think universities have a legitimate fear that there could be less people applying for and enrolling in humanities degrees in the future, just because of the cost,” she said. “That’s a huge part of it, but not all of it. Throughout this year, we’ve heard language from the federal government that the arts are non-essential and this has had a tremendous impact. “To hear that kind of language is quite demoralising. Universities are picking up on that ‘non-essential arts’ message and making budget decisions with this in mind. “The impact has been huge.”"
"Since Covid-19 restrictions began to ease around Australia, musicians and live music aficionados have noticed apparent discrepancies in permitted events.  Sporting matches have jampacked mega-stadiums while live music gigs have languished in 25% or less audience capacity under restrictive physical distancing rules. “I was thinking we could start classifying events like this as football matches,” pop artist Jack River told the physically distanced crowd at the Great Southern Nights concert at Sydney’s Qudos Bank arena on 28 November. “Gladys, sort it out.” River was referring to the fact that back in August, the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, gave the go ahead for the NRL grand final at the ANZ Stadium to achieve 50% capacity in the outdoor venue capable of seating more than 80,000 people. The Great Southern Nights gig on the other hand was restricted to 25% capacity – later lifted to just under 30% through an exemption by the NSW government. River hasn’t been the only artist to raise questions. “Did the music community get lost in the numbers game?” the industry magazine Industry Observer asked after 30,000 people flooded the Gabba in Queensland for the AFL grand final in October, followed by 50,000 football fans pouring into Suncorp Stadium for the State of Origin decider in November. Singer-songwriter Amy Shark, rock band Powderfinger and the Church guitarist Ian Haug also see a double-standard. “Is there a magical reason that differentiates how Covid is spread between rugby fans and music fans?” asked electronic duo Peking Duk. Are their concerns justified? Or is it a bit more complicated? The issue is, on the face of it, a simple numbers game about how many people you can pack into a confined space without risking a further wave of of the virus, regardless of whether that crowd is cheering on a football team or a rock band. But only to a point. Take NSW, where the rules depend largely on whether a venue is classified as an indoor or outdoor stadium. NSW’s indoor-outdoor rules explain why the NRL grand final at the ANZ stadium – which is classified as outdoor – was allowed to reach 50% capacity under the previous restrictions, while the Great Southern Nights concert at the Qudos Bank arena – considered indoor – was capped at 25%. As of December, NSW outdoor entertainment venues, be they for sporting or cultural pursuits, can have 100% capacity for fixed seating, and indoor major recreation facilities can sell tickets for only 75% seating capacity. If a music promoter was confident it could sell 83,500 tickets to the outdoor ANZ Stadium, there would be nothing preventing the concert from going ahead at full capacity. And this is what the Australian promoter of next year’s Guns N’Roses tour, TEG Dainty, has done, placing 83,500 ticket on sale for its 14 November concert at the venue. But the 75% rule applies to Qudos Bank Arena, which has capacity for only 21,000 people. The Sydney Kings versus Illawarra Hawks basketball game there on 20 December will have fewer than 16,000 attending. It is outside the outdoor major recreation facilities framework where the NSW rules start to appear erratic. “Most live music events happen outside a stadium context – from large parks to vineyards,” Live Performance Australia’s chief executive Evelyn Richardson said.  “It’s just not cost-effective for most [live music acts] to book the large stadiums, but the rules continue to be far more restrictive for alternative outdoor venues … There doesn’t seem to be much logic behind it.” At the time of writing, an outdoor event outside a stadium setting is capped at 5,000 people in NSW. This means the traditional Carols in the Domain has had to be reimagined as a largely televised event, yet three weeks later up to 80,000 soccer fans will be allowed to flood into ANZ Stadium for the Sydney FC v Wanderers FC match. In Victoria, both indoor and outdoor seated entertainment venues can now open for up to 75% of capacity, but with no more than 1,000 people. Yet Victorian health authorities recently granted a special exemption for up to 30,000 people to attend the Boxing Day Test (India v Australia) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Any outdoor live music event in Victoria over the summer wanting to sell more than 1,000 tickets will have to seek an exemption requiring approval from the chief health officer and the ministerial taskforce, including three government state ministers: health, police and major events. In South Australia, more than 25,000 spectators are expected to be allowed into the first India v Australia Test at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday. Yet the Botanic Park has been deemed too risky to allow the Womadelaide four-day music festival to go ahead as usual in March. It has been reduced to a single stage with individually reserved seats in King Rodney Park, with a cap of just 6,000 people per concert. Then there is the issue of singing. “We’ve all been told that singing is a Covid-19 health risk, but they’re still singing the national anthem before most large sporting events,” Richardson said. Live music followers have said the differences between gigs and sporting matches make them feel hard done by. “As we move forwards into 2021 and governments further lift restrictions across the country, we would like to see alignment between sport and cultural settings,” Richardson said. “All events require Covid-safe plans and our industry has developed robust guidelines to support our reactivation. “Ironing out these anomalies will greatly assist the industry in getting our shows back on stage and our people back to work.”"
"My first thought was Margaret Cho. I used to watch her DVDs at 18 while stoned, and just marvel at her talking about sex and gay rights.

"With the money yet to start flowing from the federal government’s $250m Covid-19 rescue package for the arts, sectors of the Australian industry continue to raise concerns over the transparency of the process amid fears that smaller states and organisations may miss out. $75m of the package will be allocated directly from the arts minister’s office under the Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (Rise) fund. In contrast, the Australia Council for the Arts – the statutory body founded on the principles of peer assessment and arm’s-length funding – will receive just $35m, with the government earmarking those funds away from smaller organisations and to be awarded to “significant commonwealth-funded arts and culture organisations”. To date the minister, Paul Fletcher, had received “about 280 eligible applications” to the Rise fund, a spokesman said in a statement on Wednesday. Senate estimates heard on 21 October that the department expected to get the money flowing by November, but that deadline has now changed to “before the end of the year”. On 13 November, the first hearing for a federal government inquiry into Australia’s creative and cultural industries and institutions will take place in Canberra. Two recurrent themes among the 252 submissions lodged with the inquiry so far are the need to separate politics from funding decisions, and concerns that small- to medium-tier organisations will be overlooked. An arts and cultural management academic from the University of Melbourne, Associate Prof Dr Jo Caust, told Guardian Australia those fears might not be unfounded. “When there’s political involvement in grants decision-making, it can end up being a rort of some sort,” she said, referring to the so-called “sports rorts” controversy earlier this year, and an ABC investigation in May alleging that $44 million in New South Wales arts funding had been funnelled into Coalition electorates in the lead-up to the 2018 state election. “It’s really important that there is some distance between the [grant] decision-making and the political structure,” Caust said. Another concern, she said, was that conservative government funding decisions tended to favour large, flagship companies and high art. “When there is an ambivalence towards the arts sector, as we are experiencing now under the current federal government, the smaller organisations will suffer the most as they are less visible to the politicians.” Fletcher’s spokesman said there was nothing unusual about the Rise allocation decisions coming directly out of the minister’s office, and that the electorate of an application “does not have any bearing” on the score it receives in the process. “In addition to balancing funding across organisation size, we are also committed to ensuring representation across other measures, such as different art forms, diverse groups and geographic locations,” he said. “When we announce the successful applicants, we will provide information on this spread to look to alleviate any concerns.” With more than two-thirds of Australia’s 30 major performing arts companies based in NSW, Victoria or Queensland, there have been concerns raised that smaller states may not receive equitable treatment. In its submission to the inquiry, the Arts Industry Council of South Australia said it was concerned that “the small to medium sector in South Australia will not receive the full benefit of the [$250m] creative economy support package, especially as the fund is not being administered via the Australia Council”. Speaking to the Guardian, the council’s executive director, Julianne Pierce, said: “Our concern in South Australia [which has no national arts organisations] is that the small to medium sector is the bedrock here. “Obviously the [federal rescue package] is welcome, but we believe the money must flow down to artists and art workers, rather than just propping up large organisations.” Country Arts SA urged the inquiry to “maintain clear distinctions between the role and purpose of the Office for the Arts [Fletcher’s office] and the Australia Council”. Shelagh Magadza, the executive director of the Chamber for Arts and Culture in Western Australia, said funding at the federal level tended to take a “one size fits all” approach that disadvantaged less-populated states, where small to medium arts organisations required more nuanced and locally focused support. The potential for political interference in the grant deciding process was a perennial issue, she said. “I think this reflects years of discussion … It possibly came to a head in 2016, with the [George] Brandis situation, and things have never really settled since then.”  The “Brandis situation” occurred in 2015, when the then-arts minister redirected $104.8m away from the Australia Council to create an “arts excellence” fund directly dispersed from the minister’s office. Labor and arts organisations across Australia campaigned heavily against the removal of the “arm’s length” principle of arts funding under the Brandis scheme. His successor, Mitch Fifield, reversed the scheme and returned most of the funding back to the Australia Council the following year. Caust said the $75m Rise funding appeared to be a return to the Brandis model. “The minister [is having] the final decision, and that’s really problematic.” When announcing the federal government arts rescue package, Fletcher said “experienced assessors will assess each application on its merit and compare it to other eligible applications”. The assessors would be “officials from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications”, he said. A creative economy taskforce was appointed to advise the assessors but it has no say on where the money goes, its chair, Elizabeth Ann Macgregor, said in October."

"It is best known for its collection of some of the most iconic cars of the past 100 years, so the Lakeland Motor Museum’s latest addition to its repertoire is likely to raise some eyebrows. A Vauxhall Corsa, one of the UK’s most commonly used cars of the past three decades, will soon be displayed alongside a collection of rare vehicles. Museum curators predict the 1994 GLS model could become one of their rarest exhibits, given its rapid decline in popularity. “We’re playing a long game with this car,” said the duty manager, Chris Williams. “At the moment you’d think you’d be far more likely to see one of these in a supermarket car park than a museum, but numbers are dwindling very fast and this model is around five years away from becoming extinct.”  For every new exhibit, an old one has to be removed. As a result, one of the Backbarrow museum’s longer-term residents, a 1973 Austin Allegro, has moved on to the Haynes International Motor Museum in Somerset, after being on display since 2010. Practical Classics magazine has praised the bold move, writing: “We say well done Lakeland Motor Museum for pulling off a classic world first!” Williams said that based on current projections by the motoring industry, there would be hardly any of this particular model of Corsa left by 2025. “With that in mind, we are getting one now while they are still relatively easy to find. I actually feel a bit nostalgic about this car as I had a 2000 version myself – same style, same engine. We are all about unlocking memories, and in a few years we think this particular car will certainly achieve that goal. Remember: every new car gets old,” he said. As the Cumbrian attraction prepares to reopen its doors in December, the team has been hard at work to ensure new vehicles are brought in for Christmas and the new year. “It’s certainly been a busy few weeks here at the museum, with quite a few new cars being prepared for display. There are plenty more to come and we are looking forward to revealing more details over the next few weeks,” Williams said."
"It has been a long time coming but a decision on whether east London will get a slice of Las Vegas in the form of a state-of-the art entertainment venue almost as tall as St Paul’s may be nigh. The Madison Square Garden Sphere in Stratford would, its owners claim, create 4,300 construction jobs and a further 3,200 when it opens. Capable of hosting concerts for 21,500 people, the Sphere will feature the largest, highest resolution screen in the world, according to MSG, which owns many US entertainment venues. But the project, the brainchild of MSG’s chief executive, James Dolan, a major donor to Donald Trump, is proving divisive. When it was unveiled in 2018, the Sphere received support from the then culture secretary, Matt Hancock, and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. But since then local councillors, many residents and a rival entertainment giant have come out against it. A decision on whether to approve the Sphere was supposed to have been reached by the end of this year after the initial application was made in March 2019, but the public consultation had to be extended for a third time – until 4 December – amid concerns about its impact on the area. Lyn Garner, the chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation, whose planning committee holds the fate of the scheme in its hands, recently suggested a determination will be reached in January. A rejection would be a major setback for MSG. The firm hopes to roll out the concept in other countries but so far has only one Sphere under construction, in Las Vegas. MSG says an independent survey it commissioned found 85% of people supported the plan. But Lindesay Mace, of Stop MSG Sphere, a group of Newham residents who fear the Sphere will “blight the area”, described the polling as a sham. “Something like 80% of people surveyed hadn’t even heard about the proposal,” she said. We would ask: “Did the pollsters tell them about it or show them images before they asked whether they supported it? Did they discuss any negative aspects about the Sphere?” A central concern is light. The Sphere will have a “digital skin” stretched over a 2-hectare facade featuring nearly 1m external LEDs. MSG stresses it will be dimmed after 11pm to barely above that of twilight, but this does not reassure opponents. “To put a 90 metre by 120 metre glowing blob among people’s flats is just completely crazy,” Mace said. “It’s the wrong development for the wrong area.” But residents opposed to the scheme believe the odds are against them, pointing out that of 12 members on the corporation’s planning committee only five are elected local councillors. Some have also questioned whether London needs another giant venue. AEG, the operator of the nearby O2 arena, warns that the scheme would place huge pressure on local infrastructure. MSG points out that London has only two large capacity indoor arenas capable of hosting major acts – the 02 and the SSE Arena Wembley – while New York has seven, and Berlin, Paris and Madrid all have more large venues per person than London. And it claims that the Sphere will be more than a music arena, a unique venue that can host immersive, interactive experiences such as eGaming competitions. “MSG Sphere will be a state-of-the-art entertainment venue that supports thousands of good jobs and generates billions of pounds of economic benefit,” a spokesman said. “Our planning application reflects the constructive dialogue we have had with a range of stakeholders and demonstrates the thoughtful consideration that has gone into every aspect of our proposal.” So far, almost 2,000 documents relating to the planning application have been submitted to the development corporation. Despite this, Mace said MSG had yet to address many concerns relating to noise, travel, air and light pollution. “MSG have made a lot of noise about the consultation that they have carried out with local residents, but it does feel like a David and Goliath battle.’’"
"As Marc Burrows’ article (Million-pound question: why save Secret Cinema while real cinemas are in ruins?, 14 October) acknowledges, “there may be some comparison of apples with oranges here”. To strain the metaphor, the government’s culture recovery fund is a rich orchard of different fruit. The article focuses on one grant to one organisation, Secret Cinema, that is part of a bigger funding picture, including support from the BFI for independent cinema. In doing so, it ignores the breadth of the fund’s positive impact on people’s lives across England. The portion of the fund that the Arts Council administers is demand-led, with the aim of preventing vulnerable but valued cultural organisations from becoming insolvent. To qualify for funding, organisations need to be at risk of financial failure. Awards of all sizes have been made, proportionate to the needs of the organisations. They also have to show that they are culturally significant. This criterion centres on the value of the work they do in their communities and on the national stage. In the first two rounds of the funding alone, nearly 2,000 grants have been awarded to a vast range of brilliant organisations. Our creative organisations generate economic returns, provide freelance opportunities, undertake valuable community work and make art that will be remembered for generations.

"Ancient mammoth tusk is a seriously niche material to work in, but there is one place where the skills and carving techniques involved are still passed down the generations. A major new British Museum exhibition, Arctic: Culture and Climate, which starts this week in London, will feature an extraordinary piece of “very rare” sculpture, one that details an arcane ritual and has been completed in collaboration with the Sakha people of north-eastern Russia. The exhibition, which opens on Thursday, has brought together the largest and most wide-ranging collection of objects from some of the northern-most regions of the world to be displayed in Britain. It focuses not just on details of ancient traditions but on the impact of political and climate change. Alongside other archeological finds and historic artefacts, such as an antique sled from Greenland and a bronze Evenki spirit mask, the public will have the first chance to see a newly-complete mammoth tusk model, originally made almost 200 years ago and depicting an ancient annual summer festival known as “yhyakh”. “The people of this Sakha community had a very strong revival after the Soviet era ended,” said British Museum curator Amber Lincoln. “Their belief system persists as a faith, although some are also Christian now. Nowadays the yhyakh serves as much as a ritual about national or ethnic identity as for its original purpose of celebrating the summer and praying for good weather.” Museum experts now have a clearer picture of the ceremony because of the help of art students from the Sakha region who spotted that the model had missing components. It had been lent to Russia for an exhibition, and while on show two students worked to make new figures to finish the scene. On the model’s return, ahead of the new London show, curators commissioned a Sakha artist and master carver, Fedor Markov, to work on fresh replacements for the display. “Carving the tusk is a high and specialist artform. As a material, it has a different quality to the walrus tusks the Inuit peoples use,” said Lincoln, who also had to request from the Sakha authorities a particularly high quality tusk for Markov to work on. “We really benefited from what the students had noticed in Russia. Aside from the fact it is a very rare object, it is fantastic to have it in the gallery this month because it is almost like a teaching tool, showing visitors how the real ritual items in the gallery were originally used.” The semi-nomadic community of Sakha, who call themselves “people of the sun”, and are also known as Yakuts, are a Turkic ethnic group who still celebrate two key religious festivals each year, both revolving around fermented mare’s milk, or koumiss. “The ceremony’s name can be translated as “sprinkling”, because that’s what the shaman does with the mare’s milk,” explained Lincoln. “It is a way of calling for good weather that will lead to a good harvest. The 24-hour sun at that time of year in the arctic means that if the weather is good there can be an abundance of hay that would take them all the way through the winter. So it was a key moment in their year.” The model shows the central figures of the summer solstice ceremony, with a conical tent and the ceremonial jug and drinking vessels, all corralled inside a fenced area that has been delicately hewn from wood and from preserved mammoth tusk. Still precious and uncommon, the tusks are actually found with increasing frequency due to the impact of global heating on the polar ice cap. “The permafrost is melting more, and more and so these mammoth tasks are being found a bit more often. It’s an amazing example of how museums and indigenous communities can work together to create something that explains a new bit of history and gives us new knowledge to share,” said Lincoln."
"Autumnal days are drawing in and Covid-19 restrictions are tightening. But it is not all doom and gloom. The world of culture is fighting back, aiming to boost the spirit of a nation. Here are just a few highlights to look forward to. Autumn and the lead up to Christmas are a busy time for publishers, even busier this year because of postponements. For escapism away from pandemic reality, there is a huge choice. Fiction includes the last two unpublished novels from the Booker longlist: Gabriel Krauze’s Who They Was (4th Estate), which is set amid London’s gang culture; and the US author Diane Cook’s The New Wilderness (Oneworld), in which a mother and daughter embark on a dangerous experiment in living. Meanwhile, Don DeLillo’s The Silence, which was completed just weeks before coronavirus hit, is set in the near future about five people gathered together in a Manhattan apartment during a different kind of catastrophic event. For those from whom lockdown offered an opportunity to hone culinary skills, there is inspiration in the form of Ottolenghi Flavour (Ebury Press), by Yotam Ottolenghi, Nadiya Bakes (Michael Joseph), by Nadiya Hussain, and Cook, Eat, Repeat, by Nigella Lawson (Chatto). And not forgetting the celebrity memoirs, with Ant and Dec’s Once Upon a Tyne: Our Story Celebrating 30 Years Together on Telly (Sphere) on some people’s Christmas list. With planned releases of the next James Bond thriller, No Time to Die, and Steven Spielberg’s remake of West Side Story both pushed back, times are uncertain in the cinema world. Mank is David Fincher’s first movie as director since Gone Girl in 2014, with Netflix announcing it is headed to cinemas in November and will be available on its streaming platform from 4 December. The black-and-white biopic follows the life of the screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz and his battle with Orson Welles over the screenplay credit of Citizen Kane. It stars Gary Oldman as Mankiewicz. Also due for release in coming weeks is Death on the Nile, with Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot and Wonder Woman 1984, starring Gal Gadot and set in the middle of the cold war. Dark nights before the small screen beckon, and despite the pandemic shaking up the TV industry, there is something for everyone to look forward to. The return of The Crown (season 4), on Netflix from 15 November, is the last to feature Olivia Colman as Queen before she hands the baton over to Imelda Staunton, and focuses on the 1980s, with Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher. Small Axe, on BBC One from 15 November, is from the Oscar-winning writer and director Steve McQueen, and stars the Star Wars actor John Boyega as well as Line of Duty’s Rochenda Sandall. Set within the West Indian community, the five episodes begin with Enoch Powell’s notorious “Rivers of Blood” speech of 1968. Sky’s The Undoing, which broadcasts from 26 October, casts Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant in a tense drama about a woman whose husband goes missing. ITV’s offers include The Sister, broadcast date to be confirmed, a murder mystery from the Luther creator Neil Cross that stars Russell Tovey. Of course, Christmas Day would not be complete, it seems, without the Call the Midwife festive special on BBC One. Andy Warhol at Tate Modern has been one of the must-see exhibitions of 2020. It has been extended until 15 November and features Warhol’s famed images of Marilyn Monroe and Campbell’s Soup Cans, as well as some largely unseen paintings from the 1970s. The Royal Academy’s annual summer exhibition, which for the first time since 1769 is staged in winter, runs until 3 January. Wrap up well to enjoy the last few days of Anish Kapoor at Houghton Hall in Norfolk. The exhibition of 21 sculptures, many in the gardens, and a selection of drawings spanning 40 years closes on 1 November. Titian: Love, Desire, Death at the National Gallery in London, reunites the six paintings from a series inspired by Ovid’s Metamorphoses for the first time in more than four centuries and runs until 17 January. Also at the National Gallery, the recently opened Artemisia exhibition continues until 24 January. In 17th-century Italy, Artemisia Gentileschi became one of the most celebrated female painters of her time. Slowly but surely theatres are attempting to reopen. The National Theatre celebrates the return of live performance, Covid measures in place, with Death of England: Delroy. Penned by Clint Dyer and Roy Williams, it runs until 28 November and explores a black working-class man searching for truth and confronting his relationship with Great Britain. The West End operator Nimax Theatres has socially distanced performances of several plays, including Six, a musical with a different take on Henry VIII’s wives, and The Play That Goes Wrong. The Nottingham Playhouse, New Vic theatre in Staffordshire, King’s theatre in Portsmouth and many more regional venues are opening their doors. Panto season will also soon be here in some shape or form. Oh yes it will. It’s not Christmas without The Nutcracker set to Tchaikovsky’s glorious score, and the Royal Albert Hall ensures 2020 is no exception. Socially distanced performances from Birmingham’s Royal Ballet will bring Clara’s toys to life and transport you through a fantastical winter wonderland to the kingdom of the Sugar Plum fairy. Sadler’s Well promises a special programme of live dance and digital content, including performances for socially distanced audiences – with seating for separate households only. Live events include English National Ballet performing a specially commissioned programme of five world premieres from Arielle Smith, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, Russell Maliphant, Yuri Possokhov and Stina Quagebeur. In addition there is the rescheduled world premiere performances of Alexander Whitley Company’s Overflow, a mini festival of new work from Breakin’ Convention, and the return of Arthur Pita’s family favourite The Little Match Girl for two weeks at Christmas."
"Born in Portland, Maine, Elizabeth Strout, 64, is the author of six novels including Olive Kitteridge (2008), which won the Pulitzer prize for fiction and has sold more than 1m copies. She published her first short story in 1982 but didn’t find wider success until her debut novel, Amy and Isabelle, came out 16 years later. Her latest novel, Olive, Again, a follow-up to her 2008 bestseller, has just been released in paperback. Strout and her husband, James, a former attorney general, divide their time between homes in Manhattan and Maine. Hélène Grimaud Recently I was listening to a Mozart Pandora [a US music streaming service] station and all of a sudden I sat up and thought: Who is playing that piano piece? It turned out the pianist was Hélène Grimaud. How could it be that I had never heard of her? She is astonishing, magical. She has a touch that feels like no other I’ve heard; firm, electric. This has been an amazing discovery for me. Rumford, Maine During this pandemic, my husband and I grew restless and so we drove to the town of Rumford, Maine, two hours away. Rumford historically was a mill town. The mill owner had come in 1905 and built a series of beautiful houses on the hills of the town for the mill workers to live in. Over time, the mill lost business, and is now producing only a fraction of what it once did. The population has fallen 50%. We found a ghost town; the beautiful houses remained, but were in shambles, with many people out in front of them on an autumn weekday, debris lying everywhere. There were Trump signs on the lawns. Such is the cultural and class divide in this country right now. Edward Hopper One thing I have noticed during this pandemic is how much the work of Edward Hopper continues to comfort me. I have many books, large ones, of his works, and I will thumb through them. It reminds me of a time a number of years ago when the Whitney had a show of Hopper. I had done an event with the poet Anne Carson there, and so the museum director allowed me in to the exhibit that night all by myself. What a thrill! To be able to see Hopper’s works without peering behind anyone. But I got too excited, and I almost could not absorb what I was seeing. Such was the state of my exhilaration. Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St Vincent Millay by Nancy Milford This biography of Edna St Vincent Millay is quite a read. As a child, the suffering of Millay is really estimable; her mother was always gone – she was a nurse – and Millay was left to take care of her two younger sisters in a house where the pipes would freeze and burst. The girls then skated across the kitchen floor. Millay’s imagination seemed with her from the beginning. She made up a mother and wrote to her. This was not her real mother, to whom she also wrote. I am impressed that the child knew intuitively what to do to survive. Call My Agent! Call My Agent! is a French-made series that started on French television in 2015, and is now available on Netflix. It’s – to me – immensely enjoyable, watching the different agents fight among themselves to get various stars, who also have a variety of problems. It’s tense and taut and also funny. Cleaning the house I play the piano at least an hour a day, and that is probably the only thing that comes close to being a hobby of mine. But during this pandemic our housecleaner has gone to work in a nursing home, and so I have been cleaning the house. I cleaned houses in my youth for a number of years and I always did a good job, because I was conscientious. But I hated it. So now, I pretend that I am a maid, and as I wash the floors I sing to myself. It’s been interesting. I know to wait until I feel like doing it, and then I wash the bathtub with gusto, singing my heart out."
"Over seven seasons, Last Week Tonight has covered numerous aspects of the byzantine US immigration system, from immigration courts, to border patrols, to the Trump administration’s disastrous “zero tolerance” family separation policy. And on Sunday, host John Oliver turned to a narrow slice of America’s legal immigration network: asylum, or the legal process by which people who flee persecution apply to stay in the United States. Trump has repeatedly denigrated asylum seekers and discredited the process as a scam, although “as you’ve probably guessed”, Oliver said, “the asylum process isn’t a simple recitation of magic words by which all manner of fraudulent claims are let through, nor is it responsible for, as Trump’s official White House website calls it, the ‘biggest loophole to gain entry into our great country’”. Asylum seekers are like Berta, a woman featured in the Netflix documentary Immigration Nation, who fled Honduras after MS-13 gang members threatened to light her on fire and force her 12-year-old granddaughter into marriage. Berta turned herself into US authorities at the border as she claimed asylum, only to be separated from her granddaughter and held indefinitely in a US detention center. “That is ridiculous – if you asked the cops for help and responded by throwing you into detention, you’d be absolutely furious,” said Oliver of Berta’s case. “You’d probably also be black, but let’s try to take this one systemic social crisis at a time.” Berta’s story is not a one-off, Oliver continued, because the Trump administration’s attack on asylum has been “focused, dedicated and deeply resourceful. And I know that those aren’t adjectives you’re used to associating with this administration, but in this one area, they’ve been truly disciplined about being truly evil.” Typically, Oliver explained, asylum seekers turn themselves into authorities at the border for a “credible fear” screening, and are allowed to stay in the US pending a date in immigration courts. Even before Trump, less than half of those requests were granted; claimants often don’t have a lawyer, and the bar for asylum is high, as you have to prove persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion – criteria the Trump administration has applied narrowly. In other words, “the asylum process has never been easy”, said Oliver, “but this administration has made it absolute hell” with new protocols that “don’t have the harrowing ring of family separation” but represent “another cruel, calculated decision that has largely flown under the radar”. The “Remain in Mexico” program, for example, has forced asylum seekers to await judgments from deliberately backlogged immigration courts in makeshift, inadequate and unsafe refugee camps in Mexico. Conditions are often unsanitary and unsafe; as of May, there were at least 1,114 publicly reported cases of murder, rape, torture, kidnapping and other violent assaults on migrants sent back to Mexico unnecessarily by the US. Kidnappings are such a fact of life, Oliver added, that cartels will give some people a codename upon release to indicate, if they were captured again, that they had already paid a ransom. “It’s pretty bleak when drug cartels have a more efficient system for keeping track of asylum seekers than the US government,” Oliver said. Many migrants relegated to Mexico have missed their asylum hearings in the US, a fact the acting homeland security secretary and “human razor burn” Chad Wolf attributed to “walking away” from not having a “meritorious claim”. “These hearings are migrants’ only shot at getting to safety; it’s everything they’ve been waiting for, and if they miss their hearing, they lose their case,” Oliver retorted. “So a person not showing up in court after you forced them to wait in a dangerous area without adequate shelter or support isn’t proof they were trying to cheat the system. It’s proof your system is not fucking working.” The government hasn’t made the hearings easy to attend; immigration attorneys have reported hearings scheduled for outside court hours and notices without date or time. Basically, “the government system is about as effective as painting ‘meet us at the place’ on a raccoon and just throwing it over the wall into Mexico”, Oliver said. “Good luck getting the instructions, and if you do, good luck figuring out how to follow them.” And then there’s Title 42, a provision outside immigration code that gives the federal government broad power to act during a public health crisis. The Trump administration, citing the coronavirus pandemic, has invoked Title 42 to close the border and eject migrants with pending applications in what Oliver called “a transparent attempt to exploit this pandemic to do whatever they want with migrants”. “Invoking Title 42 has basically created a shadow deportation system that moves quickly and is accountable to no one,” Oliver added; since March, there have been 197,371 expulsions of asylum seekers, without a successful court hearing. The system, Oliver concluded, is “shattered”, and potentially solidifying, as the Trump administration aims to make Title 42 permanent, drafted new regulations to reject asylum requests outright and redesigned the application process in English, with impossibly tight deadlines. For those despairing, Oliver concluded, “there is actually one thing you can do: you can vote for Joe Biden”. Although the American immigration system has been “pretty shitty under Democratic administrations too, like the one Joe Biden was in for eight years” and Biden isn’t “the perfect candidate” (Oliver found his stance against Medicare for All “utterly ridiculous” and “aviator glasses should only be worn by hot pilots, cute babies and cute baby pilots”), Biden has promised to end the Remain in Mexico policy and restore asylum eligibility for domestic violence survivors and victims of gang persecution. “The fact is, a lot of our immigration policy is set solely by the executive branch,” Oliver concluded. “We can’t begin to fix the damage done by this administration until we replace the administration itself.”"
"When I was told to write one of these 10 funniest things on the internet columns my first thought was, “Oh no, the internet isn’t for remembering things.” My second thought was, “Oh no, I don’t know what’s funny.” And my third thought was, “They’re really letting anyone do one of these.” Does it count if it’s on the internet but was originally on something else? Because that’s a lot of things. So it’s always good to start with an existential lack of confidence in the fundamental structures of the game. Most of my memories of laughing at the internet come from when I was about 15 – a period when the internet was on a big clumpy desktop in our living room, when I was cackling with my twin brother over things that almost certainly don’t hold up today, and which I can’t bear to go back to in case they don’t. One was a website that had little animations of a dinosaur that was critical of capitalism, which I’ve found impossible to google. There was also a deeply worried existential bat character that I screenshot to use as my avatar on my teenage LiveJournal. Anyway, this list is as much “10 things I can remember from the internet” as anything else. This is just a man reading different questions from people about pregnancy where they’ve misspelled the word “pregnant”. For a list of queries, a high proportion of which were probably written amid deep human emotion, and that might be characterised as punching down, this builds a level of absurdity that I find irresistible. “PREGANANANT” just hits the sweet spot for me. Zach Baron’s GQ interview with Robert Pattinson is beautifully written, and the description about three-quarters of the way through of Pattinson’s attempt to cook his own recipe is gorgeous. It escalates into absurdity and, as Baron acknowledges, he’s not sure if Pattinson is doing a bit, being earnestly incompetent, completely unhinging from reality, or a bit of each. The best way to enjoy this is to read it out loud to a friend. It’s no secret that I love Laura Davis. She’s glorious, and her deeply under-appreciated comedy chops are undeniable. Gobby or Shark is a clip of standup that’s a great example of her combination of brutality and wistfulness. I’d recommend getting onboard with all her work, including her latest album, The Bus Show, which was recorded in a cupboard during lockdown and is one of the most successful versions of comedy-without-an-audience I’ve experienced. Why do I find people finding things funny so funny? One of the things I can’t resist is other people laughing at stuff. It brings me joy and may well be one of the reasons I love doing comedy. The Toast was consistently brilliant and I’m sad it’s shut down, but I regularly go back to the Two Monks series when I’m miserable and it always makes me laugh. It’s hard to choose just one but here you go. Daniel Lavery is one of my favourite internet writers, sliding effortlessly between the beauty of linguistic stylings that can be understood as a sort of stylistic historical fanfiction and an extremely modern internet sensibility. His book, Something That May Shock and Discredit You, is surreal and incisive. A little song about Bible stories. It’s sweet, heartbreaking, gorgeously musical, political, deeply human and very funny, which is a lot to fit into 3:07. In fact, the whole album is beautiful, and my favourite song on it isn’t comedy at all. I saw the show Love you, Hate Bastards in Edinburgh last year and it made me laugh and then cry hysterically, which is maybe not comedy, but is my favourite kind of comedy. I thought it was quite funny in retrospect that it had made me cry so much, so made a friend play the album in the car on a long drive, and was telling her when the sad song came up that it was the one that made me cry, and then I cried hysterically again in her car, to everyone’s great embarrassment. This is a gorgeous short film, beautifully shot by the puppeteer Johannes Nyholm, predicated on the old premise that toddlers are tiny drunks or destructive Vikings. It’s way too much effort for a very simple joke; it’s weirdly melancholy, surprisingly provocative, existentially dumb and it makes me laugh. There are a million videos of my two year old niece on our family WhatsApp finding normal things hilarious that are funnier than anything and I would include them here were it not a breach of her tiny dignity. That said, other people’s families are way less worried about baby privacy and this is a good example of the genre. These stories from Charlie Murphy of his Hollywood experiences are related hilariously by Murphy, re-enacted hilariously by Dave Chappelle, but the actual commentary from Rick James makes this a top-notch piece of comedy. Kate McKinnon is always funny and these sketches are funny, sad and funny. I love Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, I love Bec Shaw, I have mixed feelings about puns. This is a rollercoaster for me, every time, and Bec’s commitment to enjoying it gives me hope."
"The goodwill that inevitably greeted this double bill – a proper staged event with live music! – couldn’t quite hide the disappointment with the first half. Hannah Kendall’s opera The Knife of Dawn, originally staged at the Roundhouse in 2016, is a rather laboured and didactic piece that succeeds only in informing us about a largely forgotten moment in colonial history. It follows the aftermath of the 1953 elections in British Guiana, the first under universal suffrage, which were overturned by British authorities. The story is told from the point of view of the Guyanese poet Martin Carter, one of the many members of the victorious People’s Progressive Party who was jailed. He is on hunger strike and is starting to hallucinate, haunted by offscreen female voices – his wife and daughter, other political prisoners, long-dead Guyanese slaves – who drive him to the brink of madness. Despite a fine performance by baritone Peter Braithwaite, the monologue lacks any dramatic momentum, mistaking showing for telling. We are told that Carter is a great poet, which he was, but it’s not evident from Tessa McWatt’s excruciating libretto, which spends an hour outlining the historical background and ends just as it starts to explore any artistic and emotional ramifications. Much more effective is the second half of the bill, New Dark Age, in which existing compositions by three leading contemporary composers are reworked into a 10-part song suite that narrates post-pandemic life, accompanied by Grant Gee’s artful slow-motion film. The only original piece is Anna Meredith’s swooping Fly By Night, but even the compositions that are more than five years old, such as Missy Mazzoli’s quartet from Vespers for a New Dark Age, setting poems by Matthew Zapruder, seem to have an eerie post-Covid resonance. The shimmering Vivaldi-meets-Philip Glass textures of Meredith’s Stoop seem to sum up a locked-down population straining to enjoy the bright sunshine of April 2020, while Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s two choral pieces – a blend of austere medieval plainsong and holy minimalism – serve as a threnody for the victims of the pandemic. By the end of the suite, with Meredith’s bleak a cappella Heal You (text by Philip Ridley) and her icy, discordant, malfunctioning harpsichord-and-strings piece Low Light, the bemasked audience at the ROH seemed emotionally prepared for a second lockdown."
"Late-night hosts took aim at Donald Trump’s performance at the final presidential debate while also ridiculing his decision to leak footage of his 60 Minutes interview. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert was live after the debate and said that “the highlight for me is that we’ll never have to watch Trump debate ever again”. When speaking of the final tussle, he said: “It’s like dental surgery” except the president isn’t experiencing toothache, “he’s hurting for cash” after news emerged that the campaign was forced to cancel TV ads because of a shortage of funds. “After tonight his best hope for advertising is standing on a street corner with one of them flippy arrows,” Colbert joked. Throughout the debate, Trump spouted mostly fabricated numbers, as per usual. “The president has numbers even though the numbers don’t make any sense?” Colbert asked while showing footage of him claiming that 99.9% of young people survive the coronavirus with no problem “You know old people are the ones that vote, right?” Colbert joked. Trump also called New York a ghost town. Colbert countered: “When you come to New York, those aren’t ghosts on the street, those are people booing you.” The president also complained about restaurants using Plexiglass protection for diners. “Trump doesn’t want to be wrapped in plastic, it ruins the feeling. And if it breaks, you wind up with an Eric,” Colbert joked. When Trump’s many accounts and many losses were brought up, he said he “was a businessman doing business”, which amused Colbert. “Trump sounds like three kids stacked in a trench coat trying to be an adult,” he said. Trump also tried to claim Joe Biden was lying about where he came from. “Where do you think Joe’s from? Nairobi’s big Irish Catholic neighbourhood,” Colbert joked. By the end, he reminded his audience that “the ultimate mute button is in your hands”. On Late Night, Seth Meyers talked about Trump’s week of “whining about the moderator” while also releasing “deeply embarrassing footage” of him having a tantrum during a 60 Minutes interview. Meyers called it “genuinely one of the most embarrassing and cringe-inducing things I’ve seen on video”. During the interview, Trump couldn’t come up with details on how those with pre-existing conditions would be protected without the Affordable Care Act. “He doesn’t have a plan to protect people with pre-existing conditions, he has a plan to give people pre-existing conditions,” Meyers said in reference to his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic. He has continued to refer to “a bogus criminal investigation” into the Biden family, calling Joe a vacuum cleaner who sucks up the money his son Hunter has left for him. “You don’t get to call anyone else a vacuum cleaner when every time you give a speech you suck in air like a Dirt Devil,” Meyers said. He also compared his tactics to exactly what he did with Hillary Clinton in 2016. “Trump’s like the guy who uses the same pickup line on every woman he meets because it worked once in 1990,” he joked. Meyers moved on to Rudy Giuliani, the “Italian Wile E Coyote” who was caught in a compromising situation in the new Borat movie. “If Rudy hadn’t been tricked by a Sacha Baron Cohen character, I would have assumed he was a Sacha Baron Cohen character,” he said. On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah spoke about Trump’s embarrassing 60 Minutes footage. “I don’t think it shows what he thinks it does,” Noah said. Before the interview started, Lesley Stahl asked Trump if he was OK for some tough questions and he said no he wasn’t. “It’s like at a concert when they go ‘Are you ready to rock?’, no one in the crowd is like, ‘No thanks Mr Bon Jovi.’” He continued: “Only Donald Trump would think he could choose the level of difficulty of his interview questions.” Noah said it was as if “he thinks it’s like picking the spiciness of his Chinese food”. He finished by saying: “What blows my mind the most is that Trump posted this video, thinking it somehow makes him look good. It’s like making your Tinder profile a picture of you crying in the shower.”"
"Judith Hughes, a Melbourne Theatre Company subscriber, sees seven shows a year, organising tickets for a group of 11 women with an average age of 65. She is eager for the company to reopen its doors. “The general feeling among our group is that we’ll do what we can to support the arts and we want to get back in the theatre as long as we can do it safely,” she says. Anecdotally, the sentiment seems shared by theatre audiences across the country. Mitchell Butel, artistic director of the State Theatre Company of South Australia, says demand for its first post-Covid shows, Gaslight and Ripcord, have been “through the roof. We were the first main stage back in the country and we had no seat to sell.” Box office statistics supplied by the Sydney Theatre Company show that three quarters of ticket buyers for Wonnangatta, its first post-lockdown show for 2020, had bought tickets to the company’s pre-Covid season.  But the enthusiasm isn’t necessarily reflected in other data. An Australia Council for the Arts sponsored survey tapped more than 12,000 arts lovers nationwide and 150 arts organisations. It included galleries and museums as well as performing arts groups and was taken three times, in May, July and September. Its September figures for attending cultural events as a whole were more confident than the previous two surveys, but show an understandable short-term caution. Despite a theoretical willingness to engage, only 29% of audience members surveyed were ready to attend an event as soon as permitted, with 29% of those who are residents in states where venues are open having attended a cultural event in the past fortnight. Only 14% were actually buying tickets for live shows and performances. But the production costs of putting on a show remain the same, whether you’re playing to 50 people or 500. This is a crucial factor influencing theatre companies’ programming and projection of box office revenue for 2021. How many tickets can they reasonably expect to sell in a limited audience return? Covid has also disrupted the subscription funding model that a majority of companies rely on. In a normal year, the theatre companies would be in the middle of launch season, with tickets for much of 2021 going on sale for subscribers to buy in packages of several shows at once. The funds brought in during the subscription period would then go into the budget for the following year. STCSA will launch its full 2021 season on 29 October but other companies are holding fire, with plans for limited season launches selling in stages, and with smaller subscription packages for those reluctant to commit long-term in an environment of uncertainty. This isn’t great for the bottom line, and it hasn’t helped that the only money spent from a $250m rescue package for the arts promised by the federal government back in June has gone to the screen industry. Of all the companies, those in Melbourne have dealt with the longest lockdowns and the harshest restrictions. Melbourne Theatre Company’s largest proportion of subscribers – 34% – are between the ages of 50 and 64, an age bracket more at risk from Covid complications. “It’s awfully challenging,” says MTC executive director Virginia Lovett. “At the beginning we went in hard and fast [with cancellations]. People re-booked for September, when we hoped to reopen, but we’ve had to cancel the rest of the year.” In pre-pandemic days, Australia’s not-for-profit performance companies were expected by funding bodies to be as commercially profitable as possible, to build up philanthropy and sponsorship income, and reduce their reliance on subsidies. Federal and state government subsidy more generally varies from theatre to theatre and this funding depends on the legal status of the company. Both STCSA and Queensland Theatre Company are statutory bodies, set up by acts of state legislation, and have greater state support; Melbourne Theatre Company is technically a department of the University of Melbourne, although both it and STC, a public company limited by guarantee, receive similar levels of government funding: between 6% and 7%. Many companies emphasise their box office revenue as a sign of this model working. MTC’s 2019 annual report touts box office receipts of $18.1m out of total revenue of $28.3m. For some state theatres, subscriptions represent an average of 50% of box office revenue. For the MTC, it’s 70%. The figures are the result of a campaign over the past few years that saw subscriber numbers grow 40% in 2018 to a high of 22,300, before dropping off last year to 20,315. Lovett is pessimistic about the ability of theatre companies to sustain revenue in a downward-turning market. “The recession will also mean a drop in sponsorship, philanthropy and corporate entertainment,” she says. This, she argues, means that the current government subsidy isn’t sufficient for what the company is expected to deliver during and in the aftermath of a pandemic. “It has to be between 15% and 18%,” she says. “If the governments are serious about us continuing to be a thriving part of the culture and want us to develop new work, be involved in education and touring, the subsidy has to increase.” Lovett says that MTC’s own research shows strong support and loyalty from existing subscribers, many of whom donated the cost of their cancelled tickets to the company. “They want to see good social distancing and we’re looking closely at what other theatres are doing,” says Lovett. “There will be a certain percentage who are very hesitant, but optimistically there is a very high number willing to return.” "
"Ah yes, the internet. A dreamspace. A wonder of technology. A glorious vehicle for my ex to write on my Facebook wall, “I drew you a bunch of sick skeletons and astronauts but the trams are down in Bundoora so I’ll come deliver them tomorrow. Stay cool,” instead of visiting me in hospital and then using that very same internet to disappear for four years. She is many things, the great W Dot. Let me draw you a warm bath of my favourites. Chris Fleming is one of those polarising geniuses. He continues to make music when it is definitely not in his skillset. Despite this, he has created this Meatloaf-esque power ballad about an accountant with a cough. This is an anthem. Throw your damn hands up. His “Company’s coming” video is also a treat. I mean, it’s exactly what it says on the box. She feels pretty, she’s a Jet, she’s a Shark, and she is both halves of a forbidden love. There is a lot we can learn here about loving ourselves. The editing on this is so good. The rhythm of this comedy is almost like a song. The kids are spot on too. Oh my god I love this video. The way she says “They only live at night” is *chef’s kiss* perfect. You should also check out the Hello My Name Is series if you enjoy this as much as me. Honor Wolf and Patrick Durnan Silva are Hot Department. It was so hard to decide which video to feature because they are all perfect and also because they are highly explicit and I wasn’t sure what would be allowed through the gates. Their comedy is best described as chaotically horny. Check out Honor Wolf and Hot Department on Instagram and TikTok for the full suite. They have a porn parody called Stepmom Blues on YouTube that you can watch at your own risk. There is a bit in the song Astonishing from the musical of Little Women where the character stops singing and says very dramatically, “Christopher Columbus!”, before belting her absolute tits off. It is the essence of what people love and hate about musicals. This supercut of people really giving it for just that bit is so funny to me and may mean nothing to you but this is my article. I do not have TikTok but this dog is so funny it made me download the app. He goes to bark without realising he is underwater and dogs aren’t made to drink this way. He’s fine, I know this because my dog does this all the time. The way she screams “Noooooo!” every time he comes near her. What a perfect little dream. Jude has such a great voice. I’m a sucker for musical comedy. Jude dancing around Broden Kelly’s Hamish is so sweet and cringey. Jude is the most underrated person in Australia. If you enjoyed this, also check out Gillian Cosgriff. Jordan Firstman’s impressions on Instagram are world class so I wasn’t surprised to learn that he wrote this incredible song. The way Laura Dern reacts as she slowly realises what is happening is so sweet I don’t know if I want her to be my wife or my mum. It’s obvious that Aunty Donna rule the internet comedy space but everyone knows we are friends so I didn’t want to put them in for fear of being biased. Unfortunately the perfection of Montaigne’s soaring vocals and their rambling verses has forced my hand and so now you have to watch this. Follow Michelle Brasier on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook"
"“As the election day barrels down on us like an out-of-control manure spreader, one of the last chances to influence the race is this Thursday’s presidential debate,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. After a widely panned first debate in which Donald Trump interrupted the moderator Chris Wallace and Democratic opponent Joe Biden a whopping 128 times, the commission on presidential debates announced the institution of a mute button to silence the opposing candidate’s microphone during two-minute responses (“open discussion” portions of the debate will proceed as normal). “While we’re at it, how about a fast-forward button?” Colbert wondered. “Just zip straight to November 3.” Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, blasted the rule change, calling it the commission’s “latest attempt to provide advantage to their favorite candidate”. “Enforcing the rules isn’t giving someone an advantage,” Colbert responded. “That’s like saying ‘the Olympic judges are playing favorites because they won’t let me throw bricks at Michael Phelps!’” However, the mute button could end up helping Trump, Colbert added, as his debate prep team has reportedly coached Trump to stop interrupting Biden and appear more “likable”. “Hold on, NOW they’re trying to make Trump more likable?” Colbert said. “He’s been president for almost four years! That’s like a firefighter showing up to your house and saying, ‘OK, let’s wait for everything to burn to the ground, then sprinkle a little water on there and see what happens.’” Meanwhile, as coronavirus cases rise sharply across the nation, Trump continued to brush aside the emergent third wave of the pandemic. At a rally on Monday night, Trump claimed America was “rounding the turn” on coronavirus, despite rising hospitalization numbers in 41 states. “Really? Rounding? Have you seen the Covid spikes?” Colbert retorted. “We’re not rounding the turn. I’m pretty sure we’re sharpening the turn. What we’re looking at here is a razor-sharp turn.” Instead, Trump has pivoted away from talking about the pandemic because, as he said, “people are pandemic-ed out”. “That’s quite a rallying cry when we’re facing an existential threat: ‘We’re tired of it!’” Colbert joked. The decision by the commission on presidential debates to mute candidates’ microphones during standard two-minute responses is “the same strategy my daughter’s teachers use for Zoom kindergarten”, joked Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night. “Would a mute button even work on Donald Trump? I feel like if you turn off his microphone he’ll just pull another one out of his hair or something.” Trump has predictably lashed out about the rule change on Fox News, where he claimed the decision was evidence of the commission’s bias against him. “Before every debate, every election, every interview even, he announces that they’re plotting against him,” Kimmel explained. “And in this case, even the guys who are running the sound system are plotting against him.” In two Fox News call-ins, Trump claimed the commission unfairly “modulated” and “oscillated” his microphone during the 2016 debates. “They oscillated it, they modulated it, they constipated it,” Kimmel joked. “These microphones are out to get the president – it’s a total pitch-hunt.” A better question, Kimmel added, is “how many months after he loses do you think Fox & Friends just stops taking his calls live on the show?” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also found the installation of a debate mute button to be probably futile. “Trump doesn’t care if you mute his microphone,” he said. “He’s just going to shout. Or even worse, he’ll just walk over to Biden and use his mic. He’ll probably lick it too just to mark his territory. “Clearly, Trump needs to enjoy his open mic time while he can,” he added, which is why Trump continues to hold large, in-person rallies across the country even as coronavirus cases surge. Despite outbreaks tied to his rallies in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in Minnesota, Trump has dismissed safety concerns because, as he claimed in a rally this week, people are “pandemic-ed out”. “Trump is not wrong about people being tired of the dealing with this pandemic,” Noah said. “But what he doesn’t seem to realize is that unlike the rest of us, he can actually do something about this. Instead, he’s acting like he’s as helpless as everyone else is.”"
"With The Late Show, Late Night, and the Daily Show all on vacation on Monday night, Jimmy Kimmel alone recapped the Los Angeles Lakers’ seventh NBA title and the president’s most recent antics. Monday marked the holiday formerly known as Columbus Day, now Indigenous Peoples’ Day – a fitting occasion for Trump to declare himself Covid-free, as the president and the 15th-century explorer “actually have a lot in common”, said Kimmel. “They both spread disease, and they both failed spectacularly at what they were hired to do.” The “contaminator-in-chief” was in Florida on Monday night to host a mask-less rally, which he claimed was OK-ed by doctors. “That’s good news, though – it’ll be nice to get back to having a president who’s only mentally ill,” Kimmel deadpanned. Since returning to the White House after a weekend stay at Walter Reed medical center, Trump has spun his bout with Covid, which was treated with top-of-the-line medical care, a personal team of physicians, and an intense therapy regimen – into a narrative of invincibility. The president called into Fox News over the weekend to brag that he felt “good, by the fact that the word immunity means something, having really a protective glow means something.” “It’s not a protective glow, though,” Kimmel responded. “That is Hawaiian Tropics mango-scented tanning mousse that you’re seeing.” And “if it sounds like Trump is trying to position himself as some kind of superhero now, um, listen to this,” Kimmel added, referencing a New York Times scoop over the weekend that Trump had discussed with advisers an idea for a laughably theatrical exit from Walter Reed hospital: a stunt in which the president would appear frail as he exited the hospital, only to rip open his button-down shirt to reveal a Superman T-shirt beneath as a show of strength. “This is not a joke. This is what he wanted to do,” Kimmel said of proposed stunt. “Whoever talked him out of this, I would like to bang you right on the head. “What would happen when he reveals the S on his chest – would the country erupt in applause?” the host wondered. “Most likely, he would try to fly and wet his pants or something. Who thinks like this?”"
"How do you turn a handful of lip-sync videos on TikTok into a Netflix special? That’s the challenge faced by US comic Sarah Cooper, who made her name this year miming online to the words of Donald Trump. The trick drew tighter focus on just how weird the president’s speech (and his ideas) can be, with only the subtlest of send-ups required from Cooper – a changed context here, a glimpse of fleeting hysteria behind the eyes there. The hysteria is ratcheted up in Everything’s Fine, a faux morning news broadcast spliced with a psycho-absurdist trepan into the overheated mind of 2020 America. It torpedoes any concerns that Cooper might be merely a lip-sync novelty – although the lip-syncing does feature, notably in the scorching scene that brings Trump’s “pussy-grabbing” dialogue to gender-bending life. Helen Mirren, of all people, co-stars, as Trump’s wingman Billy Bush, among a hatful of glitzy stars that includes Ben Stiller as a robot CEO, Whoopi Goldberg and Marisa Tomei as Satan. Satan, you say? Yup, this is no ordinary newscast. For a while, it might be: it’s comedy first-base to send up the dorky content and Day-Glo smiles of daytime TV, as Cooper seems to be doing. But soon there’s more going on, from the news-will-eat-itself item reporting on (and interacting with) Trump’s tweets in real-time, to the Get Out sketch imagining Mar-a-Lago’s only black clientele. Cooper’s gaze isn’t confined to politics: there’s a droll sketch of a close-up magician struggling to entertain her Covid-safe drive-in audience. But the sinister keeps encroaching. On the shopping channel run by conspiracy nuts QAnon, you can bid now for a porcelain Ivanka Trump doll with Cooper’s panicky face superimposed. “If being complicit,” it intones, “is wanting to be a force for good and make a positive impact, then I’m complicit”. It’s a fever dream, then, of this tumultuous American moment, a vortex of murder hornets, racist cupcakes and gassed protestors into which Cooper and her vacuous bulletin finally collapse. Truly the anchor’s away – further and further away – in this often funny, always striking document of what living feels like in this fraught and febrile year."
"The first time I went to see it I think I had just turned 11 [Titanic had a 12 certificate]. I remember sneaking into the cinema for my birthday and my dad telling me and my friends how to act in front of the staff. He said: “If they ask you your birth date, you have to pretend it’s this day.” We watched the whole film and everybody was crying. My dad always tells the story of having these five 11-year-olds sobbing next to him. Really, it was my first emotional reaction to a romantic story. From then on, me and my friends got completely obsessed. We started collecting magazine cutouts of Leonardo, Kate Winslet, anything to do with Titanic. And then we studied the history of the Titanic. It just went on and on and on. Some friends were trading Spice Girls cards, but me and my other friends were just trading articles. It really went quite deep. Mariah Carey was my first musical obsession. My dad gave me the album Music Box when I was seven. I thought she was really beautiful and the artwork was brilliant. The first song I ever learned was her rendition of Without You. That’s the first time my dad said: “Oh, I think you’re quite good at singing.” I thought: “Wow, I’m going to be a singer!” After that, he was coaching me on how to convey emotion with my hands. He had me touching doorframes. It’s just so funny thinking of the seven-year-old me trying to convey the emotion of this desperate love song to my parents. My dad only showed me the biggest divas as I was growing up. He made it such a normal thing for me that a woman can sing, but also that it’s a requirement to write your own music. Having that in my head has kept me on the songwriting path. Now I look back and think, God, I’m so lucky that my parents had good taste in music, or knew what would excite a kid. I didn’t really get to see many people of colour on TV growing up. I think I saw Eternal on Live & Kicking or some other Saturday morning TV programme. I thought they were amazing. They were the first live act I ever went to see. It must have been 1995. It was in Aberdeen, in a small venue on top of Union Street. My sister was only a baby and fell asleep during the concert. It was such a brilliant night and my mum knew how excited I was to see it. I was in love with them and continued to be as their careers went on. When I did a show in the O2, Vernie [Bennett, one of the members] and her family came to watch. That was really exciting. This film changed my perspective. Being black and growing up in Scotland, it was always through different music or films that I could jigsaw bits of my identity together, even if they showed a completely different reality. I mean, New York is very far from Aberdeen. But Save the Last Dance gave me so many cultural references and I felt as if I belonged to a new kind of world that they portrayed. It influenced a lot of my fashion – my friends and I got bucket hats and Timberlands, New York streetwear, which you can imagine stood out quite a lot. It made me see that music can be this incredible communication between people from so many different walks of life. It made me dream a bit bigger and bolder with what I was doing. At 12 or 13, I was very shy and spent so much time alone, practising my music. I found this music community online. The cool thing was that you could use audio. Today we have WhatsApp and all of this amazing technology, but at the time, the fact that you could hear somebody from the other side of the world blew my mind. I was speaking to people in Cleveland, Ohio, and New York. I spent hours on this thing, it was so unhealthy! Going into these chat rooms was a way that I could test my chops a little bit: am I a good singer compared with somebody who is studying or singing in New York? What do they think of my voice? It was nerve-racking. There were so many voices that blew me away. I learned a lot about gospel music. I’m still friends with a lot of those people now; we’ve just switched over to Instagram. I’m not sure if Lauryn Hill counts as neo-soul because she’s such a mix of everything. But if she does count then she’s definitely my favourite neo-soul singer. I loved Jill Scott too. I first heard her on Trevor Nelson’s Rhythm Nation on Radio 1. I got such an education listening to that show. About twice a month, I’d spend lots of money ordering American import CDs of people I heard on it, such as Jaheim, Lauryn, Jill. I learned so much about myself through listening to neo-soul. Jill Scott really influenced how I approach music – the storytelling aspect of it. She had so much character and charisma in her lyrics. There was so much jazz influence in what she was doing, and she was such a beautiful, confident woman. And Erykah Badu’s Mama’s Gun blew my mind when I first heard it – the way she pieced that album together is genius. D’Angelo’s Voodoo is one of my favourite albums of all time. I remember one summer trying to learn how to beatbox like in Musiq Soulchild’s I Just Want to Sing. I remember listening to Floetry, too. The fact they were from the UK was so inspiring. I got to sing with the Floacist a couple of years ago. It was so nice to connect with a teenage hero. I really hope there’s a neo-soul resurgence, because I think it was such a classy, dignified genre of music that so many stories can be told through."
"In the red corner: Joan Crawford, who put rocks in her pockets in preparation for a scene in which Davis had to drag her across a floor in the film Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? In the blue corner: Bette Davis, who said: “[Joan] slept with every male star at MGM except Lassie.” There were no winners in this bitter feud, stoked by an industry that saw women as washed up by 30, but their pranks and putdowns were top-drawer. Heavy metal lunkhead locks horns with grunge gloomster, with undignified results. After Nirvana declined to open for Guns N’ Roses on their 1992 tour, a squabble ensued that culminated in a face-off at 1992’s MTV Video Music awards, during which Rose told Cobain to “shut your bitch up”, referring to the latter’s wife, Courtney Love. The sibling rivalry between these writers was fostered by their mother, who encouraged them to compete as children. As an adult, Drabble took umbrage at Byatt’s portrayal of warring sisters in The Game, while Byatt sulked at Drabble’s depiction of their mother in The Peppered Moth. The actors put on brave faces during their Sex and the City years, despite rumours that they were at war, but the cracks have since begun to show. In 2018, following the death of Cattrall’s brother, Jessica Parker sent her condolences, for which she was rewarded with a ferocious dressing down from Cattrall via Instagram. Memes followed, obviously. This spat between the US literary giants, prompted by Vidal’s unflattering comments about Mailer’s book The Prisoner of Sex, turned physical when Mailer headbutted Vidal in 1971. Six years later, Mailer lamped him again, prompting Gore’s immortal burn: “As usual, words fail him.” It began with Minaj liking an Instagram comment that seemed to poke fun at fellow rapper Cardi B, and continued with a series of lyrical disses. Later came a scuffle at a New York fashion week party, when a shoe was thrown and Cardi left sporting a bump on her head. All was not well on the set of the 1957 romantic comedy film The Prince and the Showgirl, where Olivier failed to hide his disdain for his co-star, despite acting being his actual job. While Monroe maintained a dignified silence, Olivier said of Monroe: “My hatred for her was one of the strongest emotions I had ever felt.” There has been bad blood between these two ever since West crashed Swift’s acceptance speech at 2009’s MTV Video Music awards. An apology followed, but their ruck was reignited with the song Famous, in which West made disparaging remarks about Swift. Kim Kardashian, wife of Kanye, later claimed that Swift had approved the lyric and called her a snake, an image the singer cannily adopted for her Reputation tour. Rolling pins at dawn! When Stewart – an author, entrepreneur and lifestyle guru – took a potshot at Paltrow for “trying to be Martha Stewart” with her company Goop, the actor didn’t take it lying down. Paltrow subsequently posted a recipe for “jailbird cake” on her website, a not-at-all-veiled reference to Stewart’s five-month stint behind bars in 2004. The beef between the 90s rappers was sparked when Shakur accused Smalls of organising a shooting at his studio. Various diss tracks followed, including Biggie’s Who Shot Ya? and Tupac’s Hit ’Em Up. Events took a shocking turn when Shakur was shot dead in 1996, and Smalls was shot six months later. Both murders remain unsolved."
"Artist Ralph Steadman’s work became synonymous with 70s counterculture due to his long association with the gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson. His distinctive political and satirical drawings have appeared in the New York Times, Punch and Rolling Stone. Steadman has created album artwork for the Who and Frank Zappa, designed an award-winning set of British stamps and illustrated special editions of Alice in Wonderland, Animal Farm and Fahrenheit 451. A retrospective artbook, A Life in Ink, is out this month.  Reluctant Genius: Alexander Graham Bell and the Passion for Invention by Charlotte GrayI much prefer to read about real people’s lives rather than fiction. Currently I’m reading this biography by Canadian author Charlotte Gray. It seems to have won a lot of awards, which I usually think are badges of mediocrity, but this is rather good – very well written and researched. Bell was a fascinating man and invented so much more than the telephone. A lot of his work involved sound, including sonar probes and fibre optics. This biography really brings him to life. Freak Power: The Ballot Or the Bomb I’ve just watched this excellent documentary by Daniel Watkins and Ajax Phillips. It’s about Hunter S Thompson’s political campaign to become sheriff of Pitkin County in 1970. All of the footage featured in this was only recently discovered and hasn’t been seen before. Watching it really took me back. What got me about the film was its representation of Hunter’s humour, that’s how I remember him. His manifesto of legalising marijuana, disarming the police and protecting the environment doesn’t seem so far out today. Those crooked Aspen politicians would fit right in as well. Ozgur in Tenterden This Turkish restaurant is in Tenterden, near where I live in Kent. Ozgur is a family tradition – we’ve been going there for around 30 years, for all our celebrations and birthdays. I love the fact that it’s been there so long that it’s become part of a wonderful community. Mustafa, who runs the joint, knows all the other shop owners along the high street, and eating there in the summer on the pavement outside you could hear everyone talking to each other up and down the street. I really like the liver and onions – an old-fashioned dish that my father used to love. Just a Minute, Radio 4 Radio 4 and the World Service play all through the night and most of the day in my house. It’s a soothing background and nice to wake up to. There was a special evening of programmes about Nicholas Parsons recently on Radio 4 that was just lovely. Parsons was such a nice, self-effacing man, but had an interesting life. Just a Minute, which Parsons hosted, is one of my favourite shows. Paul Merton is very witty and I love Sheila Hancock – she’s hilariously funny and quick. The Repair Shop I’m fascinated by this BBC show about experts restoring family treasures and heirlooms. How these craftspeople make things work is just incredible. I get so engrossed watching them work. I particularly like upholstery restorer Sonnaz Nooranvary, who does the sewing and restores old pieces of material. She puts the glow back into these things – you literally see this glow appear. I love watching skill in action. I have such respect for expertise. Outdoor swimming I hate sport but I love to swim. I have an outdoor pool – it’s not a far shore, but it’s been terrific for swimming in lockdown and I haven’t missed a day all year. That’s been one good thing about this germ-riddled limbo we’re in. I’ve swum all my life, since the cold, pebbly beach at Abergele in north Wales where I grew up, and Rhyl swimming baths. I really like doing the breaststroke. It’s good for the sternum and I like the feeling of your chest pressing against the water. The Comic Almanack: An Ephemeris in Jest and Earnest, Containing Merry Tales, Humorous Poetry, Quips and Oddities by Thackeray, Albert Smith, Gilbert à Beckett, the Brothers Mayhew The Almanacks are collections of humorous writing and illustrations. They feature the greatest authors and artists of the Victorian era, especially illustrator George Cruikshank. Some of the work he did for his friend Charles Dickens is in here. I’ve always loved old books. I used to go round all the junk shops on a Saturday morning looking for them. Then, when I was older, I got to know antiquarian bookseller Bernard Stone, who had the Turret Bookshop in Kensington Church Walk. All the writers used to go there, it was a great meeting place."
"When it was first suggested to Yuval Noah Harari that he appear as a character in the illustrated version of Sapiens, his mega-bestselling “brief history of humankind”, which is about to be published in graphic form, he did not jump at the idea. “I vetoed it,” he says over the phone from his home outside Tel Aviv. “I try to keep myself mostly outside my books.” Sapiens covers the broad arc of our species’ story, from the emergence of human cultures in Africa 70,000 years ago to our hyper-connected present, in 500 pages. It has been one of the most spectacular publishing successes of the past decade, selling more than 10m copies since it was translated into English in 2014, and its enormous popularity has turned a little-known Israeli history professor into one of the most influential public intellectuals on the planet. But for all his ambition and influence, Harari cuts a rather sober figure. Slim, bespectacled and shaven-headed, he speaks softly but insistently not just about our distant past but also of the near future of humanity and the various existential threats looming. “If Harari weren’t always out in public,” a New Yorker profile noted earlier this year, “one might mistake him for a recluse.” So it’s curious to see the 44-year-old appearing in Sapiens: A Graphic History, serving as an avuncular cartoon tour guide through the early days of humanity. On the opening page he greets us from an armchair, book open on his lap, ready for story-time; later he leads a fictional niece through the complexities of evolution and his theories on how an obscure savannah-dwelling ape rose to world domination. His co-authors on the new book, the French illustrator Daniel Casanave and Belgian scriptwriter David Vandermeulen, insisted Harari step into the frame. “They convinced me it’s a very efficient storytelling technique, and that it would make it easier to convey at least some of the messages if you have this guide who accompanies the reader.”  As a compromise, they agreed to include a cast of scientists “who could explain different disciplines and present different theories – it’s important to show science as a collaborative effort and not as an individual enterprise,” says Harari. Some, such as the Oxford anthropologist Robin Dunbar, a specialist in primate behaviour, are real figures who have shaped Harari’s thinking; but most are fictional. Among the cast are a masked superhero, Doctor Fiction, who personifies “the human superpower to create and believe in fictional stories”, and a hard-boiled New York detective “investigating who killed most of the big animals of the planet more than 10,000 years ago”. (Spoiler: it was us.) Sapiens grew out of an undergraduate lecture series on world history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where Harari still teaches, before becoming a bestseller in Israel in 2011. “The core ideas have remained the same” with each new adaptation, says Harari, though the illustrated version did give him “the opportunity to rethink some of the details – science has discovered a lot of new things over the past decade and a half”. It also challenged Harari to flesh out some of his original observations. “Texts can be very abstract, but when you draw, you have to be concrete,” he says. “So, for example, if you discuss sexual relations between Sapiens and Neanderthals, in a text you can avoid the question of, was it a Sapiens man with a Neanderthal woman or the other way around? What did they look like? It forces you to go back to the scientific research. And of course, it brings up a lot of issues, ideological and political, about race and gender. Even if you don’t have all the facts, you need to make a call. Some of the liveliest debates that we had were exactly about such issues.” Sapiens has already reached tens of millions of readers across nearly 50 languages. Now, in addition to the illustrated version, which will unfold over four volumes, Harari – who last year founded a social-impact company called Sapienship with his husband and agent-manager Itzik Yahav – is planning a history of the world for younger children; there is also talk of a TV adaptation of Sapiens and a touring exhibit. What is it about the book’s message that he feels is so urgent to get to an even wider audience? “I think it answers a crucial need,” he says. “Because we live in a global world, you need a big-picture understanding of history now to really understand your own life. Most educational systems basically just teach you the history of your country, your religion, your culture. I went through 12 years in Israeli schools and never heard a thing about the history of China, or about anything prior to Judaism. I don’t think I had a single lesson about the agricultural revolution. So people need this big picture, and Sapiens provides it in a way which we tried very hard to make accessible and interesting and fun.” Accessibility is key here. “When you look at what’s happening now in the world with Covid-19, and all the conspiracy theories, you see the importance of science reaching not just a small elite, but everybody,” he says. “One big handicap is that science is usually much more complicated than the conspiracy theories, and scientists often speak in jargon and numbers and statistics and graphs, which most people find difficult – people usually think in stories.” In the graphic version, “we remain faithful to the core scientific facts and theories, but we can experiment with new ways of telling the story, and thereby reach a wider audience.” Harari is aware that the success of his books has led some people to view him as a prophet, which makes him uneasy. “I keep saying, ‘I don’t know what’s going to happen.’ The whole point of writing books is to try to change the future, not to predict it.” However, he admits he feels fearful about what lies ahead. “In the long span of history, the Black Death and the influenza of 1918-19 were much worse. [Covid-19] is a relatively mild epidemic in terms of mortality. Its most dangerous potential is its impact on our ability to deal with other threats. Nuclear war, ecological collapse and the rise of disruptive technologies like AI – these three threats can really destroy human civilisation if we don’t handle them correctly. And all three demand global cooperation to deal with them. If we react in the wrong way to the present crisis, it will destroy whatever remains of global cooperation; it will create a poor, violent world, which will not be able to have a common plan of action against global warming or how to regulate the explosive potential of AI. That’s the most dangerous outcome of all this.”"
"There are two versions of the comic Rob Brydon: Television Personality and Twickenham Dad. And although the two identities have lived hugger-mugger inside him for decades, occasionally overlapping, “like tectonic plates”, says the 55-year-old, they are rarely seen out in public at the same time. I’m lucky this afternoon that I get to meet both Brydons: the performer, who is polished and smiley if a touch remote, as well as the softer, more relatable father-of-five. It’s Twickenham Dad I meet first. When I come up on Brydon on a London street he is peering through the window of a home-furnishing showroom, taking pictures of a nice bit of garden furniture that’s caught his eye. This furniture looks to be hewn out of stone and (we both note) has no obvious price tag. “So whatever you think it costs,” says Brydon, in his measured and pleasing Port Talbot accent, “add lots of zeroes on.” He is wearing a fitted, felty suit and has his charcoal hair neatly parted. The enduringly youthful face, lightly scarred from teenage battles with acne, is mostly covered by a pale pandemic mask. He removes the mask once we’re seated in a nextdoor restaurant. Angling his thick-framed bifocals, Brydon studies the menu, taking an age to choose and dramatising his indecision for the waiter’s amusement. “Who knows!” he is muttering. “I might treat myself to a little pudding. That changes, as you get older, your love of puddings. Oh! There’s too much that looks lovely. Make a decision, man. OK. The seabream. The seabream, please. The seabream.” He’s hungry, having woken early this morning to appear on breakfast TV, there to talk up a live tour (due to start next spring) and a series of YouTube interviews he has recorded with friends and colleagues from the entertainment industry. It occurs to me, listening to Brydon’s twinkly and enjoyable anecdotes about dawn wake-up calls, soundchecks, unintentionally patronising producers, that breakfast telly is about the only job in showbiz he hasn’t tried over a multi-decade career. To date, Brydon has starred in influential British sitcoms that are mainstream (Gavin & Stacey), niche (Marion & Geoff) and deep niche (Human Remains). At the start he was a radio presenter, then a shopping-channel presenter, then a quiz-show presenter, then the disembodied voice on the Beeb who said chirpy and forgettable things between the end of the news and the start of Match of the Day. For decades, he has narrated ads, for soft drinks, for breakfast cereals. In his new YouTube series he revisits a skill for interviewing that he first developed as host of the Wogan-like Rob Brydon Show, which ran between 2010 and 2013. He currently helms a comedy panel show, Would I Lie To You? and over the years he has toured (in and out of character) as a standup, a musician, and a musician who does standup between songs. Since 2010, Brydon has improvised his way through four series of The Trip, an intense two-hander, co-starring Steve Coogan and devised by director Michael Winterbottom, that is one of the most interesting, infuriating, sustainedly weird creative projects in recent TV history. Oh, and Brydon does impersonations, too. “Gotta-find-the-monkey, gotta-find-the-monkey,” he is saying at the restaurant table, pretending to be Dustin Hoffman in the 1995 virus movie, Outbreak. “Hruff! Hruff! Hruff!” he says, impersonating Boris Johnson as part of a story about the time he met the Prime Minister in a corridor. “It was at a thing, a party. We were passing.” Instead of any sort of conventional greeting, Brydon recalls Johnson pointed a finger at his chest and said the word “funny” several times. “I think I nodded. I can’t remember what I said, but I didn’t stick around, because I didn’t want to… I didn’t want to, um… I suppose I didn’t want to be charmed by him, if I’m going to tell the truth.” Brydon frowns. Typically he steers clear of political chat. A look at his 2021 tour schedule might explain why: this comic has broad, cross-demographic appeal and out on the road he’ll be visiting more Brexit- and Boris-voting constituencies than not. Anyway, something about the way the government botched the closure of theatres at the start of lockdown really irked him. Brydon was on tour at the time, warming up in Guildford when Johnson held that notorious press conference in late March, “the one where he recommended people didn’t go to the theatre, he didn’t say they couldn’t go. (At the time this was felt a cowardly move, potentially blocking insurance payouts.) It put venues in a dreadful position,” says Brydon. He remembers having to tell the band of musicians he was travelling with that their weeks-long tour was off. He gets tearful talking about it now. “I could see it in their faces. They were thinking of the loss of income. It was sobering. Really sobering.” In the manner of a fellow-traveller, Brydon will acknowledge that Johnson (“Let’s not call him Boris, please, because it softens him, like all the Wodehouseian nonsense that he does”) was a decent TV comic himself, back when he would occasionally host panel shows. “Johnson was good on TV. He should have stayed there. On TV? Fill your boots, good for you, have all the character flaws you want. But not in the slightly more important job you occupy now, please.” As a boy growing up in Swansea and later Port Talbot, Brydon would sing along to David Bowie in the family car. “It’s a god-awful small affair…” One day his mother, a teacher, interrupted him: “It may well be. But we won’t have that kind of language here.” He had half an eye on London and at 18 he travelled there to audition for Rada. He performed a piece from The Homecoming, but it didn’t land and he crept away defeated. Years later, spotting Harold Pinter in a restaurant, he approached the notoriously touchy playwright and risked a joke. “I can’t help thinking that if you’d tried a little bit harder with the writing, things might have been different for me.” Pinter, to Brydon’s terrific relief, chuckled. He was always good at making people laugh. Accepted into another drama college, in Cardiff, he remembers being picked out by his peers as “the funny one. I can’t overstate how much I thought I would do when I began.” In fact, Brydon left college early to work in radio. Through his 20s he “scrabbled around” on the fringes of the industry. He was married with three children when, in 1996, he auditioned for Spitting Image and got down to the last three, no further. For the most part, “I couldn’t get in the door of casting rooms. All I had to offer was little parts in sitcoms that amounted to nothing; little parts that a nice well-trained Labrador could have played.” He recalls an evening at home in the mid-1990s, when he was watching BBC2 and he saw Coogan as Alan Partridge in an early episode of Knowing Me, Knowing You. “I got off the sofa and I knelt, to be closer to the TV. I knew how good this was.” A few years later it seemed miraculous when a tape he’d made of himself performing character sketches found its way into Coogan’s hands. Coogan wound up producing two comedy series featuring Brydon: first Marion & Geoff (co-created with Hugo Blick) and then Human Remains (co-created with Julia Davis). There was another kneel-on-the-floor moment, in 2000, when Marion & Geoff broadcast to genuine acclaim on BBC2. “It changed everything. I was 35. My contemporaries had soared past me.” Now he was felt to be a rising star. And he was buds with Alan Partridge. “I was quite green at the time. I think I was quite provincial. I’m quite a late developer. Physically and, I don’t know, emotionally maybe? When I first met Steve it was very much as a fan. I remember, first hanging out with him, my frustration at his reluctance to engage in anything comedic. This man with these prodigious gifts! I would want to do bits with him. And he’d never do bits. He’s not one of those guys.” Brydon is one of those guys. As an interviewer you come to recognise his comedy bits tend to intrude whenever he wants to speed through or skirt an awkward discussion point. We’re talking about what it was like to experience seismic upheaval during his 30s. (By 2006, Brydon was divorced and married to Clare Holland, with whom he has had two more children.) I say something careless about starting life all over again and Brydon adopts the persona of a Welsh schoolmaster, maybe one played by Anthony Hopkins, to chastise me. “Now, what you’ve done there,” says Brydon-as-Hopkins, lowering his head and pressing his hands together, “is you’ve assumed life is like this… [his hands come apart and he makes a soft percussive noise, like a bomb exploding] When in fact life is like this… [he slides his hands apart more gently]. Life evolves. It’s a slow shifting. So I wouldn’t say I started life again at 35. My first marriage ended. But it wasn’t this… [exploding hands]. It was this… [sliding hands]. As sensitive, and as untraumatic, as we could make it.” It was around then that Brydon put in a career-shaping performance as Uncle Bryn in two series of Gavin & Stacey. The culture-clash sitcom was created by Ruth Jones and James Corden, who wrote Brydon’s part with him in mind. Jones is from the same part of Wales as him and they had crossed paths as secondary-school kids, when they appeared together in amateur musicals. To this day, Brydon says, “If you put us together, we will sing.” This singing of theirs caused an uncomfortable ruckus last Christmas when the cast of Gavin & Stacey regathered for a seasonal episode watched by more than 17m people. Brydon’s character and Jones’s were in a karaoke scene in which they had to sing the Pogues song, Fairytale of New York. The uncut version of the song is considered inappropriate, by many, for its inclusion of a homophobic insult. In the version Brydon and Jones recorded they did not edit out the insult. (PinkNews: “More Than a Quarter of the Population Spent Their Christmas Watching Rob Brydon Unnecessarily Sing a Homophobic Slur”.) Jones has since made a persuasive case that it was all a matter of creative honesty. “We had to remain true to the characters,” she told the Sun. “And they’re not necessarily going to be completely politically correct.” I ask Brydon what he made of it. He says: “That’s the world we live in now. So you’ve got to be able to take it. It’s their opinion.” Ruth Jones was a guest on his new YouTube show and during their conversation Brydon described the filming of the Pogues song as one of the more emotional moments of his life. He had his childhood mate dueting beside him. And his eldest daughter was on set too, there as an extra… I ask him whether the subsequent upheaval changed or coloured that happy memory. “The filming happened in the summer. The fuss happened at Christmas, five months later,” he says. “The experience of doing it is wholly separate from the experience of how it’s perceived. And how it’s perceived depends entirely on who is perceiving it. So no.” Plates are arriving from the kitchen. First zucchini, then seabream, and several bowls of buttered sides. Of course, it brings to mind The Trip, so much of which featured lingering scenes of Brydon enjoying lavish meals. (And in storyline terms it was meant to be the Observer Magazine picking up all the bills.) When Winterbottom first pitched him and Coogan the idea in the late 00s, “We turned it down three times.” A pair of middle-aged men, playing lightly fictionalised versions of themselves, bickering over their food? “We said: ‘We can’t. There’s not enough to it.’” But Brydon remembers getting home from the first week of shooting and telling his wife: it might be all right. I think it has become Brydon’s best work, evolving from a sort of high-budget travelogue into a uniquely paced rumination on ageing and ambition, a study in friendship and rivalry that’s sometimes been unbearably raw. Because the same format is repeated endlessly – Brydon and Coogan veer between good-natured competitiveness (Who has the better mastery of obscure trivia? Who can do the better impersonations?) and reasonably serious personal attacks (Who has had the better career? Who has fashioned for themselves the better life?) – the show has come to have the depth of a novel. We can safely say, after a decade of episodes, that neither actor comes away looking especially sympathetic. We know we’ve been watching fictionalised reality, I say to Brydon. But, even so, it’s hard for the viewer not to carry away lingering impressions. That both of you use your comic personas as shields. And that you, Rob, are a little more…. “Go on,” says Brydon. “A little more what?” Relentless? “You mean with the impersonations and things? That’s Michael Winterbottom! He’s always saying, ‘Do another voice, do another voice.’ I’m fond of funny voices, but I certainly wouldn’t behave like I do in the show, not in a million years.” Brydon frowns. “Look, I don’t under-estimate the effect this programme has had on people, and how they form their opinions about me. But it doesn’t bother me. I don’t think it harms me. I can’t control it. So who cares?” In his industry, he says, he meets a lot of obsessional people, people who are driven in a way that he can’t fully identify with. “When I hear them talking about their new projects, y’know, that they’re ‘so into’, I want to tell them: ‘Do the work! Put it out there! Wonderful! But I don’t want to hear about it.’ The work should be over there…” Brydon waves a hand towards the far corner of the restaurant. (And with this, once and for all, the Television Personality part of him is dismissed from the table. Twickenham Dad, his smartphone full of pictures of patio furniture, will handle the rest of the interview.) “And over here you’re a chap who lives in a house with a wife and two children, and three more children scattered around in their endeavours, and you’ve got a cat, and a hamster, and that’s what matters… The way I think of my position in the industry, I don’t need to be Steve, or Ricky [Gervais], or Sacha [Baron Cohen], these explosive perkow guys. I’m pretty happy. I know that’s a bit dull. I know that’s a bit ‘meh’, as people say. But I’ve got five kids. My head can’t be everywhere. Does that explain it?” Yes, I say. “I love doing this job. I want to keep doing it.” We’re looking around for the waiter. “ But that’s about it. The work is there. We’re here.” So, he wonders, reading the clock on his phone, and glancing around for the waiter – do we have time for pudding?

"Opera Australia will launch its summer season on Thursday, still reeling from a turbulent past six weeks that saw the company hit with a slew of unfair dismissal cases, and its orchestra deliver a vote of no confidence in its concertmaster. Guardian Australia has learned that – in a bid to stop the forced redundancies of almost one-third of the Opera Australia orchestra’s 56 full-time employees – the musicians took the unprecedented step of holding a confidential ballot on 25 September to signal to management its unwillingness to continue working with the concertmaster and orchestra director Jun Yi Ma. According to the orchestra’s now-redundant principal clarinettist, Peter Jenkin, the musicians’ revolt was fuelled by anger at Ma’s alleged participation on a four-member panel that was formed to decide who to sack. The motion of no confidence, which has been seen by Guardian Australia, noted that such a course of action had not been taken lightly. “It is devastating that we find ourselves in this situation, but unfortunately Jun has demonstrated through his actions that his position as our leader is now untenable,” the motion reads. “Specifically, his role in the redundancies, his unwillingness or inability to communicate support to his colleagues, his unwillingness to meet with player reps, and his active attempts to undermine [the union] MEAA’s campaign to save the positions, make it clear that we cannot continue to support him.” As concertmaster, one of Ma’s roles is to be chief intermediary in any contentious issue between the players and a conductor, or company management. But his additional title of orchestra director – not a common title found in opera orchestras – appears to have placed Ma firmly in the managerial camp. The company’s chief executive, Rory Jeffes, was informed of the vote of no confidence – signed almost unanimously, sources told the Guardian – but the motion was never formally tabled to management. An OA spokeswoman declined to comment on the no-confidence motion, but told the Guardian the continuing Covid-19 crisis forced the company into making redundancies. “They were very difficult decisions for all involved and certainly not made lightly,” she said in a statement. The shortfall in players will be filled by casual freelance musicians, possibly including some of those who were only recently made redundant. In the face of a protracted shutdown brought on by Covid-19 in March, Opera Australia’s board approved cuts to all permanent positions across creative, technical and administrative operations in August, without the opportunity for voluntary redundancies. The bulk of remaining staff were placed on jobkeeper, and the company set in motion preparations to sell its Sydney warehouse in Alexandria and much of its contents, including costumes and props. By the end of November, the orchestra will meet as a whole for the first time in more than six months to begin rehearsals for the 2021 summer season. Its size will have shrunk by almost one-third, and the musicians will be squaring off with a concertmaster many may no longer wish to work with. “There is an expectation that a concertmaster goes in to bat for his musicians,” Jenkin told Guardian Australia. “If he was pushed into a corner [by management] to sit on that panel, then the right thing to do would have been resign, not move against his own orchestra.” Another musician, whose position was not cancelled and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said management had placed Ma in an impossible position. “He wears two hats, and as orchestra director he had no option but to participate,” the musician said. “But that doesn’t change people’s feelings of anger and disappointment in him.” Oboist Mark Bruwel, who had been with the orchestra for more than 30 years before being dismissed on 25 September, said there were deep concerns over the lack of transparency in the mass forced redundancy procedure. As president of the Symphony Orchestra Musicians Association [Soma] up until September and a former member of the orchestra’s work health and safety committee, Bruwel told Guardian Australia some musicians, including himself, believed they were sacked because of their union activities. “There is no doubt in my mind that people who were outspoken on issues were targeted in the elimination process,” he said. Jenkin, a musicians’ representative on the MEAA’s federal council, told Guardian Australia his case to the Fair Work Commission would argue that his dismissal was based in part on his union membership. The OA spokeswoman denied claims that redundancies were motivated by union activities of their members. “Decisions regarding these redundancies were solely based on the positions required by Opera Australia into the future in responding to this once-in-a-century crisis,” she said. “We appreciate the significant role that the union plays in the organisation and respect and support our employees’ rights to be a member of the union. “We consider that we enjoy a positive and productive relationship with the union and are continuing to work with them during these difficult times.” Jenkin and Bruwel are among as many as nine redundant OA musicians, choristers and crew who have so far brought cases of unfair dismissal against the company in the Fair Work Commission, with hearings beginning next week. On Monday, the federal arts minister, Paul Fletcher, met with Jeffes and the OA chair, David Mortimer, to discuss the company’s financial predicament. “Opera Australia, like many other institutions across the nation, is facing difficult decisions in response to Covid-19,” Fletcher told the Guardian. “While these decisions are for the board and management, the loss of any Australian job is always regrettable.” OA will receive $21.853m in recurrent federal funding in 2020 and that support would continue into 2021, he said. The Guardian has been given a copy of an email that was sent to OA staff – including the 16 musicians it had sacked – on Wednesday. The email called for expressions of interest to fill at least 13 newly vacated “temporary” positions in the orchestra, across woodwind, string, brass and percussion. The MEAA’s director for musicians, Paul Davies, told the Guardian the company was now scrambling to fill the very positions it purported were redundant in September. “There appears to be no real change to the operating model as claimed, but rather a brazen strategy to casualise the workforce and reduce wages and conditions,” Davies said. OA’s spokeswoman told Guardian Australia on Monday that previous OA employees were welcome “and indeed have been encouraged, to apply for any vacant seasonal positions that become available in the future”. Federal Labor’s arts spokesman, Tony Burke, said OA management needed to explain itself. “[They] should explain why just a few weeks after sacking permanent performers they’re now hiring temporary replacements,” Burke told Guardian Australia. “Arts workers deserve the same job security as anyone else.” Bruwel said he believed that Opera Australia “had committed an act of cultural vandalism” on the orchestra and the company’s chorus and crew. “There was an ideological as well as a financial agenda and [OA] very much took advantage of Covid-19 to run it.”"
"A beam of light shoots across the gallery space, projecting a series of zoomorphic figures onto a grainy, red surface. A dugong, a turtle, a fish and a small kangaroo glisten in the dark, barely distinguishable, as you might expect of artworks that are some 50,000 years old. These are the Dreaming stories of the Ngarda-Ngarli people of Murujuga country, also known as the Burrup Peninsula, which is home to the world’s largest concentration of petroglyphic rock art. “The rocks, they are alive,” says Yindjibarndi elder Tootsie Daniel of Murujuga, where three billion-year-old rock formations meet the vast Indian ocean. “They speak to us. They are living stories.” Tootsie is among more than 54,000 Western Australians whose “living stories” are weaved through the WA Museum Boola Bardip, which reopened on Saturday after a $400 million, four-year redevelopment. The perspectives of more than 70 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language groups are featured throughout the museum, an approach known as “two-eyed seeing”, where western and Indigenous knowledge are placed on equal footing. “I’m not aware of any other museum in the world that has surveyed this many people,” says Alec Coles, chief executive officer of Boola Bardip, which translates to “many stories” in Whadjuk Nyoongar. “We made a commitment from the very beginning to represent many diverse voices, many of whom had never been heard, let alone in this kind of institution.” Among the museum’s eight permanent exhibitions are a bounty of rare and world-first artefacts, including the largest meteorite collection in the southern hemisphere, Australia’s oldest grape vine and largest whale skeleton. It also includes the largest pieces of banded iron ore formations in the world and microscopic single-celled organisms, which Boola Bardip’s project director, Trish McDonald, says are “some of the earliest evidence for the evolution of life on earth.” But it’s the multiplicity of stories and ideas, rather than the objects, that set this 6,000 square metre museum apart. In this era of post-truth, where science is often dismissed and alternative facts flagrantly offered, museums can play a vital role in promoting evidence-based knowledge, according to Coles. “Museums are places that people tend to trust, where you can have some of these difficult conversations without the rancour and the bias that you see elsewhere,” Coles continues. “Of course, there will be some people who are upset or incensed by what they see, people who are climate denialists, for example. But that’s exactly the point. We want to encourage critical reflection and debate, to be a conduit for real stories, for healing, and ultimately, for truth.” Perhaps the most interesting of these “difficult conversations” takes place in the Changes gallery, which explores how economic activity has impacted our natural resources and Indigenous heritage, posing the question: is “for the good of the state” good for everyone? As the world’s largest producer of both iron-ore and liquefied natural gas, where the logos of multinational explorers shout from skyscrapers and “did you see the iron-ore price today?” is standard water cooler chat, mining holds a firm place in Western Australia’s identity. As Bill Johnston, minister for mines and petroleum, states in a display within the Changes gallery, “Our capacity to function as a government is directly connected to the success of the iron ore industry and so is the entire nation.” But with incidents like Rio Tinto’s destruction of the sacred Aboriginal site Juukan Gorge in May, and warnings that 100 more sacred sites, some predating the ice age, could be next in the firing line, there are concerns about the sector’s disregard for cultural and environmental assets. On a screen we see footage of a massive train hurtling across the Pilbara carrying iron-ore, likely bound for China or Japan. It is overlaid with an audio of July Hicks, an Eastern Garuma elder: “They’re going to have nothing left,” she says. “Nothing left to say, ‘This is where your descendants came from, this is where your elders lived.’ Because of mining companies just destroying the land.” Like many Australian cultural institutions, Boola Bardip receives funding from a roll-call of resources companies, including Woodside, Rio Tinto and the Minderoo Foundation, owned by mining businessman Andrew Forrest. While Coles stresses these affiliations have no bearing on Boola Bardip’s content, saying that issues are presented “without fear or favour”, there is no mention of Rio Tinto’s Juukan Gorge blunder or Woodside’s “relocation” of more than 1,700 pieces of rock art into a holding compound for their North West Shelf Project in 2014. A little further up the hall, the Connections gallery explores WA as a multicultural state which has the largest overseas-born population in Australia. It introduces Alicia Freudenberg, who escaped persecution during Hitler’s reign, arriving in Perth on a summer’s day in 1939. “After what we had been through, it was wonderful,” she said. A didactic wall panel bearing the UN Declaration of Human Rights issues a timely reminder that “All human beings are born free”, before the gallery transitions into WA’s modern record on refugees. Conflicting attitudes towards migration are brandished on placards: “We are boat people” and “Assimilate or leave”, interspersed with stories of refugees who built a life here from scratch, and those who agonise over an uncertain future in offshore detention. And downstairs, in a temporary exhibition situated between the Innovations and Reflections galleries, another kind of uncertain future is explored: that of the Covid-19 pandemic. The displays chronicle premier Mark McGowan’s stewardship, including his notorious hard border stance, which has so far protected the state from a second wave. “Covid has created this incredible sense of community here,” Alec says. “The world has shifted so much under our feet. And when that happens, where do we turn? We turn to nature, we turn to culture, we turn to science.” “Our public cultural and scientific institutions have never been more important. And I feel very optimistic about that here in Western Australia.”"
"It may be true that John Sessions – or John Marshall, as he then was – found Canada “cold and depressing” when he was a graduate student at McMaster university in the 1970s, but he spread warmth and good cheer among students and faculty alike in the English department, which I chaired at that time. The one-man shows that he loved to put on for us – endlessly inventive, sharply satiric and very, very funny – soon drew audiences from across the university. One sketch I remember was of “Queen Lear” demanding access to her palaces for “me and my 100 corgis”. McMaster can claim to have given John scope to hone his unique skills. It also helped to redirect his career. Two leading lights of drama on campus, Liz and David Inman, propelled him in the direction of Rada and raised funds to support him in his first year in London."
"What happens when an annoying narcissist has a spiritual awakening? Do they become different? Better? Or does real change require much more than learning how to meditate? Enlightened, starring Laura Dern, aired for two seasons on HBO from 2011 to 2013. Critics loved it, a third season was on the cards – but it never got the mainstream viewership it deserved and was cancelled due to poor ratings. Its biggest crime back then, it seems, was to be born too soon. Now streaming in Australia on Binge, it’s stood the test of time. When Enlightened first screened, streaming services were in their infancy and the TV landscape was more conservative and dominated by the risk-averse network model. These days female anti-heroes and shows that mash up comedy with drama are the norm. The premise is simple: a self-destructive woman, Amy Jellicoe (Dern), is having an affair with her boss and has a nervous breakdown at the office. A buyer at a major firm, she’s been demoted from health and beauty to the cleaning products department and is furious. When we meet Amy, she has mascara running down her cheeks, is crying in the toilets and then – with the strength that comes from sheer rage – manages to prise open the doors of an elevator to confront her cowardly boss. After taking a month out to attend a wellness retreat in Hawaii, she comes back enlightened and tranquil. Returning to the banally evil corporation where she once had an office and an assistant, Amy is working in the basement with all the other corporate misfits doing menial data entry work. Her enlightened state vanishes almost immediately. In many ways Enlightened depicts how humans are a work in progress. We might think we’ve changed, but a new challenge or an old trigger has the power to knock us back to our old selves. Dern plays a complicated character who is hard to like in the same way that Girls’ Hannah Horvath was. Amy means well, but the volume is up to 100 and she can’t read a room to save herself. Despite all the self-help books, her ego constantly gets in the way. She wants to save the world, but treats the people around her as expendable. She appears in some of her more obnoxious scenes like an early prototype of a Karen. Wanting to change the world doesn’t ease your character flaws. You may think you want to work at a homeless shelter (as Amy does in the first season) but you’ll still turn your nose up at the pay. This year Vox called Enlightened the stand-out performance of Dern’s career and the start of a run of excellent turns including in Big Little Lies and Marriage Story. The role of Amy was created especially for her by writer and co-star Mike White; it is Dern’s performance, and what she can do with her mobile face, that makes this show a must-watch. While Enlightened saves most of its satire for the corporate world, there is a more subtle critique of the wellness industry running through the two seasons. An idyllic (and expensive) retreat in Hawaii will take you away from your worries for a while, but it doesn’t take long for the glow to wear off. What these retreats often don’t prepare you for is life outside: your annoying co-worker (Mike White), your drug-addicted ex-husband (Luke Wilson), your beaten-down mother (played by Dern’s real life mother Diane Ladd). And they certainly won’t dismantle society’s social problems or structural inequalities. Over the two short seasons, Amy morphs not from loser to success story – or from unenlightened to spiritual – but from an individual seeking fulfilment to a social justice warrior who tries to change the system from within. That her quest and transformation happens while the character still remains annoying is part of the show’s intelligence – and its bravery. Viewers have become more accustomed to shows that deliver complex characters and more realistic endings. Here’s hoping Enlightened finds the audience it deserved the first time around.  Enlightened is now streaming on Binge "
"America’s rates of coronavirus cases continue to soar above those of other developed nations such as Canada, Trevor Noah reported on Tuesday’s Daily Show, a dismal reality partly attributable to reports over the weekend of un-distanced “Covid parties”, church services without masks and a packed Chainsmokers concert in the Hamptons. “Obviously, ordinary Americans should be taking this pandemic more seriously,” said Noah. “But in their defense, it’s hard to do that when this is the guy who’s setting the tone from the top.” Noah referred to Donald Trump’s retweeting earlier this week of a coronavirus conspiracy video inaccurately claiming hydroxychloroquine – that old friend – as a cure for the virus. Twitter subsequently flagged and removed the video, which featured Dr Stella Immanuel, a physician in Texas with, as reported by the Daily Beast, a long history of propagating bizarre, untruthful and anti-LGBTQ medical claims, such as that gynecological conditions like endometriosis are caused by people having sex in their dreams with witches or demons. “Yes, despite having the world’s top doctors at his disposal,” said Noah, “Trump has decided instead to trust a doctor who believes that people get sick because they masturbate and that vaccines are made from alien DNA. “And by the way, whatever you do, please don’t start running around saying that African doctors are crazy,” he added. (Immanuel was born in Cameroon and received her medical degree in Nigeria.) “This doctor, who’s from Africa, happens to be crazy. You can’t use her to judge all African doctors, the same way you wouldn’t want the world to judge America’s presidents based on one guy, would you?” Basically, America “has two choices right now”, Noah concluded. We can “limit the spread of corona by following the science” or “listen to the advice of internet randos like Dr Demon Sperm”. Jimmy Fallon also dug into the president’s misinformation campaign on Tuesday night. “In 14 tweets, Trump undermined Dr Fauci, dismissed face masks and boasted about hydroxychloroquine working again,” the Tonight Show host said of Trump’s Monday night Twitter spree. “What is he doing? Even flat-earthers think this guy is out of his mind. “It’s like Crazy Trump was away for a week, and then someone said ‘hydroxychloroquine’ three times,” he added. “It feels like we’re back to Scary Misinformation Trump. I prefer ‘Person, Man, Woman, Camera, TV’ Trump instead,” he said in reference to Trump boasting of a cognitive function test last week on Fox News. “I also liked Point to an Elephant Trump. He was fun.” Despite the Food and Drug Administration’s disavowal of hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus cure, “Trump won’t give up,” Fallon concluded. “He’s like your friend who never stops trying to make you watch the show they’re watching.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers checked in with the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back environmental regulations amid the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic. Given Trump’s bungling of the coronavirus crisis, “you could be forgiven for thinking he hasn’t been doing anything at all”, said Meyers. “However, he has been very successful at rolling back environmental regulations and weakening major conservation laws, all while Americans have been distracted by a global pandemic, because instead of pulling back on pollution when lungs are having their worst year since Mad Men went off the air, Trump has actually been doubling down on his dangerous agenda.” During the coronavirus lockdown in the US, the Trump administration has eased fuel-efficiency standards for new cars, frozen rules for soot air pollution, and leased public property to oil and gas companies. “It’s when Trump seems to be doing nothing that he’s at his most dangerous,” said Meyers. “It’s like when your kids are upstairs and they’re super quiet for way too long – you know you’re about to wallpaper over some sharpie.” The administration has continued to push anti-science policies despite the distraction of coronavirus, Meyers explained, which disproportionately affects people of color, and derive from Trump’s longstanding denial of climate change. “Trump’s view that global warming is a hoax is one of the only stances he’s been consistent on,” Meyers said. “That, and there’s no such thing as a tie that’s too long.” One of the administration’s “biggest and most audacious deregulatory actions” has been to gut the National Environmental Policy Act, a 50-year-old piece of legislation which requires federal agencies consider the environmental impact of infrastructure projects before they are approved, and allows residents to weigh in. Which demands our attention, Meyers concluded, especially in an election year: “The Trump presidency will be over some day, but the sad reality is that the environmental effects will be permanent, and that becomes everyone’s problem.”"
"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all John Cleese recently went on a tirade against critics, lambasting them as “ignorant”, “envious” and “untalented”. If you’re an arts critic, you’ve likely been the recipient of this age-old insult before. Read the comments section – that confidence-knocking hellscape we pretend to ignore but prong like a tongue on a wobbly tooth – and you may be greeted with worse. However, is there any truth in it? Are we a bunch of bitter, resentment-filled failures taking revenge on those we secretly envy? It might be difficult to grasp that writing a magazine cover could appeal more than featuring on it, but for many it truly does. Sure, there might be adolescent periods when critics found themselves mimicking Leonard Cohen in their bedroom or painting wannabe Georgia O’Keeffes in the garage. Yet for many, the surge of adrenaline comes from time spent with art, not creating it. Plus, if you’ve ever joined bands on tour, you’ll know it’s mainly schlepping heavy gear around and asking people for wifi codes. However, if you’re besotted by an art form to the point you feel compelled to write about it for – let’s be honest – a meagre living, then it’s no earth-shattering revelation that some may share the same passion for creating that artists do. Mark Cousins, for example, happily coexists as a film director and critic. The prominent art critic Jerry Saltz went to art school and dropped out – making him the archetypal failed artist as critic – yet his Pulitzer prize for criticism was likely not awarded due to his seething hatred and festering animosity towards those who’d made it. It was because of his commitment, knowledge, expertise and desire to further elevate art through written exploration and insight. Martin Scorsese sees the art in arts criticism to such a degree he has repeatedly hired critics to write his screenplays. It is a common misconception that arts criticism is about tearing things apart. The work often errs on the positive side – pick up any magazine and you’ll find an abundance of four-star reviews – but part of the process of panning for gold is encountering disappointment. Ultimately that’s what this job is: a search for beautiful art and to better understand it. The aim is never to go in wanting to dislike: you approach with hope, not hate. That said, the skills required to write about beautiful art are the same required to unpick failures, which explains the satisfying allure of a brutal review.  It’s also not entirely one-way. The Pretenders’ Chrissie Hynde was working for NME – writing what she called “half-baked philosophical drivel and nonsensical tirades” – before she gave it up to form a band. Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys swapped writing about pop stars to become one. Even Marilyn Manson started off writing about music, although perhaps when he underwent his makeup and leather-clad transformation the title Failed Music Journalist didn’t quite have the same ring to it as “God of Fuck”. So, are critics failed artists? Well, if you believe, as many of us do, that criticism is an art form in itself, then obviously it’s a no. If you believe otherwise, I’m sure we’ll be hearing from you in the comments section soon. "
"“We’ve gotta find every bit of strength that we have and never let it go,” urges the theme song of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, as it draws you into its warm embrace. It feels relatable in these times. Sure, the reason I need “every bit of strength” is to figure out how to work from home while parenting a small child rather than to save the universe from unspeakable evil, but it’s comparable. It’s one of many ways that She-Ra is perfect lockdown viewing. A reimagining of the 1980s spin-off of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, the reboot delivers colourful escapism that’s gripping and plot-driven while also leaving you with the sense that you’d dive right in and fight alongside the rebellion if given the chance. I originally tuned in when it began in 2018 because it looked like something my then four-year-old daughter might be interested in. By the time I discovered it was a few more steps towards terrifying than Bluey or Doc McStuffins, it had become essential family viewing. The show centres around teenage soldier Adora, who was adopted into the Horde as a baby and has spent her life in the Fright Zone training to fight to wrest control of Etheria from the evil princesses that rule the planet. Just as she is preparing to embark on her first real mission, she stumbles across a mysterious sword and meets Glimmer and Bow, enemies of the Horde. In a moment reminiscent of Mitchell and Webb’s “Are We the Baddies?” sketch, Adora suddenly realises she has been fighting on the side of evil and the people she considers family are terrorising Etheria. Her connection to the sword becomes clear as she realises she can transform into She-Ra, a mythical princess with superhuman powers. For all of its excitement and action, what I like best is the way it blurs the line between good and evil in a way that’s incredibly nuanced for what is ostensibly a children’s show. From Adora’s childhood best friend Catra, to the hug-loving butch Scorpia and even second-in-command Shadow Weaver who at first appears to be the epitome of an irredeemable villain, the members of the Horde are humanised and have as much depth to their characters as those in the rebellion. This depiction of the characters as complex people with varying amounts of light and shade makes the relationships, illustrated against a background of a war zone, come to life. While elemental princess Mermista and the flamboyant sea captain Seahawk provide much of the comic relief with their unlikely romance, it’s the way She-Ra openly centres queer love and romance that’s really powerful. From married princesses Netossa and Spinnerella, to Rebellion archer Bow’s two dads, showrunner Noelle Stevenson put her cards on the table early in the series and continued to develop queer relationships that become more and more central to the plot as the series progresses.  It’s something that is quite joyful to watch with a small child. After years of seeing Disney princesses marry copy-and-paste princes, being able to see my daughter connecting with all these diverse relationships has been wonderful. At the heart of the show is the relationship between Adora and Catra – fighting on opposite sides, they are at war for much of the show but through a series of flashbacks we see the depth of their connection as children and understand what they mean to each other. It’s a complicated relationship that’s tied up in friendship, hate, jealousy, power and love.  While the backdrop might not be of this world, the characters are as familiar as old friends, and finding every bit of strength that you have and never letting go is something we can all relate to, whether we’re fighting for our lives or just hoping to one day go back outside."
"Meta comedy, in which celebrities play fictionalised or “exaggerated” versions of themselves, is a mixed bag. The two-season Hollywood Darlings (featuring, among others, Full House’s Jodie Sweetin) never really took off, and despite the hype and nostalgia surrounding the Beverly Hills 90210 reboot, it too failed to pack a punch – even with nods to Shannon Doherty’s “drama queen” reputation. The same cannot be said for the show Episodes, in which Matt LeBlanc portrays himself as an actor subsisting off the fumes of his phenomenal Friends success. A satirical skewering of the Hollywood machine, Friends writers (and real-life couple) David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik brilliantly and gleefully pull back the curtains on television, with LeBlanc playing a heightened version of himself – but one that clearly riffs off public expectation. And while LeBlanc is the star, the show’s focus extends to the supporting players in a Hollywood’s star’s universe. Indeed, the pilot of Episodes quickly tells you what kind of show this is going to be: having just won a Bafta for their prestigious comedy Lyman’s Boys, the story of a boys’ school headmaster in love with a lesbian librarian, an English couple and writing duo, Sean and Beverly Lincoln (Stephen Mangan and Tamsin Greig), are approached by a puffed-up US network head, Merc Lapidus (John Pankow). He breathlessly heaps praise on them – “I love your show. I love it. Seriously ... I want to have sex with your show” – then convinces them to pack their bags and move to LA to show-run a US version of the award-winning series. But upon arrival, housed in an extravagant mansion once used as a set for a reality TV show, the Lincolns soon get the lay of the land: the network executive lackeys propping up Lapidus, similarly ebullient and flattering, admit that, well, Lapidus hasn’t actually watched Lyman’s Boys. This paves the way for the Americans to decimate what was a pathos-packed dramedy, replacing an esteemed old English actor with LeBlanc as a downtrodden high school hockey coach who has the hots for the librarian (no longer a lesbian). Oh, and now the show is called Pucks!. For meta comedy like this to work, you have to play with the truth but you can’t dispense with it completely. And in Episodes, LeBlanc is only too happy to appear imperfect, a little burnt from his time in the sun, wizened from years stumbling along the Hollywood hamster wheel. But rather than dissolve into pure parody, LeBlanc, who is most famous for his Joey Tribbiani pick-up line “How you doin’?”, neatly subverts the perception that he is Joey. His waters can run deep but, more importantly, he knows how to sell himself, and he’s not done being successful and famous. It’s understandable that celebrities playing themselves guard the privacy of their non-famous friends and family. But the genius of Episodes is its reliance on essential truths. LeBlanc’s personal life is a story thread but really what shines through is the show’s exploration of fame, and the ways in which Hollywood massacres pure intention, chewing and spitting out its talents, and creating entertainment by committee. It’s an astute cautionary tale: you can reach peak success but one day find yourself at the bottom again, wealthy but dissatisfied because you’ve tasted relevance. Meanwhile, part of the show’s strength is its supporting cast. There are the besieged Lincolns, whose dreams of a breakthrough are rapidly becoming a nightmare. As long-suffering second to Lapidus, Carol (Kathleen Rose Perkins) is the guide for both the Lincolns and the viewer. She eases us in, delicately, before slamming us with the truth: nothing in Hollywood is real – even the tall columns in the reality TV mansion. LeBlanc’s Pucks! co-star, Morning Randolph (Mircea Monroe), keeps her breasts fake and perky, and her age is Hollywood’s worst-kept secret. And honourable mention goes to Myra (Daisy Haggard), the network’s head of comedy, despite having no sense of humour or even the ability to crack a genuine smile. In place of thoughtful assessment, she contorts her face in wild confusion, perhaps wondering, like us, why anyone would willingly work in television. A scene in which she tries to give the Lincolns “some notes” after a table read is genius, showing us you can be good at your job but it means nothing if no one else is. Episodes draws generously from the creators’ insider knowledge. They know Hollywood’s fickleness and folly. With its very human, faulty characters, it joyfully holds these foibles up to the light. But it’s smart enough to know that any good story requires more, and with five seasons, there is plenty of opportunity to grow these characters into more than hopeless Hollywood off-cuts. "
"One of the most famous objects in the world, the Rosetta Stone, is to have its little-known gay history explored on public tours for the first time by the British Museum. The stone is known for its crucial role in giving the scholars Jean-François Champollion and Thomas Young the key to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. It has been in the museum collection since 1802 and is regularly named as the number one object people want to see. But the museum argues another character deserves his place in the story too: William John Bankes, a charming, adventurous and rich Egyptologist who was forced to flee Britain after he was caught having sex in Green Park with a soldier. Because of Bankes, the Rosetta Stone is being added to LGBTQ+ themed tours of the British Museum which began last year and have become hugely popular, said Stuart Frost, the museum’s head of interpretation and volunteers. “The first run of tours was booked out within an hour or two, demand was really high, volunteers enjoy doing them and we’ve had great feedback from the public,” he said. Frost sees them as a good vehicle for sharing new research with the public. “Sometimes it is new stories, sometimes it is highlighting stories which are just not very well known because historically they have been overlooked.” For that reason about 20 objects are being added to the tours, including the Rosetta Stone. The tours have stemmed from a gay history book written by Richard Parkinson, a former British Museum curator who was in charge of the stone for many years. He argues that “every object is potentially queer” and that it just takes some scratching of the surface to find connections. Frost said most people would not know “that a gay man was instrumental in making the Rosetta Stone one of the most famous historical objects in the world”. The actual text on the Rosetta Stone is strikingly dry: priests asking for a tax break. But its importance is immeasurable because it says the same thing in three different scripts, which allowed the early scholars to crack the code of hieroglyphics. Champollion and Young are rightly famous because of it. But the museum says it was Bankes who discussed the possibility that the texts on the stone might all say the same thing, and he correctly supposed that a recurring cartouche represented a royal name. An obelisk collected by Bankes and which stands in the grounds of Kingston Lacy, his lavish Dorset home, was used in deciphering the stone. Bankes remains a fascinating character. Described by his friend Lord Byron as the “father of all mischief”, he was forced to flee Britain in 1841 when, in his mid-50s, he was charged with “unnatural offences”. Because it was the second time he had been caught, execution was a real possibility. Other new objects on the tours will include an ancient Greek coin depicting the poet Sappho and a Roman lamp showing two women having oral sex, probably representing a male fantasy. There is also a 1777 medal of the Chevalier d’Eon, an 18th-century soldier, diplomat and spy who lived alternately as a man and a woman in France and England. The most recent is a “Bank of Duckie” nine-bob note, a fake banknote made for a 2008 club event called Gay Shame Goes Macho, featuring the gangster Ronnie Kray instead of the Queen. They join busts of the Roman emperor Hadrian and his lover Antinous, a gender-fluid depiction of a Babylonian deity dating from 1800BC, and arguably the museum’s most famous gay object, the Warren Cup, a Roman drinking vessel showing two scenes of men making love. The museum is planning for reopening after the government gave the all clear for museums and galleries to open their doors from 4 July. A formal date has yet to be announced but the LGBT+ tours will be among the first tours to restart, said Frost. In the meantime the possibility of having them online is being explored."
"In May, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age announced the recipients of a $150,000 arts criticism funding initiative from the Copyright Agency and the Judith Neilson Institute: five white-Australian culture critics. As a creative producer at Sweatshop Western Sydney Literacy Movement, where we coordinate the writing component of StoryCasters – a Diversity Arts Australia initiative that supports CaLD arts reviewers, which I had introduced the Herald’s arts editor to – I and many First Nations writers and writers of colour were deeply disappointed. We have been part of developing conversations around the monolithic white industry of arts criticism in Australia, and have watched again and again as nothing has changed. We were stunned that news outlets traditionally perceived to be progressive would not take this funding as an opportunity to diversify the pool. On Monday afternoon, Jack Callil and Bec Kavanagh, two book critics selected by the Herald and the Age, tweeted a joint resignation letter, expressing solidarity with non-white writers and acknowledging that the Nine papers had “missed an opportunity”. As Benjamin Law tweeted, this was a “genuinely sad outcome”. Most of us who took issue with the appointments were not attacking the white Australians who were selected: we are most interested in seeing the structural changes that will prevent it from happening again. It’s not as though the talent doesn’t exist. There are a multitude of Australian literary outlets run by and publishing critics of colour, including Sweatshop, Peril Magazine, Liminal, Mascara Literary Review and Djed Press. These publications and writers may not be on the radar of predominantly white outlets – but in a country where half the population comes from either a first- or second-generation migrant background, that’s what needs to change. For any institution with an overrepresentation of white staff, diversity quotas have been proven to work. Writer and lawyer Dr Randa Abdel-Fatteh advocates the importance of an intersectional and race-oriented approach to quotas in business and academia and her arguments are certainly applicable to the arts industry, where monocultural leadership seems to ensure monocultural hiring decisions. To repurpose Abdel-Fatteh’s argument, advocating for diversity quotas in the arts is “not about introducing a policy of affirmative action; it’s about shifting an already existing policy of affirmative action” from white communities to BIPOC communities. On Wednesday, the Nine papers confirmed the reopening of Callil and Kavanagh’s former positions, with the assurance that “the roles are posted more widely to encourage a greater diversity of applicants”. In essence, the response shifts the blame from the structural issues at the heart of the decision to the visibility of their call-out. This is the crux of the problem. Across all sectors of the arts, we are at a turning point in the conversation about diversity and race. Apologies and empty pledges are no longer enough. In the visual arts, Soo-Min Shim and Eugene Yiu Nam Cheung critique the whiteness of the Archibald prize and its absence of non-white winners, identifying the roots of the problem in the structures that govern and judge it. Cheung’s observation has stayed with me: “At the heart of the art world lies a machine that serves to only better the material conditions of white people.” The precision of this quote stings at the same time that it liberates. Seeing a gut feeling articulated so boldly is to feel heard as a person of colour in this industry. For too long, First Nations and artists of colour have felt gaslit whenever we speak up about racism and the structural barriers we face. In the literary sphere, Sujatha Fernandes analyses the positive coverage Jeanine Cummins’ American Dirt received from white Australian journalists at the Good Weekend and the Sydney Morning Herald. Fernandes argues that both journalists failed to adequately engage with the critical conversation around the novel’s depictions of race in America, or with their inherent biases as white Australians. Fernandes draws parallels between American Dirt and Australian author Anna Krien’s 2019 novel Act of Grace, in which Krien writes from the perspective of First Nations characters and people of colour. It says something of the Australian literary reviewership that Act of Grace has not faced a fraction of the nuanced discussion that American Dirt received. In the performing arts, Moreblessing Maturure shared a clip of comedian Josh Thomas talking about how difficult it is to find an actor of colour who is experienced enough to cast. Writer Brodie Lancaster called out the double standards on Twitter: Thomas had no acting credits before casting himself as the lead in Please Like Me, and neither did his best friend Thomas Ward, who co-starred in the show. Thomas has apologised for his comments and said he is committed to do better – but what this incident should reveal to all gatekeepers is that their selection criteria, purportedly based on “merit”, are more likely based on biases which, without meaningful structural change, will continue to shut out and shut down marginalised voices. The lesson continues in the film industry. Last weekend, playwright Michelle Law exposed the Sydney Film festival’s decision to award a “profoundly problematic” film, Mukbang, which she said contained racist scenes. In a series of tweets, Law explained how the film appropriates Korean culture to serve the story of a white person, and featured an illustration of a Black boy being choked by a white woman – which was silently cut after complaints. The Sydney film festival is yet to release a public statement, although Scanlen and the production team have apologised. “If more BIPOC creators and creatives were involved in all stages of production, this would not have occurred,” Scanlen said on Instagram. But as Law pointed out, there was another structural issue behind this film being deemed a winner: an all-white panel of judges. White Australian artists may individually apologise and pledge to do better, but nothing is changing at the top. The recent decision to axe ABC Life, a platform which championed diverse stories and viewpoints but was at the heart of a culture war waged largely by white gatekeepers, is the most recent example. Again and again, racially marginalised artists carry the burden of exposing the problems entrenched within this industry, while the institutions themselves remain silent. Change at a structural level is needed to prevent racism from occurring in the first place. Shirley Le is a creative producer at Sweatshop Literacy Movement.

"It is a point in favor of TV’s sprawling proliferation that one gets, in the course of a year, both a lush, serious historical drama starring Helen Mirren as Catherine the Great on HBO, and its tonal opposite, Hulu’s raucous, gleefully brutal The Great, which puts an asterisk right on the title card: “An Occasionally True Story.” The Great, developed by Tony McNamara, the writer of absurd court send-up The Favourite, cares little for the historical accuracy of the 18th-century Russian monarch. Its Catherine (Elle Fanning) arrives in the backward, hedonistic Russian court as a naive 19-year-old bride in 1761. The real Catherine was 35 and a mother by then, but that’s fine – free from the constraints of biography or pedantic seriousness, The Great’s occasional truth delivers, ironically, a more lasting impression of a real, flesh and blood princess – one slowly but determinedly amassing power, enlightened but ambitious to rule. It’s a counterintuitive and refreshing insight the show shares not only with its clear predecessors – The Favourite and Sofia Coppola’s 2006 film Marie Antoinette – but with other recent historical-ish content such as Apple TV’s Dickinson, or the new film Shirley. In these absurd, anachronistic or downright fictional depictions of oft-biographied historical figures – women frequently defined against the restrictions of their period – it turns out that the farther one strays from the record, the more clear and accessible the window into their character. Take, for example, one of the most effective highlights of The Great: 19-year-old Catherine, cinched in a corset and petticoat, silk shoes squelching in mud, arrives on a battlefield intending to cheer the soldiers with a flushed smile and a box of pastel macaroons. But the bloodied man she meets has lost his fingers and can’t grasp the cookie. “I’ll just pop it in your mouth,” Catherine attempts, baffled and floundering. “It’s pistachio, if that’s helpful.” The scene is comically rich for its obscene clash of opulence and suffering – the ludicrous macaroon box, the farce that is Catherine’s sincere scheme to appear helpful. Never mind that the real Catherine was a palace veteran by then, or that cream macaroons were invented in the 1930s. The historical record is absolutely beside the point; the show’s razor-sharp reveal is in Catherine’s laughable naivety, in the archly callous disregard of life, the clash of aloof power with Enlightenment ideals. The real Catherine was, indeed, absorbed by Enlightenment thinkers and a voracious reader who nonetheless consolidated power, a point conveyed with a highly anachronistic “FUCK!!!!” as she tosses the silly macaroons out of her carriage window on the ride home. “Russia cannot continue on this path!” she exclaims, a one-stop line of self-serving earnestness. The Great, like The Favourite, relishes the timeless comedy of bodily messes (the macaroon episode is called “Blood and Vomit”). A splotchy rash which blooms across Catherine’s chest becomes its own punchline; Fanning’s flushes as she errs or storms off feel like characters of their own. The performance draws viewers in; it’s easy to recall your own storms of emotion in watching Catherine traverse disappointment and ambition – even if her naivety is a fiction within an absurd court farce. There’s a similar drive for relatability underscoring Dickinson, Apple TV’s riff on the life of American poet Emily Dickinson, which fills a loose sketch of her biography with half-ironic #feminism one-liners, swearing and a death fantasy starring rapper Wiz Khalifa. The series, developed by Alena Smith, takes some inspiration from the show Drunk History, in which the past becomes sweetly, hilariously companionable through boozy retellings dubbed over celebrity actors. The real Emily Dickinson was an introvert who rarely published in her lifetime; privately, her poetry experimented with form, the better to capture waves in the storm of one’s mind. TV Dickinson manifests that creative radicalism externally, dispensing with the poet’s longstanding public persona – shy, reclusive – in favor of candid, barbed ambition. As played by the excellent Hailee Steinfeld, to varying effect (I didn’t initially love the show, which felt half-baked in parts, but have warmed to it in later episodes), this Dickinson maintains an affair with her brother’s fiancee, calls bullshit on doing chores and manipulates a crush into publishing her poetry. Confronted with a no-girls-allowed rule for science demonstrations at the local college, Emily translates the era’s subtext plainly: “Maybe they’re so scared that if they teach us how the world works we’ll figure out a way how to take over.” It’s a weirdly entertaining send-up of the real societal limitations facing Dickinson, giving real talent and ambition, however unarticulated or thwarted or quiet, room to breathe and flaunt.  Dispensing with the facts entirely can be more evocative of said talent, as demonstrated by Shirley, released on-demand this week in the US (its theatrical run scrapped by Covid), a film which rejects the biopic entirely for a fiction mirroring the work of its protagonist, the mid-century horror writer Shirley Jackson. The film, directed by Josephine Decker and based on the novel by Susan Scarf Merrell, takes real-life inspirations for Jackson’s work – her agoraphobia, her emotionally abusive but co-dependent marriage, her imposing house in Vermont – as material for a psychodrama in which a younger couple staying as guests, and the women’s hold on reality, combusts under the Jackson roof. The film aims not for accuracy but instead to drop the viewer into a Jackson story, which does far more to dig into the truth of her genius, and to honor her work excavating the ghoulish, terrifying depths of women’s insecurities and mental prisons, than any by-the-numbers portrait ever could. Though in an entirely different register than the two comic series, Shirley presents perhaps the best example of liberated fiction’s potential as the most effective female biopic. A life’s recounting bound to “fact” would necessarily focus on constraint, struggle or the negotiation of image and ambition in a man’s world. Instead, Shirley centers the author’s artistic brilliance, Dickinson revels in the poet’s real creative confidence, The Great trickily extricates the contradictions of the Enlightened despot’s position. It’s not fact, per se, but who’s to say that’s not closer to the truth?"
"There have been times in the past week when the news has been so appalling – and when fury and despair have threatened to take over so completely – that I’ve gone scrambling in search of musical solace. Some of what I’ve enjoyed most has been at the distinctly homemade end of the spectrum: LPO double bassist Hugh Kluger’s breathtakingly luminous performance of the Prelude from JS Bach’s Cello Suite No 2, for instance, filmed at home in Australia (available via LPOnline). Or the 15th instalment of the Kanneh-Mason family livestream (via Facebook), in which the wobbly camera, cellist Sheku’s self-conscious introductions and the occasional maternal voice off-camera add to the charm of watching performances from the UK’s most famous musical family. In this episode it’s Rachmaninov’s song The Muse, arranged for cello and piano by Sheku and his pianist sister, Isata, that sticks in the mind: the cello as rich and lyrical as you could wish for, their musical partnership endlessly communicative. Of course, there are innumerable more polished opportunities for musical escapism. I relished Angela Hewitt’s Kings Place performance of Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 22 K482 with Aurora Orchestra conducted by Duncan Ward from December 2019 (available until 17 June) in this vein. The outer movements are stylish, if polite, the orchestra always light on its feet, Hewitt’s phrasing always graceful. The slow middle movement, though, is almost painfully beautiful: momentum gathers from a tentative opening to blossom slowly into warmth as Hewitt enters. This is music-making with an enviable, precious sense of unrestricted space. Best of all is Hewitt’s brief encore – the Gigue from JS Bach’s Partita No 1 – which is mesmerising and limpid: a reminder of her extraordinary command of Bach’s keyboard music. Music’s distractions have rarely felt more necessary. But the stakes remain high – the politics of any musical performance inescapable – no matter how transcendent the sounds. Like so many, I was deeply moved by Stephen Hough’s recital inaugurating the season of special live broadcasts from Wigmore Hall and Radio 3. His Bach-Busoni Chaconne managed to be both monumental and intimate, his Schumann Fantasie impeccably poised, Hough in total control for its duration over time’s onward march. Yet I couldn’t forget hearing Wigmore Hall CEO John Gilhooly on Radio 4’s Front Row only days earlier, describing the new series as “a glimmer of hope” – but insisting that, while the Wigmore might be able to survive financially into next year, “others will go under in the next six to eight weeks”. The danger, then, is that music – and the other performing arts – can be dismissed by those holding the public purse strings as nothing more than a “delightful reprieve”, dispensable at a time of global crisis. Opera North’s 2017 production of Bernstein’s Trouble in Tahiti offers one obvious retort to that view: it’s a claustrophobic opera at the best of times (an unflinching portrait of a marriage on the rocks) and a seriously tough watch under lockdown. A performance this slick, this unbearably true-to-life, offers no escapist pleasure – rather it’s a bracing challenge to face the music.  Flora’s pick for the coming week I still remember the emotional hangover left by Samuel Barber’s Vanessa in Keith Warner’s ultra-stark production at Glyndebourne in 2018 and can’t resist watching it again on operavision.eu (from 14 June). And I’ll also be watching Richard Jones’s staging of Puccini’s Il trittico at Royal Opera House (until 19 June), above all for Ermonela Jaho’s extraordinary debut as Suor Angelica."
"Dame Jocelyn Barrow served on the advisory committee for what was to become the Transatlantic Slavery Gallery: Against Human Dignity at the Merseyside Maritime Museum (MMM) in Liverpool. The project was a longheld ambition of Sir Peter Moores and, having served on the board of governors of the BBC with Jocelyn, he was keen for her to help and advise.  The original research for what had been considered a taboo subject was commissioned by the Peter Moores Foundation and had been kept a well-guarded secret. No location could be found to host what was expected to be such an incendiary project until National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside agreed to make space for the display. It was particularly appropriate for the gallery to be in Liverpool, which not only has one of the oldest black communities in Europe but was also a major slaving port in the 18th century. With Jocelyn very much hands-on, it all came together, and the gallery, opened in 1994 by Maya Angelou, proved a great success. It was later moved to a new area in the MMM, enlarged and with a broader brief, and renamed the International Slavery Museum."
"In his latest Closer Look segment, Seth Meyers addressed sustained protests against anti-black racism and the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last week, and Donald Trump’s authoritarian responses in Washington, which have become so egregious that even his former defense secretary Jim Mattis publicly denounced him. Despite saying upon his resignation last year that he would “not speak ill of a sitting president”, Mattis warned Americans in an article in the Atlantic this week that they “must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution”. In response, the president tweeted: “Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General…His nickname was ‘Chaos,’ which I didn’t like & changed to ‘Mad Dog’.” “OK, first of all, he resigned. You didn’t fire him,” Meyers corrected. “Second, you didn’t come up with the name Mad Dog. He’s had it since at least 2004, and we know you didn’t come up with it because it’s a cool nickname and your nicknames suck … if you had come up with a nickname for him it would’ve been something like Lame James or Jumpin’ Jim.” It’s clear, Meyers continued, that “Trump and the police establishment are obviously threatened by the widespread popularity of the protests, which have been both effective and everywhere.” Protesters have spoken up in all 50 states. “The map is finally all red, but not for the reason that Trump wants,” said Meyers. “This kind of massive, sustained political mobilization represents a direct threat to the unjust system of predatory policing we currently have, which is why the people who benefit from this system are lashing out so aggressively,” Meyers continued. “One after another, we’ve watched countless videos of local police departments arresting or violently attacking peaceful protesters, and reporters lawfully exercising their first amendment rights.” For example, cellphone video captured a Miami police officer shoving a woman with her hands up to the ground; the Miami Herald later found that that officer had been reviewed by police internal affairs for excessive force 79 times in three and a half years on the job. “Seventy-nine times in three and a half years – I haven’t used shampoo that much in the same time period,” said Meyers. “And granted, I probably should’ve, but how many times do you have to get in trouble before you get fired. No other job works like that! If a commercial airline pilot had been investigated 79 times for flying upside down and doing barrel rolls while hammered on Goldschläger, we wouldn’t be like, ‘All right, man, 80 strikes and you’re out!’” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert marveled at the spread of the protests across America, noting that at least 430 cities and towns – from New York to Atlanta to Laramie, Wyoming, and Helena, Montana – have seen demonstrations in support of Black Lives Matter. “These protests are uniting Americans of all backgrounds, because you may have noticed that Boise, Idaho, does not have a lot of black people. Neither does Laramie, Wyoming,” he said.  “Please don’t buy the false narrative that these are lawless mobs,” Colbert added. “The vast majority of these protests have been peaceful. And you might not know that if you watch cable news, because to the news, peace is boring. That’s why CNN just launched their sister network: the Burning Trash Can Channel.” Meanwhile, tensions have been escalated by police enforcing curfews in cities across the nation, from New York to Los Angeles. “The point of a curfew is to stop lawbreakers from taking advantage of protests, but in some cities, protesters are getting swept up by cops in curfews starting as early as 6pm,” Colbert explained, as police use curfew “as an excuse to bring the smackdown on peaceful protesters”. Colbert also touched on Mattis’s public denunciation of Trump, which he called “especially surprising” because Mattis’s parting words were: “I will not speak ill of a sitting president.”  “Evidently, he will speak ill of a president sitting on a bed covered in cold curly fries,” said Colbert. “Protests are continuing nationwide,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, and in Washington, “where law enforcement has taken a much more forceful approach, including teargassing peaceful protesters, things are not as amicable. “Authorities there are busy erecting another fence that will go around the existing White House fence, which will make two fences.“ Kimmel continued. “So it looks like Trump is finally getting his wall built after all. How long before we find out Don Jr invested in a fence company?” Meanwhile, Kimmel dissected Trump’s tweet-response to Mattis’s “one-star Yelp review” which called Trump a threat to the constitution. Trump’s claim that he nicknamed Mattis Mad Dog is an outright lie, given that he has been called that for many years prior to his work in the administration. “What a strange thing to lie about – it’s so easily disproved!”  Finally, a Twitter user experimented with posting Trump’s tweets, verbatim, to see if they would be blocked for inciting violence. They were indeed blocked by the platform, while Trump’s exact same tweets went unmarked. Which made Kimmel wonder if “maybe Twitter has a way of determining who is and isn’t a threat based on how tiny the person who tweeted’s thumbs are”."
"Iain Stirling, voice of Love Island, standup comedian I remember everything in terms of football. It was the day Liverpool played Atlético de Madrid and, as I watched, I felt a bit fluey, meaning I had the symptoms of coronavirus. I had a gig in London the next day and with about five hours to go we cancelled, along with the shows in Brighton and Cardiff. At that point, I thought: “Hopefully I’ll feel better and then we can carry on.” But then Boris Johnson announced lockdown, and I had to postpone the entire spring leg of my tour, plus the recording of my Amazon Prime special.  Luckily, because most of my material isn’t topical, I haven’t had to rip it all up. I tried a few coronavirus jokes back in February, but as soon as I mentioned it the audience went a bit weird. It’s difficult to joke about something when you’re all in the same room, breathing the same air. I don’t know whether people will want to laugh about coronavirus when this is over, or pretend it never happened.  Not doing Love Island this year is a blow. You think because it’s such a big show, they’ll find a way to make it happen. But postponing it is the right thing to do. I’ve spent so many summers in Spain now that it’s going to be weird not to be out there. For the first few weeks of lockdown, my partner Laura [Whitmore, who presents] said she felt like she was in the audience of a gig every time we had dinner. I had to do something with that energy – it was either that or run down the street screaming at couples – so I’ve started doing live streams on Twitch.  I can’t wait to get back on Love Island. Watching all the contestants being introduced is my favourite bit. Do they have funny surnames? Is there a turn of phrase or mannerism I can pick up on? I want to meet the new islanders more than anything. I need more islanders in my life. Laura Wade, dramatist We were just gearing up for the debut of The Watsons in London’s West End when everything shut down. All the cast had been engaged, and we were about to choose understudies. Knowing that these 17 people were expecting to be in work this summer and now aren’t has been the hardest bit. You feel a responsibility. The Watsons, my adaptation of the unfinished novel by Jane Austen, had such a long gestation. I can’t quite believe it’s gone. Maybe I’m in denial, but I do believe it will come back. I’m not sure where or how though. Too much is in the air. I know the show’s producers will do everything they can to get it back up and running.  The best thing about being a playwright is having a play on. We write to communicate, to share our stories. Getting into rehearsals, getting a play on stage, that’s what I live for. So it feels extremely sad right now. But everyone in the industry is in the same boat. It’s not like only my show got cancelled because, say, the finance fell through. You have to be humble about your own disappointment, and see the bigger picture.  I wonder what theatre will be like after coronavirus. Will there still be audiences? What will they want to see? What will be able to afford to give them? I know we are an industry of resourceful and imaginative people. We won’t give up without a big fight. The aliveness of theatre is such a special, specific thing. I can’t see it going away.  Wayne McGregor, choreographer I’ve never had anything cancelled before in my career. Now, thanks to coronavirus, around 80 shows I was involved in around the world have been cancelled.  I’d been working on The Dante Project, a three-part epic that was due to premiere at the Royal Opera House in London this month. It took three years to bring together. The score was done, the designs were finished, and we were just about to go into rehearsals with the Royal Ballet when everything shut down.  The actual cancellation was quite quick and brutal. I found out in March just after my 50th birthday. The Royal Ballet had planned a celebration for me, to go alongside the Dante premiere, which would have been lovely. I’m generally an optimist, though. I’m pretty good at dealing with what life throws at me. The most difficult thing for me has been my company. I have a company of 50 people and they’re my biggest concern. Trying to work out how it can have a life in the future has taken a huge amount of energy.  The creative arts will always be vibrant, but this is a key moment for the government to realise their crucial value to everyday life, and support the industry. The experience of watching a play, a ballet, a live performance, when you’re all in the same space, breathing the same air together – that’s such a special thing.  Catherine Cohen, comedian and actor In early March, I did this fun show in Washington DC with a bunch of female comedians. After the show, I asked them: “I’m meant to go to London in two days. Do you think that’s a bad idea?” And they were like: “No, it will be fine. You should go!” So I flew to London and there were six people on my flight. There was this weird energy in the air, but my show was sold out and went amazingly. Afterwards, I was hugging a bunch of people and having drinks at the bar. I got back to my hotel room at 3am and finally had a chance to check my phone. There was a message from my mum saying: “You need to come home right now!” I cancelled the rest of my London shows and flew back. I’m dying to get back to performing. I host a weekly show at Club Cumming in New York’s East Village and I miss it so much. I’ve started hosting it every Wednesday on my Instagram Live, which is useful, because having a show to prepare for helps me remember what day of the week it is. But it’s no replacement for the energy of performing in front of a live crowd. My mood changes on the hour. Some days I wake up with a knot in my stomach, feeling hopeless, thinking that everything I’ve ever worked for in my career has disappeared. And then other days I think: “What a wonderful opportunity to pause, reflect – and reinvent my artistic process!” Jack Bevan, drummer, Foals We were at Heathrow airport, on our way to tour Asia, just as everything started to shut down. When we arrived at Manila, in the Philippines, everyone at the airport was having their temperature checked. Then our Manila gig got cancelled the day before we were meant to play. We flew back to the UK and were in lockdown about a week later.  I feel sorry for emerging bands who would have been promoting debut records this summer. They’ll be hit the hardest. If coronavirus had happened to us the year our first album came out, or even our second, it would have crippled us. We might have been dropped by our label. But because we’re more established, we’ve been able to take a year off touring. Still, it hurts. Festivals account for approximately 80% of our income. The impact on artists is huge, but it’s also devastating for people who aren’t talked about so much – the road crew and the venue staff, who may not fall into the furloughing scheme. We’ve been selling fans Foals T-shirts to support the crew. We’ve actually sold 3,000, which helped tide them over for a few months.  We haven’t been able to get in a room to play because of the lockdown rules – and I’m itching to do it. This is the longest I’ve gone without playing the drums since I was 14. Our initial plan was to spend 2020 touring, then and go back into the studio next year. But I think we’ll probably start writing later this year instead, and get back to touring next year — if we’re allowed.  Chelsea Wolfe, singer-songwriter It was wild watching everything happen. I went from being on a tour bus on my way to Berlin to buying flights, driving straight to the airport, and getting on a chaotic plane home to the US. My crew and I almost didn’t make it back. After Trump announced a ban on all arrivals from Europe, the airlines started price-gouging. Flights were jumping from a few hundred dollars to thousands right in front of our eyes.  There was definitely a period of mourning when I got home. I poured so much into Birth of Violence, my last album, and I was so looking forward to getting it out to people on tour. I thought I might still be able to do my later tour dates, but then the entire European leg was cancelled, followed by Australia and New Zealand. I live in northern California, near the mountains. Now I wake up in the morning, do a Zoom yoga class, and start making music in my home studio. Once I got over the shock of being at home, it was nice to be creative again. I work on songs with my bandmates, going back and forth via email.  The financial stuff is scary. Cancelling the tour was huge. I’d already invested so much money into booking the tour bus, renting the gear, paying for my crew, the flights, a week of their time for rehearsals, the stage dressings. None of that stuff is refundable. I’ve been able to sell some tour merch, which helps. It’s been cool to see fans wanting to support artists. Lots have left comments online saying: “I was meant to see you play live, but I bought a T-shirt instead.”"
"The country is on fire. The islands are beneath the ocean. The government has stopped the boats. There is a global virus that selects its victims across racial lines. The authorities are kidnapping refugees in the summer night. The police are assaulting a door-to-door salesman because his skin is two shades too dark. Eighteen months ago I was asked to develop an anthology which imagined Australia in the year 2050. Originally conceived by the executive director of Diversity Arts Australia, Lena Nahlous, this book would bring together Indigenous writers and writers of colour from every state and territory in Australia to create a collection of short stories and poems in the increasingly popular literary form called “speculative fiction”. In the aftermath of the Black Summer bushfires and amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the Black Lives Matter protests, who among us could ever have speculated that by the time this publication was complete, it would look more like a picture of our current reality, rather than our inevitable future.  As a starting point for this article, I was presented with a simple question: “What happens when 12 diverse writers are asked to imagine Australia in 2050?” The answer hit me while I was breaking my fast on a halal Big Mac during the holy month of Ramadan. What happens? They do the one thing that creatives of colour do best: they don’t listen.  As the editor, I envisioned a book that would imagine a world after empires, after colonies and after white supremacy. So I called it After Australia. However, the writer of Martu ancestry, Karen Wyld sent me a story which intertwined three historical timelines, disentangling the complexity of contemporary Indigenous identity. Award-winning author of The Permanent Resident, Roanna Gonsalves, wrote a love letter to the printing press, which examined the governor’s order in 1814.  I wondered if I needed to inform these writers that their contributions did not align with the intended vision of the project, which was to imagine Australia’s future. But then, while searching through the bookshelves at Bankstown Library for an apocalyptic statement by some famous author to include in the book as an epigraph, I stumbled upon a quote by the black civil rights leader Malcolm X: All at once it occurred to me that Australia’s future could only be written on the foundations of our past and present. From the groundwork laid out by writers such as Karen and Roanna, the author of No Country Woman, Zoya Patel details a dystopian (not-too-distant-and-kind-of-already-here) future where bushfires have ravaged the ACT and our neighbouring islands have drowned. As the brown people are trying to get in throughout Zoya’s story, in screenwriter Michelle Law’s story, the brown people are trying to get out, while under the occupation of a fascist society that makes 1984 look like The Little Mermaid. Meanwhile, Noongar author of The Old Lie, Claire G Coleman, introduces us to the Ostraka Law of 2039. Her story subverts the notions of systemic institutions and explores both the physical and psychological prisons that manifest in a racialised society. Newcomer Sarah Ross rewrites her experiences as the child of an interracial same-sex couple amid the rubble of the Taj Mahal. Emerging poet Kaya Ortiz plays out our future as a lyrical exercise in multiple choice. Multi-award-winning author and illustrator Ambelin Kwaymullina sends Australia 2020 a dire message from the Ngurra Palya of 2050, and writer and cultural critic, Khalid Warsame depicts an environment that will likely feel the most mundane and safe among all the stories in After Australia, until, you realise it isn’t. Perhaps the most controversial contribution in After Australia is written by the poet and essayist, Omar J. Sakr. In his short story, White Flu, he dissects the vivid texture of multicultural suburbia against a global pandemic that will be frighteningly familiar to readers at this moment in time, only this particular virus seems to have selected “white” people as its primary casualty. On the day that the news about the coronavirus first broke out, approximately three months after Omar had completed White Flu, he sent me a text message:  F***** strewth, fair dunkum, the flu is coming tru! However, as many may gasp at Sakr’s prophecy, the most fascinating aspect of White Flu is not the global pandemic in the background, but the narrative that takes place in the foreground: an Arab-Australian Muslim man from western Sydney is having an affair with his male cousin. Sakr is one of Australia’s few artists who knows how to strike at both ends of the culturally-conservative spectrum: Arabs and Muslims won’t care that the protagonist is sleeping with his cousin, but they’ll be shocked that he is gay, and white people won’t care that the protagonist is gay, but they’ll be disgusted that he’s sleeping with his cousin.  In an equally prophetic story, a playwright and author originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Future Destiny Fidel, lays bare the tragic future and destiny of so many young men whose only crime is that they are born with black skin. Future’s story, Your Skin is the Only Cloth You Cannot Wash, recounts an incident in which he was going from door-to-door selling solar panels to the residents of Mount Ommaney, Brisbane. Suddenly he was confronted and arrested by a group of white police officers after a complaint from a concerned citizen about a strange black man wandering the neighbourhood. Future’s story arrives in a present where protests throughout the United States have erupted after the killing of George Floyd under the knee of a white police officer. This incident was straight off the heels of another “lynching” of an innocent African American male from Georgia, named Ahmaud Arbery, who was violently gunned down by two white vigilantes who claimed he looked like a man suspected in several break-ins in their area.  As Australians attempt to seize this moment and expose our own history of systemic and structural racism, particularly towards Indigenous communities, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had some advice for us: ‘We don’t need to draw equivalence here.” You’re a few hundred years too late, Morrison. We’re not speculating – this shit’s happening.  In a country where Indigenous people are regularly assaulted by police; where young African men are demonised as “gangsters” by our news media and politicians; where Pacific Islanders are overrepresented in our prisons; where Muslims cannot conduct their Friday prayers without wondering if an Australian-born white supremacist is lurking outside with a machine gun; and where we cannot go into self-isolation without blaming four-and-a-half billion Asians – solidarity between Australia’s minorities is central to our survival. By far the most unique aspect of After Australia is the way in which all the stories and poems converge into a unified voice speaking for our past, present and future as a whole. Wiradjuri writer Hannah Donnelly guides us on this journey with her collection of stories, Black Thoughts. In spite of the challenges we face as a nation, Hannah’s words remind us that there is hope as the world continues to unravel: “Our time is a loop. We’ll find our way back, before, after...” After Australia, $24.99, is edited by Michael Mohammed Ahmad and published by Affirm Press in partnership with Diversity Arts Australia and Sweatshop Literacy Movement"
"On Wednesday’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert opened with news that Minnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, had elevated charges against police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with killing George Floyd last week by kneeling on his neck for over eight minutes. Ellison elevated Chauvin’s charges to second-degree murder and added charges of aiding and abetting murder to the other three officers on the scene. “So, activism works. Justice is possible – easy, peasy, hold protests for nine days straight in 80 American cities squeezy,” said Colbert. Meanwhile, Trump’s recent conduct recalled for Colbert the night he was elected, when the host was “somewhat emotional” because “what I was worried about deep down is that Trump is a dictator fanboy. He is a lifetime subscriber to ‘Tiger Beat down the protesters’. And now we’re teetering dangerously close to Trump making his dreams our nightmare.” Colbert referred to Trump’s “fascist photo op” on Monday, when he ordered non-violent protesters removed from the area in front of St John’s church in DC with flash grenades and teargas so Trump could take a picture holding a Bible. “It was like a little Tiananmen Square, or in Trump’s case, Tiny Man Square,” said Colbert. Trump reportedly “went medieval on the protesters in part because he was upset – humiliated, really – about the TV people revealing that he hid in a bunker over the weekend”, reports which Trump attempted to dismiss of Fox News radio as “false” because he was there for a “tiny, little, short period of time … for an inspection”. “That is an all-time great excuse,” said Colbert. “So he was just checking to make sure the bunker was OK – ‘I didn’t poop my pants, I just ran diagnostics on my boxers to see if they were load-bearing. They are.” Even worse, Trump’s pap walk to the photo op was accompanied by the secretary of defense, Mark Esper, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milly. “One of the hallmarks of American democracy is the US armed forces’ proud tradition of remaining out of politics to emphasize civilian control of the military, yet on the way to the photo-op – that was, yet again, preceded by attacking peaceful protesters – Esper and Milly walked with Trump across the street,” Colbert explained. “It reminds me of the old joke: why did the defense secretary and the chairman of the joint chiefs cross the road? Because the president is a chicken.” On Wednesday, Esper defended the farcical promenade by telling reporters: “I didn’t know where I was going.” Colbert would have none of it: “You’re the secretary of defense, and your defense is that you didn’t know where you were going? The rest of us could see exactly where you were going.” Colbert also lamented displays of unnecessary force by police across the country, such as those dressed in riot gear on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and large, armored military vehicles driven down the streets of the capital. “Secretary Esper, do you see where we’re going now?” Colbert said of the vehicles. “It’s so close you don’t need a ride – you could walk. Although, really, more of a goosestep.” “The whole world has been watching and weighing in,” said Jimmy Kimmel of the nine days of nationwide protests against anti-black racism and police brutality in America. Even China’s government released a statement saying it hoped America would “take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination”. “And when China is giving you a lecture on human rights – not a great sign,” said Kimmel. Kimmel also lambasted Trump’s Bible photo op from Monday, which White House press secretary and “business suit Barbie” Kayleigh McEnany insisted on Wednesday was not a photo op despite basically telling reporters it was a photo op. “Let’s review the facts here,” said Kimmel. “He walked to the church. He stood in front of the church. He never went in the church. Never spoke to anyone from the church, didn’t examine the damage to the church, held a Bible upside down, didn’t read from the Bible, didn’t give a speech, posed for photos and left.  “I don’t know, that sounds like a pretty textbook definition of a photo op to me. He treated it like taking your kid to see Santa at the mall.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon recapped Trump’s abysmal poll numbers, which put disapproval of his performance at 54%, the highest recorded for any president at this point in his first term. “Right now, Trump seems to be polling somewhere between Jake Paul and that time I decided to grow a mustache for the summer,” Fallon joked. “When Trump saw his numbers, he started crying and then was like, ‘I’m not crying, it’s the teargas from my church photoshoot blowing back in my face.’ “That’s right, everyone seems to be turning on him – to give you an example, Fox & Friends is now just Fox and Friend,” he continued. “At this point, Trump should just go for 100% disapproval and then take credit for uniting the country.” As for the Bible photo op, Fallon had some questions on Trump’s form: “How does Trump not know how to hold a book?” he wondered, playing footage of Trump waving the Bible with his “broken GI Joe hand … it’s like he’s plucking the Bible from the Bible tree.”"
"Charlotte Higgins is right to stress real opportunities for the arts when the present crisis recedes (After the war, the arts came back stronger. They can do so again now, 18 May). Large arts venues like the Royal Albert Hall must be saved from collapse; their easily reusable spaces are ideal for small-scale performances of music, theatre, dance, all possible with physical distancing of performers and audience. Informal lunchtime concerts, free rehearsals, experimental work, “rewritten” classics (Sophocles, Shakespeare, Chekhov), Beethoven symphonies scored for chamber forces, “grand opera” with two singers and a piano – the opportunities for breaking down elitist barriers are limitless, with huge benefits to artists and audiences. All it takes is money. A massive government loan, interest-free, would surely be repaid in time by a newly energised arts world, reaching out to new audiences as well as loyal enthusiasts.Judith ChernaikDirector, Poems on the Underground  Charlotte Higgins presents an updated version of the classic case for the arts. But with a Conservative government, let’s not forget the income they generate for the exchequer and for businesses such as hotels and restaurants.Mark WoolgarGuildford, Surrey  Would it not be possible for the Arts Council to launch an appeal directed at theatre- and concert-goers who are currently saving a great deal of money by not going out? To respond with a donation or direct debit would not be altruistic but self-interested, since all arts lovers want to see a thriving culture return. The Octagon or Wigmore Hall are not likely to be high on the government’s priority list.James WatsonLondon  The economic case for emergency government support for the arts is unimpeachable, given ample research that every £1 invested in the arts returns at least four times that to the wider economy. But any support should go first to small regional theatre companies rather than places like the National Theatre (National Theatre may shed 30% of its staff without more support, 21 May). High-profile London-based institutions will always be able to attract significant corporate donations. Much smaller companies will fold soon for the lack of money that would be chickenfeed to the NT.Norman MillerBrighton  As Antonia Fraser points out (Letters, 18 May), during the war cultural organisations did not grind entirely to a halt. Sadler’s Wells and the Old Vic were transferred to Burnley, producing the opera Hansel and Gretel and Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Burnley Empire Theatre, Grade II listed, was built in 1894, but has lain empty since 1995. The Burnley Empire Trust plans to restore it with the support of the National Heritage Lottery Fund, the National Trust and Burnley borough council.Stephen WardArnside, Cumbria"
"I seem to have been absent-mindedly staring at the patch just above the TV for a few weeks now. The apparently compelling space where the paint isn’t even in the process of drying has been occupying most of my attention, while sounds and moving shapes – some louder and brighter than others – emit from the large shiny rectangle beneath, occasionally interrupted by an inquiry asking whether I’m still watching. And my answer is yes … sort of. It’s been hard to concentrate on the truly challenging stuff, and by “challenging”, I mean anything with more than one very straight-lined plot, or something that deviates from the kind of show where I can still tell what’s going on even after I’ve zoned out for a few moments, having been distracted by dropping half a tea-soaked digestive down my front. As much as I usually feel the need to shower after watching Saturday night ITV (a useful prompt at the moment, frankly), I’m suddenly finding Ninja Warrior UK strangely watchable. It could be the combination of swimming pools, baying crowds standing close to each other, and a commentary insinuating that any of this actually matters. More worryingly, however, it could be that I miss those guys at the gym more than I thought – the ones who gurn, say “bro” with a straight face, and pose in the mirror with their phones. Either way, this is an easy watch, especially with a glass of wine, a bowl of crisps, looking at these ripped desperados, and asking yourself, “Who’s really winning?” (It’s them.) It’s the easy telly, or things I have seen before – bringing me back to the relative comfort of my youth, or the relative comfort of, y’know, around three months ago. Shortly before lockdown, I had spied old Channel 4 hangover favourite The OC lurking on Amazon Prime, under the category, and I shit you not, “Could this BE more nostalgic?’” In due time, I managed to get past this initial hurdle, and the sun-kissed melodramas of Seth (more annoying than I remember), Ryan – who appears to wear a choker for the first season to let you know he’s from the WrongSideOfTheTracks™; Marissa (much more annoying than I remember) and Sandy Cohen’s eyebrows have returned me to a simpler time of the Killers being cutting edge and Original Penguin clothing not being something Tim Lovejoy wears. This level of comfort is only otherwise reserved for watching clips of The Big Breakfast on YouTube. There’s an especially pleasing one of Chris Evans getting hit square in the face by a snowball and storming off, but reliving Get Your Nobbly Nuts Out, and Zig and Zag in the bathroom gives me the kind of Proustian rush that not even Sandy Cohen’s eyebrows can equal. If I find myself missing actual relationships and need to be reminded that human interaction is not all it’s cracked up to be, then Judd Apatow’s Love on Netflix does the job. The deeply flawed protagonists prompt me to wince, recoil and grimace my way through three seasons of very watchable episodes, making me happy that the new normal will no longer require me to build the kind of life that adults built in the beforetimes (career, relationship, hope, etc). Instead, I can breathe a sigh of relief, happily snuffing it at my laptop way beyond current retirement age, in the middle of typing my 20th “just following up” of the day, while watching Johnny Vaughan dressed as a vicar. An honourable mention goes to what, aside from watching Boris Johnson murder oratory in front of an entire nation, is the only linear TV I’ve watched this entire time. Antiviral Wipe summed up the last few months in a more astute, objective and funny way than any news programme or talking head has managed so far. Please do another one, otherwise I’m going to have to start re-watching Dawson’s Creek."

"Without a doubt, An Audience With Billy Connolly. The “incontinence pants” routine is such a brilliant piece of physical comedy. Friends. I love it so much. It is so wonderfully written and the gag rate is phenomenal. The writing team would work on the basis of finding multiple punchlines for each joke and it shows.  Really tough one as I have so many. Probably Blazing Saddles. So quotable, so politically incorrect yet so funny. There is a photo of me where I am wearing Bermuda shorts that have a werewolf on them with bright green sunglasses on saying “radical”. Absolutely tragic. A couple of years back I had a go at making French onion soup. I got my measurements and consistencies all wrong so it resulted in a watery, grey mess. It was so salty you could float in it. It was abysmal. I have had some shocking hairstyles, from trying to look like Noel Gallagher in the mid-90s to badly dyeing it bleach blond. The worst was when I cut my own hair with clippers and forgot to put the guard on: I shaved a huge divot into the side of my head, panicked and tried to stick the hair back on.  People being prank scared. The Japanese do it the best. There is a wonderful video where a guy enters a lift with a box of snakes and then when the doors close he drops it. The panic of everyone else in the lift is hilarious. What’s ET short for? He’s got wee legs. Mark Nelson hosts Live at the Stand Comedy Club, livestreamed every Saturday, thestand.co.uk"
"The historian and broadcaster David Starkey has apologised for claiming that slavery was not genocide because of the survival of “so many damn blacks”. Starkey who made the comment on the rightwing broadcaster Darren Grimes’s online show on Thursday, said that he was “very sorry” for being “deplorably inflammatory”. The former chancellor Sajid Javid and the historian David Olusoga were among those who criticised Starkey after he told Grimes while discussing the Black Lives Matter movement: “Slavery was not genocide, otherwise there wouldn’t be so many damn blacks in Africa or in Britain would there? You know, an awful lot of them survived.” The next day, HarperCollins UK said it would not be publishing any further books by Starkey and he resigned from his honorary fellowship at Fitzwilliam College at Cambridge amid pressure on the college to cut ties with him. Canterbury Christ Church University also terminated Starkey’s role as visiting professor. On Monday, talking about his use of the phrase “so many damn blacks”, Starkey said: “It was intended to emphasise, in hindsight with awful clumsiness, the numbers who survived the horrors of the slave trade. Instead, it came across as a term of racial abuse. “This, in the present atmosphere, where passions are high and feelings raw, was deplorably inflammatory. It was a bad mistake. “I am very sorry for it and I apologise unreservedly for the offence it caused. “I have also paid a heavy price for one offensive word, with the loss of every distinction and honour acquired in a long career.” As well as lamenting the impact on his career, Starkey also claimed that if free speech “is suppressed on questions of race, resentments will fester rather than disappear. My principal regret is that my blundering use of language and the penalty it has incurred will further restrict the opportunities for proper debate.” The historian said the “misunderstanding of my words in no way reflects my views or practice on race”. However, it is not the first time he has been accused of racism. Appearing on BBC Newsnight after the summer riots of 2011, Starkey said: “A substantial amount of the chavs have become black. The whites have become black; a particular sort of violent destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion.” He also gave an interview to the Telegraph in which he said statistics “appeared” to show a black propensity to violence."

"HarperCollins has dropped David Starkey as an author, saying that the racist views the bestselling historian expressed in a recent interview were “abhorrent”. On Thursday, Starkey told the rightwing commentator Darren Grimes that “slavery was not genocide, otherwise there wouldn’t be so many damn blacks in Africa or in Britain would there? You know, an awful lot of them survived.” Following widespread condemnation – former chancellor Sajid Javid described the comments as racist and “a reminder of the appalling views that still exist” in Britain, while the historian David Olusoga said they were “truly disgusting” – HarperCollins UK said it would not be publishing any further books by Starkey. “The views expressed by David Starkey in his recent interview are abhorrent and we unreservedly condemn them,” said the publisher. “Our last book with the author was in 2010, and we will not be publishing further books with him. We are reviewing his existing backlist in light of his comments and views.” Starkey was signed by HarperCollins in a four-book deal in 2006, publishing titles including Monarchy: Behind the Royal Mask from the Tudors to the Present, and Henry: Virtuous Prince, the first in a planned two-part biography of Henry VIII. It is understood that the other two titles in the deal, which included the second part of Starkey’s biography, will no longer be published by HarperCollins. The book is currently listed online as coming out in September. A spokesperson for Hodder & Stoughton, which published Starkey’s 2015 book Magna Carta, said it would also not publish him again: “We unequivocally condemn racism in any form. We published a book by David Starkey in 2015 as a one off project to mark the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta to coincide with a TV documentary. We will not be publishing any further books by him.” On Friday, Starkey also resigned from his honorary fellowship at Fitzwilliam College at Cambridge. A statement from the college said: “The Master has accepted Dr David Starkey’s resignation of his honorary fellowship with immediate effect. “Fitzwilliam prides itself in leading the way in Cambridge in opening access to higher education for under-represented groups. Our student and academic bodies are diverse and welcoming to all. We do not tolerate racism.” They added: “Honorary fellows have the same responsibility as all members of our college to uphold our values.” Canterbury Christ Church University also terminated Starkey’s role as visiting professor, saying his comments were “completely unacceptable”. Prof Rama Thirunamachandran, vice-chancellor of Canterbury Christ Church University, apologised to staff and students at the university in Kent who have been offended and upset by the “appalling” comments. He said: “Widely reported comments by historian David Starkey during a recent online interview are, in our view, completely unacceptable and do not reflect the values of our university and community.” This is not the first time Starkey has been criticised for his remarks on race. Following the summer riots in 2011, he told BBC Newsnight that “a substantial amount of the chavs have become black. The whites have become black; a particular sort of violent destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion.”"
"After weeks of sustained protests against anti-black racism and police brutality across America, Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to curb police violence. But “before you get excited … don’t,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show, as the order “doesn’t do much”. For example, the order promises federal grants to departments for training and certification courses. “I’m pretty sure the chant is ‘defund the police’,” said Colbert. “If you give them more funding, they’re just going to spend it on a tank called the De-Escalator 4000.” Trump also promised to ban police use of chokeholds except “if an officer’s life is at risk”, which is, as Colbert noted, “a loophole big enough to drive a squad car through”. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign continues to plan for its rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, this weekend, despite the public health risk of coronavirus and an editorial from the Tulsa World declaring “this is the wrong time and Tulsa is the wrong place for the Trump rally.” Well, “You know what they say: two wrongs make a rallyful of whites,” Colbert said. Faced with public scrutiny over the risks of crowding thousands of people together indoors during a pandemic, the campaign has promised to have hand sanitizer and face masks on hand, though they won’t be required. “Then they’re not going to wear them!” Colbert said. “Just like Trump doesn’t wear them, which puts Trump in danger, too. The president of the United States is going to be exposed to the aerosolized spittle of 19,000 people. Honest to God, how does the Secret Service allow him to do that?” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah examined Trump’s executive order, a “confusing” measure in that it discourages police use of chokeholds unless an officer felt his life was threatened, “which means the thing can be used, but it can’t be used … but it can be used”, said Noah. Noah also noted that Trump’s “heart wasn’t in” his announcement of the order, in which he constantly praised the police. “The only paper Trump has signed with less enthusiasm were his first two marriage certificates,” Noah said. Trump once again downplayed the use of excessive force by police to a “tiny” number of officers, “but, I mean, if bad cops were a minor problem, you wouldn’t have huge protests in every city,” Noah countered. “You’d just be able to point at the bad cop and be like ‘hey, Gary! Cut that shit out!’” While Trump’s executive order “clearly doesn’t have much teeth”, said Noah, some cities are taking concrete, immediate action – this week, the New York police department disbanded the 600-member plainclothes undercover unit, notorious for its excessive and discriminatory use of force, and San Francisco and Albuquerque city councils said 911 calls for situations such as drug overdoses and mental health emergencies will result in trained professionals instead of armed police. “I think we can all agree: this is long overdue in America,” Noah said of the reforms. “Police in America do too much. So if you can avoid bringing armed police to these situations in the first place, that should be the goal. Because wherever a gun is present, that means that there’s a chance the gun is going to go off. “I know this seems like a radical idea to some people,” Noah concluded of sending in unarmed police to most calls. “But if you think about it, it’s the same thing we did with Ghostbusters over 30 years ago. They used to send cops out when the ghosts showed up, and at some point they realized that the cops were not the right people to deal with the ghost issue, so they created the Ghostbusters. They didn’t have guns, they had ghost vacuum cleaners – it worked way better, and it was also funnier.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel discussed an upcoming tell-all book from the former national security adviser John Bolton, AKA “the guy who offered to testify during the impeachment trial, but the Republicans said: nah, no thanks, we’re good”. “I’ll be honest, I’ve almost forgotten about the impeachment trial,” said Kimmel. “At this point it feels like a Hulu show I was really into and then hated the ending of.” Bolton’s book is called The Room Where It Happened, a reference to the musical Hamilton, “which is kinda weird – it’s like if Woodward and Bernstein called their book Nixon Christ Superstar”. The book will supposedly expose misconduct by Trump beyond his quid pro quo phone call with Ukraine, “and while many think the president should be worried, the president thinks John Bolton should be worried”, said Kimmel. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that conversations with him were “highly classified information” and that he hoped the book’s publication brought “criminal problems” for Bolton – made-up standards that were “rules for a bachelor party, not the law”."
"Jimmy Barnes, Tina Arena, Archie Roach, Michael Gudinski, Peter Garrett, Jessica Mauboy, Savage Garden and John Farnham are among more than 1,000 artists, venues, festivals and music industry professionals who have signed an open letter urging for an immediate federal government rescue package for the music sector. The Australian music industry “fell off a cliff” when government-mandated shutdowns began on 13 March, said the open letter, which was coordinated by copyright collecting agency and music advocacy body APRA/AMCOS. Other signatories included Julia Jacklin, Reg Mombassa, Tex Perkins, Kate Miller-Heidke, Lindy Morrison and Thelma Plum. “From the smallest music venues and festivals in cities, suburbs and towns to the major concerts and events, the Australian music industry is an intricate and complex breeding ground for some of the most acclaimed live talent at home and around the world,” the letter said. “While much of the economy starts to reopen, the ongoing restrictions on large gatherings means our industry will continue to be held back from returning to work. Without immediate government intervention, the Australian music sector will be hit twice as hard as the rest of the economy and thousands of jobs will be lost within months.” The industry is calling for a suite of federal measures, including an extension of the jobkeeper program beyond September, and its expansion to gig and contract workers who would otherwise not qualify; a $40m package for music industry recovery; a boost to Australia Council funding with $70m available across art forms; and tax reform for the live performance and recording sector. The demands are part of a broader proposal by Live Performance Australia for a $345m live performance industry recovery package to see the sector through the next 12 months. The proposal includes funding for theatre, festivals, regional venues and touring as well as live music. A day earlier, a coalition of Melbourne music venues launched a petition with more than 12,000 signatures calling on the Victorian government to save live music in the state from “the brink of collapse” due to the Covid-19 shutdowns. Signatories to Melbourne venues’ Save Our Scene petition express similar concerns about the industry’s ability to recover without targeted government intervention. “Live music means mass gatherings, so it will be many months before our state’s music venues can safely reopen our doors at viable capacities. In the meantime, our venues are being crippled by mounting debt including rent, mortgage payments, bills and insurance. Without government intervention, many of the venues you love will be forced to close their doors permanently,” the petition said. The moves are part of a sustained campaign for greater support for the arts and entertainment sectors, which were one of the first to suffer the economic shock of the nationwide coronavirus shutdowns, and are expected to be hamstrung for at least as long as social distancing regulations are in force. The music industry is not alone in calling for greater support for the sector. The National Association for the Visual Arts has called for a $500m recovery fund “accessible to all arts and cultural organisations across all artforms and at all scales”, an extension of jobseeker and jobkeeper, and the doubling of Australia Council grants funding. The federal arts minister, Paul Fletcher, has defended the eligibility criteria for jobkeeper and jobseeker payments, despite them being consistently criticised by the arts and entertainment sector as inadequate for those members of its workforce in precarious employment. In an article for the Australian newspaper on Tuesday, Fletcher said there was “no basis for the urban myth that somehow the arts sector has been dudded by jobkeeper”. The federal government has also blocked attempts by the states to extend and broaden the jobkeeper subsidy. A spokesperson for Fletcher told Guardian Australia last week that the government was “looking closely at a range of sectors – including the arts and entertainment and screen sectors – which might need longer term support”."
"Sydney Theatre Company’s board has addressed concerns about the company’s viability before the release of its 2019 annual report, which shows an operating loss of $7.75m and warns about its future financial position. Auditors from KPMG assessing STC’s financial statements said there was “material uncertainty” that “may cast significant doubt” on the company’s ability to continue. STC’s chair, the former Commonwealth Bank chief executive Ian Narev, said in his report that the company had embarked upon a plan to secure its future “with external advice under the Safe Harbour provisions of company law”, which allow companies to continue trading while insolvent. STC’s executive director, Patrick McIntyre, told Guardian Australia: “We’re not insolvent at the moment but, with all the revenue switched off, it’s reasonable to assume we could face some insolvency issue this calendar year. “It depends on how long the crisis goes for. I think we’re all in serious threat of going under. I think we’re a big fat canary in the coalmine.” McIntyre said the company had done everything it could to reduce costs, focused on lobbying federal and state governments for further arts relief, and worked with industry bodies to develop a plan to get back on stage. But the uncertainty was real. “Reserves have been depleted and the appetite for risk is very low – we don’t know when we’re reopening and we don’t know how audiences will respond to us reopening,” he said. “We believe that it’s in the best interest of all our stakeholders for the company to survive. That’s what the board is really focused on doing.” STC have cancelled six productions so far and reviewed staffing levels, with most permanent staff working reduced hours. Casual and contract staff employed on a show-by-show basis have lost their jobs. The company’s board of directors prepared cash-flow forecasts for 12 months based on six weeks leading up to 30 April and expectations for the months ahead. Those forecasts formed the basis of its assessment that the company was a going concern. The forecasts, however, assumed that plays would go ahead from September, and that the 2021 season would go ahead as planned. The projections also rely upon the New South Wales government being “favourably disposed” to give further financial assistance to the company, and that costs for its rebuilding project would not blow out. McIntyre said STC was “still waiting on clarity” from state and federal governments about how much assistance they would provide. “The state government has a process and they will arrive at a number and we will then configure our plans and adjust accordingly,” he said. Between 10% and 12% of STC’s revenue comes from government grants. In 2019 this amounted to $3.44m of a total $34.5m. Like most major performing arts companies in Australia, STC reports on the calendar year to align with production seasons. The company has been reporting steadily increasing losses from its core operations (the basic business of putting on theatre, before fundraising and grant revenue has been taken into account) for the past five years, from a deficit of $6.7m in 2015 to $13.3m in 2018. These have been only partially offset by revenue from government grants and philanthropy. McIntyre said the company would look at re-evaluating the size and scope of its productions when it moves back into its Wharf premises at the end of 2020 – something he maintains it is on track to do. The company vacated its premises on Pier 4/5 in the Walsh Bay arts precinct in June 2018 to make way for capital works. McIntyre said the goal of a September reopening didn’t feel “unachievable”. “The unsettling thing at the moment is we can’t have certainty on that,” he said. “We are obviously watching Victoria very carefully and considering what would happen if that were to happen in NSW as well.”"
"This was a week with some indulgently heady stuff, beginning with Szymanowski’s opera Król Roger and followed by Schoenberg’s Gurrelieder. Each deals with kings in crisis, soul-searching in their own way, in highly charged but often ecstatically beautiful music. In the radio broadcast of Royal Opera House’s 2014 production, Polish baritone Mariusz Kwiecień was a fine King Roger in a signature role for him. This king is tipped into crisis by his encounter with a crazed Dionysian figure who arrives in the guise of a shepherd and to whose seductive, hedonistic sway Roger loses his queen, Roxana. As Roger, in isolation, is gradually able to see the light and discover the potency of self-determination, the listener is drawn deeper and deeper into Szymanowski’s radiantly luxuriant score. I hadn’t even planned to listen, but found I couldn’t turn it off. Giving Schoenberg’s massive cantata the operatic treatment was a daring first for Dutch National Opera, the inspired idea of conductor Marc Albrecht, strikingly realised by director Pierre Audi. The medieval legend of King Waldemar, his love for mistress Tove and the cruelty of his murderous queen is told in a sequence of poems by Jens Peter Jacobsen: the setting of Gurre castle is atmospheric, some of the characterisation challenging, yet far from illogical. Jacobsen was a botanist who translated Darwin’s On the Origin of Species into Danish, so nature’s redemptive power is implicit in the words, as is the passion. If the mere mention of Schoenberg is a frightener, think again. This is luscious late romanticism, albeit with glimpses of the composer’s future path. Embedded in the words of Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde – translated from ancient Chinese poems – is the consoling certainty that, while man is mortal, the Earth and its song live on for ever. Today as man and climate change undermine that certainty, the music’s expressive power carries a further poignant force. In the ROH’s second livestreamed concert on 20 June (£4.99 to watch on demand), conducted by Antonio Pappano, the song-symphony was performed in the arrangement for chamber orchestra conceived in detail by Schoenberg and later completed by Rainer Riehn. The obvious version to use in the context of distancing, it highlighted the intimate relationship of the solo voices – tenor David Butt Philip and mezzo Sarah Connolly – with the instrumental soloists, all emerging with clarity and eloquently communicated. Connolly in particular sang from the heart. Compare and contrast this with Mahler’s original mega-score in Simon Rattle’s performance with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from Aldeburgh in 2011, which can be heard on Radio 3 on Tuesday evening (and then on BBC Sounds for 30 days). For those wistful about the absence of this year’s Aldeburgh festival, these repeats are timely, with Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream and an excellent cast marking the summer solstice. But his Peter Grimes staged out in the open on the North Sea shoreline will surely go down as one of the festival’s all-time memorable events. Seeing again the televised recording, with Alan Oke as Grimes, one could smell the salt tang, feel the rising wind and shiver. Under huge pressure to adapt to the present norm, podcasts are one way for organisations to sustain a profile. Welsh National Opera has launched a series – in English and in Welsh – and Longborough festival opera likewise. Theirs opens with Paul Carey Jones who would have been the much-anticipated Wotan in Die Walküre talking with conductor Anthony Negus; in another, LFO artistic director Polly Graham and David Pountney discuss comedy in Wagner. “What larks, Poll, what larks!” But it’s the Guildhall School of Music and Drama who hold all the aces in creating digital performances of their end-of-year opera double-bill. Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas is paired with La bella dormente nel bosco in a rare outing for Respighi’s witty take on the Sleeping Beauty fairytale. It’s the virtual thing in both senses and promises to be both inventive and evocative. My pick for the week ahead From Thursday 25 June, the Penarth Chamber Music festival weekend is being livestreamed, with repertoire gems by prime exponents of the genre, including David Adams, Alice Neary, Lesley Hatfield and Robert Plane."
"Two terrified boys are forced out of a car by members of a gang who taunt them with the question: “Were you kissing?” A paving stone is dropped on to the head of a lesbian by one of her relatives. A man’s screaming is captured as he is raped. These “trophy videos” are the hardest thing to watch in Welcome to Chechnya: The Gay Purge, a harrowing documentary about the persecution of LGBT people in the Russian republic. The videos were made by people who hunt down and and terrorise gay Chechens, with the backing of the government and security forces. “The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, is waging a ‘blood-cleansing operation’ to eliminate all LGBT people,” says the director, David France, speaking by Zoom from his home in New York. Thanks to nationalism, religious fundamentalism and Vladimir Putin’s “gay propaganda” law, LGBT people have become scapegoats. As one of the gang members tells the boys in the car: “All our problems are because of people like you.” France decided to make his film after reading a New Yorker article that described the heroic young activists of Russia’s LGBT network, who smuggle gay Chechens out of the state and into safe houses in Moscow or St Petersburg, then supervise their journeys out of Russia to claim asylum. The documentary contains dramatic footage, captured on iPhones and GoPro cameras, of gay Chechens known to the authorities making it past border guards and police to a fragile kind of safety. “I was posing as a ridiculous American tourist,” France says. “I had two phones. One for tourist things, another for shooting the extractions. When they asked for my phone, I was able to show the one meant for their eyes, and convince them I was just a thrill-seeker.” Coming out in the UK weeks after the video of George Floyd’s murder inflamed the Black Lives Matter movement, Welcome to Chechnya shows yet again how technology can now be used to expose scenes the authorities would rather keep from view. France’s biggest challenge was preserving his subjects’ anonymity. Homosexuality is stigmatised so much in Chechnya that families are actually pressured by the security forces to murder their gay members in “honour killings”. The sense of danger is stifling. When a desperate young man slits his wrists in a safe house, his handlers and fellow residents have to patch him up themselves, as calling an ambulance would alert the authorities to their clandestine operation. France’s solution was to use something similar to deepfake technology, but in the cause of telling the truth. “We asked other real people – mostly activists, mostly LGBTQ, mostly New York – to let us film them. An algorithm then maps their faces over the faces of people in the film. It’s really a kind of digital transplant. The people are doing and saying and reacting to things in exactly the same way. They’re just wearing a different face. And in many instances, we also replaced their voices.” At the film’s dramatic high point, one of these digital faces melts away as a subject discloses his true identity at a press conference. He announces that he is going to make a criminal complaint against the Russian authorities for failing to protect him, after he was captured and tortured in Grozny, the Chechen capital. Although the Russian courts immediately dismissed his case, claiming that there was no evidence, Maxim Lapunov is going to the European court of human rights, to date the only LGBT person who has dared to make such a challenge. France says Lapunov’s position is still precarious. “He and his family moved from place to place during the prosecution of their criminal complaint, so they are still living mostly in the margins, hoping that they will see some sort of justice. I think it’s fair to say they are not yet in their ultimate destination country, where they can live a more carefree life. Right now they are not carefree at all.” France started his career on the gay press in New York in the early 80s, just as gay men in the city started dying of a mysterious and incurable disease. Welcome to Chechnya is his third film. How to Survive a Plague – his first, which he later turned into an award-winning book – told the story of how a vociferous campaign by gay activist group Act Up relentlessly pushed the US medical establishment into making drugs available for people with Aids. The fact that it is now a manageable condition rather than a death sentence is a direct result of their determination. France is currently making a film about Covid-19, and points out parallels, not least the fact that Anthony Fauci, as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was in charge during both pandemics. “Globally, the researchers responsible for bringing about the miracle drugs in 1996 are still working today. There’s been a massive 30-year effort to find a vaccine against HIV, all of which has proved a failure so far. But the growth of knowledge in the field of vaccinology has been driven by the people doing HIV work. Those people immediately turned their attentions to Covid.” Back then, France says, Fauci was seen as a villain by Aids activists. “He could have saved tens of thousands of lives by directing his research dollars into ways that would prevent the opportunistic infections which were actually killing people with Aids. He was financing all sorts of biochemical research into attacking HIV, and not prioritising any monies into keeping people alive. And it’s not that it didn’t occur to him – activists were protesting at his door, calling him a murderer. He wouldn’t do it based on some kind of academic interpretation of his job – he felt it wasn’t his place to tell researchers what to research.” Today, France believes Fauci’s handling of coronavirus shows how much those Aids activists taught him. “I think the funding that’s coming out of the National Institute of Health is good. The budget priorities seem strong. What we would love is some sort of direct confrontation with Donald Trump, but he would argue that as long as he’s able to stay on the taskforce, he’s helping.” Having lived through one deadly pandemic, does he see any grounds for optimism about this one? “The science is there to help us in a way it wasn’t when HIV hit,” he says. Back then, “the field of immunology was still pretty young, the field of human retroviruses was brand new. Now we have experience working with coronaviruses. People had anticipated a coronavirus like this, so there was some preparatory work. I know they are feeling confident. So that gives me confidence.” However, France believes that a vaccine for Covid-19 may prove as elusive as one for HIV. “I think that this coronavirus will be with us for ever and we have to find a way to accommodate it.” There’s another echo of the Aids era in the stunning success of activists today – in this case Black Lives Matter exposing structural bigotry, not least in matters of health provision, given that black people are far more likely to die of Covid-19. “I know that Black Lives Matter has studied the Act Up model of activism,” says France, pointing out that its leadership includes queer and trans people. What makes a social justice movement successful? “Act Up teaches us that it’s not enough to demand something from others. The movement – which started as an organising idea to bring people to the streets to have their voices heard – had to join as partners with the people who could make the change. Black Lives Matter has been able to use the ability to fill the streets as a way to force doors open for the leadership to sit at the table.” In some ways, the spirits of Black Lives Matter and Act Up converge in the figure of Marsha P Johnson, the black trans woman who was at the Stonewall riot in 1969, which sparked the modern movement for gay rights. The subject of France’s 2016 film, The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson, drowned in murky circumstances in 1992. Her death was ruled a suicide and not properly investigated by the NYPD, but most of her friends believe she was murdered. Johnson – and her Latinx sidekick Sylvia Rivera, who crashed the 1973 New York gay pride parade to excoriate its middle-class whiteness and desire to marginalise trans people – loudly expressed the belief that liberation would only be possible when all LGBT people around the world were free. “It’s still illegal to be gay in 70 countries,” says France. “And in eight or more, it’s punishable by death. What’s going on in Chechnya is a campaign to root out and murder anybody they think is LGBTQ.” And while that’s the case, the fight must go on."
"Jimmy Kimmel offered the week’s award for “most ‘stooped’”, to quote Donald Trump’s misspelling of stupid on Twitter, to the president’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who “astonished even the most hardened among us” when he repeatedly answered “I do not” to the question “Do you believe there’s systemic racism against African Americans in the US?” “Sir, one more question: can you name a black person?” asked Kimmel. Kudlow’s answers were “so stupid I don’t think even Donald Trump would say it”. “This, by the way, is the same guy who said coronavirus was ‘contained’ three months ago, and he’s still there, reporting for duty. Only the best people,” Kimmel added. “On the other side of the coin – the side Lincoln is on,” Nascar announced this week it will no longer allow Confederate flags at its races. “So Nascar now has done more to fight racism than the president has,” Kimmel said. On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed “one of the biggest shifts” accomplished by the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police: the removal of Confederate monuments. This week, demonstrators removed a statue of Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, in Richmond, Virginia, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called on Congress to remove 11 Confederate statues at the Capitol. “Why did Congress have Confederate statues in the first place?” Noah wondered. “I mean, the Confederacy fought against America, so why would you have statues of them in America’s Capitol building? That makes no sense. It’s like white ladies having statues of gluten in their kitchen. “It’s a little insane how it feels like the government treats actual traitors better than black citizens,” Noah continued. “George Floyd maybe had a $20 bill that was counterfeit – he gets choked to death. The president of the Confederacy was responsible for half a million dead Americans, and the response is, ‘Let’s ask the quarry for the finest piece of marble, we’ve gotta remember this guy!’” And the army announced it would consider removing the names of Confederate officers from military bases. “I know for some people this debate might seem inconsequential,” Noah said, “but you gotta understand: the reason the military generals are open to changing the names of these bases is the same reason that Nascar is doing it – they want the military to take a unified stand against racism, and they want to show that the American military stands for all Americans, including the millions of minorities who have served within its ranks.” “Protests are continuing all over America, and if that makes you nervous, you might be a Confederate statue,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show, who called the army’s idea to remove Confederate leaders’ names from its bases “reasonable, considering those men waged war on the US military”. The bases were named at the height of Jim Crow, “so this seems like a slam dunk”, Colbert said. “Only someone completely tone deaf to the continuing pain of black Americans, who make up 20% of the US army, would disagree.” Of course, Trump disagreed and tweeted that the Confederate-honoring bases are part of a “Great American Heritage” and a “history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom”. “First, they didn’t fight for freedom,” Colbert retorted. “Second, winning and victory are the same thing, and the Confederacy didn’t do either of them. You’d know that if you weren’t stupid and an idiot.” Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign has planned a bus tour of several states despite the risks of coronavirus spreading in mass gatherings. “I guess he just misses walking out to a large crowd that he hasn’t teargassed,” said Colbert. His first rally is scheduled for 19 June, AKA Juneteenth, the annual holiday commemorating the end of slavery in America, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which 99 years ago this month was the site of one of the bloodiest, most destructive weeks of racial violence in the US, when white mobs destroyed “Black Wall Street”. “Now, to be fair, there’s no way Trump knows that much American history,” Colbert said. “I’m pretty sure he just told Stephen Miller, ‘Steve, just pick the most offensive date and location you can think of, and put it up there on my Hooters calendar.’” On Late Night, Seth Meyers reviewed the latest dismal polls for Trump, which show that his “political standing has eroded considerably over the past month”. “So Trump and his supporters in the GOP and on rightwing TV are resorting to the only two tactics they have left: amping up the racism and nursing deranged cultural grievances,” Meyers said. For example, after the army said they would consider renaming bases named after Confederate leaders, Trump tweeted a nonsensical dissent, which White House staffers printed out and handed to reporters at a briefing. “What do you mean they’re part of a ‘great American heritage’, a history of ‘winning, victory and freedom’?” Meyers wondered. “Confederates famously fought against America, and they lost. Since when do we name military bases after people who lost wars against America. Is there a naval base named after King George III? Would you make American soldiers train at Fort Il Duce? “I honestly can’t even believe it’s a question at this point whether or not we should be celebrating the symbols of an explicitly white supremacist cause like the Confederacy that fought to destroy the United States,” Meyers said. “And yet Nascar,” which banned the presence of Confederate flags at its races this week, “is doing more to lead right now than the president of the United States.”"
"“It’s been a truly brutal week, with protests across the country in response to the horrific killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police,” said John Oliver on Sunday’s Last Week Tonight, which was taped, he noted on Twitter, on Saturday morning (“that’s never great, and this week, it’s especially not-great.”) “There is clearly a lot to discuss here: how these protests are a response to a legacy of police misconduct both in Minneapolis and in the nation at large, and how that misconduct is in and of itself built on a legacy of white supremacy that prioritizes the comfort of white Americans over the safety of people of color. There is so much to say here – some of it complicated, much of it all too clear.  “Or, you know, you could just go on TV, open up your mouth, and let this shit fall out,” he said before playing a clip of Fox News host and “human boat shoe” Tucker Carlson. “Rioting is the one thing you don’t want,” Carlson said on his show over footage from violent clashes between police and protesters in Minneapolis. Carlson compared the violent protests with the now-infamous incident in Central Park last week in which a white woman called the cops on a black birdwatcher, who asked her to leash her dog, and feigned hysteria to gain a swift police response. “Ugly opinions, police brutality, officious birdwatchers, rude and entitled ladies walking their dogs in big-city parks – all of that is bad. But none of it is nearly as bad as what you just saw,” Carlson said. “OK, first: fuck you, Tucker,” Oliver responded. “That’s just a general point. Second, saying ‘officious birdwatcher’ is deeply offensive – because you’re either trying to both-sides that Central Park incident or insulting fans of this show, who proudly call themselves ‘officious birdwatchers’. I am the ‘officious bird’; they are the ‘watchers.’ Keep their name out of your mouth.” “People like Tucker love to venerate order at moments like this, and that’s easy to do when order in its current form is designed to benefit and protect you,” Oliver continued. “But it’s hard to overstate how clearly we’ve been reminded lately of the hostility of our existing order toward black people who’ve been killed by police on the street [George Floyd], killed by police in their own home [emergency room technician Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police on 13 March in Louisville], “killed by wannabe police in the street [Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot and killed while jogging in February by two white men in Georgia], and threatened with state violence while literally birding [Christian Cooper, the birdwatcher in Central Park]. “Collectively, that has just got to be some brutality bingo right there.” “And when ‘order’ results in you lying face-down on a lawn while your grandma stands between you and the police who have pulled their guns on you after you allegedly just rolled a stop sign,” he continued, in reference to Tye Anders, a 21-year-old Texan arrested in a terrifying ordeal with police in May. “I can see why being lectured on the importance of ‘order’ at the expense of all else is just not what you want to fucking hear right now!” And the president, Oliver noted, is baiting – the host pointed to his tweet from the weekend (which Twitter sanctioned for “glorifying violence”) in which he called the protesters “thugs” and said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “When a man like Donald Trump uses the word ‘thugs’, you know exactly what it’s code for,” said Oliver. “‘When the looting starts, the shooting starts,’ is actually a quote from a notoriously racist 1960s Miami police chief. And it is truly astounding how Donald Trump has managed to live 74 years with a remedial understanding of spelling, grammar, geography, science, civics nutrition and child development, and yet he’s the fucking Library of Alexandria when it comes to racist maxims of the 20th century.” Oliver’s main segment concerned the less explosive but extremely important issue of mail-in voting – the same issue which garnered Trump’s other Twitter censure last week, for his erroneous claim that it’s “substantially fraudulent”. Mail-in voting is actually common in many states with both Republican and Democratic-leaning governments, “and if this pandemic continues into the fall, as it most certainly will, many voters will want to do exactly that”, said Oliver. “Because think about it: holding an in-person election during a pandemic is an absolute nightmare. “The question isn’t ‘should we have voting by mail’ at all, because we already do,” Oliver explained. “It’s ‘how hard should we make it?’” That question depends on where you live – some states have significant restrictions on mail-in voting, such as Alabama, which requires mail-in ballots to include a photocopy of one’s state ID and a notary signed by two witnesses. Voter fraud is thus a crime that is “difficult, high-risk and low reward”, said Oliver. “It’s as if at the end of Ocean’s Eight, we learned that Sandra Bullock had gone to all the trouble of breaking into the Met Gala to steal a map of state’s quarters.” And while advocates argue that it will reduce obstacles to civic participation, “that in and of itself may be why it’s become so controversial”, Oliver said. “Conservative opponents often speculate that any increased participation would benefit Democrats despite the fact that researchers have consistently found that hasn’t obviously helped one party or the other.” The attempts to discredit mail-in voting during a pandemic is why “now is absolutely the time to talk about this,” Oliver concluded. “You cannot prepare for an election the same way you update your computer’s software, by just putting it off for months on end and secretly hoping that maybe you’ll be dead before you actually have to deal with it. We need to get this right, now.”"
"In March, a week after I went to a bar, saw live music and hugged my friends for what would be the last time in months, I invited six new friends into my lounge room, and their arguments and cackles would become the soothing soundtrack to my lockdown. With a new season of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills‌ scheduled to start in April and a clear social calendar for the foreseeable future, I decided to befriend Kyle Richards and her sister Kim, Camille Grammer (then-wife of Frasier star Kelsey), Adrienne Maloof, Taylor Armstrong and Lisa Vanderpump, the namesake and matriarch of my (other) favourite show about terrible people getting into arguments, Vanderpump Rules.  I’d seen enough reality TV shows – including the antipodean spinoffs of Andy Cohen’s Housewives franchise set in Melbourne, Sydney and Auckland – to know that I couldn’t just jump into the new season without first familiarising myself with the women and their personal histories (and feuds). I’m nothing if not a completist. Just as the mid-aughts success of The OC inspired the “reality” equivalent Laguna Beach – which spun off into The Hills, which spun off into myriad less-entertaining shows about individual characters – so too did the original season of Real Housewives take its cues from the hugely popular, fictionalised shows Desperate Housewives and Peyton Place. Behind the towering double doors of mega-mansions, we were told, were the wives wealthy men (aside from a few encounters with other women, Housewives are always in heterosexual partnerships) whose friendships and social dealings were much messier than their surface sheen would have you believe. In Beverly Hills, it’s all done against the backdrop of Hollywood, which makes it all the more insidious and excellent. The Richards sisters, Kyle and Kim, grew up as child stars in the town, and are introduced alongside flashbacks to their roles in Halloween (Kyle), Nanny and the Professor (Kim) and Little House on the Prairie (both), as well as family photos with their nieces, Paris and Nicky Hilton. Camille invites the women to see her husband’s Broadway show during season one, before his affair comes to light and their marriage breakdown becomes a plot point on the show and in the tabloids.  In later seasons, soap stars Eileen Davidson and Lisa Rinna join the cast, along with Garcelle Beauvais (Coming to America) and Denise Richards, whose bitchy eyebrow is as powerful in a talking head confession in 2020 as it was in the films Wild Things, Starship Troopers and Drop Dead Gorgeous. These women’s careers exist in a vast universe outside of this reality show, which mirrors the joy of consuming Real Housewives. The fun of an empire like this one is in the communal shorthand it breeds in fellow fans: you cannot Housewives alone. During the first socially distanced walk I took with a friend in April, we discussed the latest events in Vanderpump Rules, Summer House and Real Housewives of New York. In the park, we ran into another of my friends who was dying for someone with whom she could debrief on Beverly Hills’ fourth wall-breaking season premiere. From two metres away, I watched these two go from strangers to people with a shared language in minutes. During this marathon viewing event, I became fluent in the language of Beverly Hills. I saw Taylor Armstrong’s tortured argument that would go on to spawn the “woman yelling at cat” meme. I saw the famed Dinner Party From Hell episode where host Camille referred to a guest who had posed for Playboy following the OJ Simpson trial as “the morally corrupt Faye Resnick”. And, during the same dinner, I watched as Allison DuBois, the real-life inspiration for Patricia Arquette’s character in the scripted drama Medium, puffed on an e-cigarette (in 2010!) and, after throwing back cocktails in frosted martini glasses all night, got into a verbal brawl with Kyle Richards before saying, “I can tell you when she will die, and what will happen to her family. I love that about me!”  And after that, there were 10 more seasons waiting for me. There’s no time wasted scrolling Netflix for something new to watch when you’re only in season four and the housewives are on their way to Gigi Hadid’s graduation party where they’ll argue over a possibly cursed necklace! It’s difficult to put my finger on why shows like this are appealing enough to keep me from even considering watching anything else for the past few months (I still haven’t seen Tiger King, but based on the memes I have questions about Carole) because, on paper, they shouldn’t appeal to anyone with a brain or a heart. They paint a picture of women’s lives as consumerist fantasy where collecting more wealth and fame are the ultimate goal and displaying any social or political awareness can brand you an outcast. The highlight in each season is usually a dinner party, trip overseas or cocktail function to launch a boutique/real estate agency/fundraising effort/skincare line/rosé collaboration/dog rescue centre where people scream, dredge up past grudges and point fingers.  Keeping track of these feuds and friendships constitutes the most fun I’ve had in my house all year."
"Stephen Colbert returned to The Late Show from a 10-day vacation to an America on fire, and addressed “the story that has pushed 100,000 Covid deaths below the fold … America’s pre-existing condition: racism”. The protests in dozens of cities have stemmed from what Colbert called the “extrajudicial execution” of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, a white on-duty Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. “Now, in civilized countries, that’s called murder,” said Colbert. And yet, despite video evidence of the entire interaction, it took four days for Chauvin to be arrested and charged with third-degree murder; the three other officers involved, who watched but did not intervene, have not been charged with any crime. “So if you’re wondering why people are so upset, it’s because this is so upsetting.” Floyd’s killing comes on the heels of the murder of Breonna Taylor, an emergency technician shot by police in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, in April, and Ahmaud Arbery, shot by two white men in Georgia while out for a jog in February, which “also has eerie similarities to Eric Garner in 2014”, said Colbert. “And in that same year there was the case of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Tamir Rice in Cleveland. All of those echo Emmett Till and the Scottsboro Boys, which happened in the context of Jim Crow, which itself was a soft relaunch of slavery. So you’ve really got to go back to the Triangle trade, which ultimately stems from man’s inhumanity to man, and our essential fallen nature. So, maybe start with the Garden of Eden.” The point is: this is nothing new, and “we need empathetic and moral leadership. Unfortunately, we have Donald Trump.  “Now, I make a lot of jokes about Donald Trump because he is a dull and dark corrupting force that is undermining America’s moral leadership around the world and sowing hatred and fear among his own citizens,” said Colbert. “And during this Covid crisis, the president has totally abdicated his responsibility of leading the people to understand the need to do the right thing for themselves and each other. And yet, the large majority of Americans have done the right thing anyway. And my hope is that the American people will do the same thing now, because ultimately, they have to.  “For too long, those of us with opportunity and privilege have failed in our responsibility to look at the truth squarely and name the system of racial oppression that artificially divides Americans and benefits those already in positions of relative power,” Colbert continued. “It’s time to ask ourselves, as it is always time to ask ourselves, what kind of nation do we want to live in? That answer requires moral leadership. So take it upon yourself to be a leader and set an example for the kind of country you want to live in.” “If you had any doubts at all about the dangers of our overly militarized police culture, those doubts were answered in the response to nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night, citing numerous examples of police being “needlessly violent” or escalating encounters with peaceful protesters for seemingly no reason.  “The police can’t even get through protests about police brutality without committing more police brutality,” he said. “It’s like if your wife accused you of having an affair in divorce court, and you tried to smooth it over by seducing the judge. “Even just showing up to a protest in riot gear with military equipment is a form of escalation,” Meyers continued as he played footage from police rolling through the streets of Columbia, South Carolina, with a tank. “Ask yourself: why do local police departments have tanks when doctors and nurses can’t even get masks and gowns? We spend billions on military equipment for police and healthcare workers have to wear snorkel masks like retirees on vacation in the Caribbean. There are teachers in this country who are drowning in debt and have to spend their own money on supplies for their classrooms. If anyone deserves a tank, it’s them.” We know police escalation isn’t necessary, Meyers added, because “just a few weeks ago, police were physically confronted by angry rightwing protesters calling for an end to lockdowns, and oddly, they seemed to have left their tanks and teargas at home.” In the face of police escalation, “the very least we can do, the absolute minimum, is to acknowledge there is a deeply rooted, systemic problem here,” Meyers concluded, which is “that there’s a predatory system with a history of police misconduct built on a legacy of racism and exploitation that elevates the comfort and security of white people over the health and safety of black people”. And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon offered “a different kind of show” – a mea culpa after it was reported last week that Fallon had once donned blackface to impersonate Chris Rock during his time at Saturday Night Live. Fallon said he was “horrified” that the story emerged, “not at the fact that people were trying to cancel me or cancel the show, which is scary enough, but the thing that haunted me the most was how do I say: ‘I love this person? I respect this guy more than I respect most humans. I am not racist, I don’t feel this way.’  “Instead, what I kept getting advised was to just stay quiet and not say anything,” Fallon said. “And that’s the advice because we’re all afraid. And I took it for a minute.” Fallon explained that he thought, “I’m going to say something and get myself into even more trouble … I don’t know what to do,” but “realized that I can’t not say I’m horrified and I’m sorry.” The “breaking my own silence”, he said, pointed him in the direction of experts such as the NAACP president, Derrick Johnson, his guest on the show, who made him realize that “the silence is the biggest crime that white guys like me and the rest of us are doing”. “We need to say something, we need to keep saying something. And we need to say ‘that’s not OK’ more than just one day on Twitter,” Fallon urged. “We can’t just hope that everyone loves each other. We can’t say, ‘be the change.’”"
"My friend and fellow poet Glenn Carmichael, who has died aged 65 of liver cancer, was a radiant light in British performance poetry. He was charismatic, generous, funny and damn cool; the man who introduced poetry slamming to Bristol and kickstarted the city’s performance poetry scene. He encouraged many people to develop their careers as poets and writers. Glenn was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the youngest of three children of Nigel, a railway technician, and Marjorie (nee Payne), district manager for Avon Cosmetics. He went to Branksome secondary school (now Branksome comprehensive) in Darlington, County Durham. He studied sculpture at Cardiff School of Art and Design and was exhilarated by the punk explosion. His performance career began in London in 1978 when he fronted the Twilight Zoners (providing vocals as Gordon Twilight). In 1981, Glenn formed a rap band, the White Brothers, with Kevin “Spider” Evans. Along with Dave Littler, the trio supported such bands as A Certain Ratio, Funkapolitan and Bauhaus. Glenn greatly admired the American Beat poets and, in 1988, he and Spider became a performance duo, the Big City Beats. They ran the Hard Edge Club in Soho for five years and showcased top performance poets. After a spell in rehab, Glenn arrived in Bristol in 1993, keen to energise performance poetry. The city was heady with trip-hop, and Glenn was in the right place at the right time. In 1994, he witnessed his first poetry slam at Glastonbury festival and realised this was the way forward. In the same year, he entered the Nuyorican Poetry Slam in New York (he was runner-up), then organised a slam at the Arnolfini centre in Bristol. It was a massive success and the Bristol Poetry Slam was born. Glenn and his co-host, Claire Williamson, ran intercity slams, the UK Poetry Slam Championships 1997 and events with luminaries such as John Cooper Clarke and Brett Anderson, and took slamming to hundreds of schools. He and I enjoyed a close creative alliance, launching Pimp$ of the Alphab£t Press and touring collaborative spoken-word shows, The Truth Is Optional (1996), and later Flash and Count Me In with Lucy English. Glenn’s novel Still Searching for the Big City Beats (2000), written with Spider, is regarded as a cult classic and is the first British novel to use the spoken-word scene as its backdrop. An inspirational teacher, he taught novel writing for the Workers’ Educational Association from 2001, on what was roundly regarded as a brilliant course. “It was the beginning of it all for me,” says Emma Smith-Barton, shortlisted for the Waterstones children’s book prize 2020. Glenn completed an MA in creative writing at Bath Spa University in 2016. At the time of his death, he was writing a new novel, Nobody Came. Glenn is survived by his wife, Juliet (nee Hutchinson), whom he met at a film-showing at Watershed Media Centre, Bristol, in 2003 and married in 2005, and his sister, Rae."
"On Tuesday’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert addressed the fallout from Donald Trump’s latest shocking distraction tactic: his claim to reporters on Monday that he’s taking the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine – a drug the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specifically advised not to take for coronavirus as it has potentially lethal side-effects – as protection. “Look, I don’t care how you feel politically, we have to protect the president of the United States. There’s just no way to dismiss the seriousness of death,” Colbert said, then cut to a clip of Trump telling reporters off-handedly: “Death is death.” “I stand corrected,” said Colbert. Trump’s claim alarmed several public health officials, as well as the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who told CNN’s Anderson Cooper she was concerned the president would take an unrecommended, potentially dangerous drug “especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group – what is morbidly obese, they say”. “Oh, that is a very polite way to say a mean thing,” said Colbert, imitating Pelosi. “I’m concerned about the president because he is, shall we say, 20lb of pudding in a 10lb sack. What I’m saying is, your president is so fat that when he sits around the White House, he – shall I put this diplomatically? – sits around the White House, which is a very, very large building indeed.” Pelosi’s comments were panned by many, and “it’s important to point out that fat-shaming is wrong”, Colbert noted. “Plenty of wonderful people are old and fat and beloved, like Santa. But guess what? Santa shouldn’t take hydroxychloroquine either.” Asked about Pelosi’s comments by a reporter, Trump retorted: “I don’t respond to her, I think she’s a waste of time.” Trump should know, Colbert said, as “he is the world’s leading authority on wasting time. This one time, there was this huge, deadly global pandemic and he didn’t do anything about it for like two months! It was a personal best in being just the worst.” “Are you serious? Trump has been experimenting with hydroxychloroquine?” Trevor Noah said on the Daily Show on Trump’s explosive comments. “At this point, what unhealthy thing isn’t Trump doing?” he added. “He’s taking hydroxychloroquine, he eats fast food every day, and yet he is still alive? I wouldn’t be surprised if one day we find an ancient cave painting and right in the middle of all the cavemen we find Trump, ‘fake news’, ‘I never touched that dinosaur’.” No one knows if Trump is telling the truth about taking the drug, Noah continued. “Maybe he’s trying to distract from the inspector general story, or from all the coronavirus deaths, or from the fact that his most trusted adviser is actually one of those South Korean soccer dolls,” said Noah, referring to Jared Kushner. “We’ll never know. “So Trump is either taking a dangerous, ineffective drug or he’s lying about doing it just for the LOLs,” Noah added. As for Pelosi’s comments on the matter, Noah could only facepalm. “Mocking the president’s weight also makes a lot of people who aren’t Trump feel like shit too,” he said. “So please, just remember: Trump’s not an asshole because of what goes into his mouth. He’s an asshole because of what comes out of it.” “You have to hand it to Trump – just when you think it can’t get any crazier, he starts popping FDA-disapproved drugs and telling everyone else to try it, too,” said Jimmy Kimmel on the hydroxychloroquine fiasco. “Our president is a hydroxymoron. It’s hard to process but are we surprised that the guy who thought windmills caused cancer thinks a lupus drug kills coronavirus?” To be fair, Kimmel continued, “I don’t think Trump has any idea what drugs he takes every day. He’s like a dog – Mike Pompeo just puts the pills in peanut butter and feeds it to him.” So why say he’s taking an unproven drug? Kimmel thought about it for awhile, he said, and came to the “the only reasonable conclusion: he’s trying to kill himself. “Remember how we all said he didn’t really want to be president?” Kimmel said. “Well guess what, I think we were right.” Kimmel joked that Trump is trying to end his presidency with the dangerous drug, since “he’s done everything possible to make sure no one would ever want to vote for him again: he colluded with Russia, he extorted Ukraine, he declared his love for Kim Jong-un, he made fun of John McCain, he threw paper towels at Puerto Ricans, he paid off a porn star, in the middle of a pandemic, he wants to reopen the mall. “The man stared directly into an eclipse, and none of it worked – he’s still popular, and he’s still trapped in that White House, and there’s only one way out now: a big glass of bleach with a hydro and Z-pack chaser.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers traced Trump’s hydroxychloroquine comments back to his long history of shilling scammy products, such as Trump Vodka and Trump University. Given his track record, Meyers said, it makes sense that Trump would claim to personally take a potentially dangerous drug he’s been hawking as a miracle cure for weeks, citing “I get a lot of positive calls about it” as evidence. “Your evidence is that you hear good stories and get positive calls about it … we’re talking about a potentially dangerous medication, not the new hibachi place in town,” said Meyers. “Look, Trump’s gonna say and do crazy shit,” Meyers added. “He failed on the pandemic response and unemployment is at its highest point in 100 years, so now he’s spraying ink in the water so he can dart under a rock before the press can figure out what happened. We don’t have to spend all day dissecting it, debating whether it’s a chess move or a planned distraction – the guy doesn’t play chess. He doesn’t even know how to close an umbrella. Watching him play chess would be like asking your dog to change the channel on the remote control.” The drug’s benefits are unproven, Meyers continued, and side-effects can include agitation, confusion, insomnia, mania, hallucinations and paranoia. “So either Trump’s lying about taking it … or he’s been taking it for 73 years.”"
"Bafflingly left off Pop – it was released on the B-side of Staring at the Sun – North and South of the River is audibly better than swathes of that album: a low-key excursion into something resembling trip-hop, replete with breakbeat and lo-fi orchestral samples and particularly yearning Bono vocal. If All That You Can’t Leave Behind returned U2 to something like their pre-Achtung Baby selves, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb’s roaring lead single took them back even further: inspired once more by the Sex Pistols and Buzzcocks, it stripped their sound to its elemental punk roots: one guitar, bass, drums. Once they had shaken off their youthful obsession with Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, U2 seldom sounded like anyone other than U2. In a Little While, however, has a 70s Rolling Stones feel to it. Subsequently covered by both Hanson and William Shatner, it’s a lovely, loose ode to enduring romance. U2’s debut single is very much a product of its era, further bedevilled by the difficult recording session at which the band’s own technical limitations were revealed. Re-recorded for 1980’s Boy, however, Out of Control shone, its blazing youthful power fully revealed itself. The contents of Songs of Innocence were overshadowed by the controversy over its means of distribution – oddly enough, not everyone wanted a U2 album to automatically appear in their iTunes library – but they were better than the reviews suggested: produced by Danger Mouse, Sleep Like a Baby Tonight’s lambent tune and electronic pulse deserve reassessment. Another song worth salvaging from the wreckage of Pop, the drum machine-driven The Playboy Mansion is raggedly charming, its lyrics casting an ambiguous eye over media bombardment, celebrity and advertising, its guitar snaking around Bono’s low-key vocal. U2’s contribution to the soundtrack of Batman Forever might well be their own charming homage to Marc Bolan, albeit put through a distinct Zooropa-era filter: the string arrangement is pure Children of the Revolution, the guitars crunch very T Rex-ily, there’s a distinct hint of a “glam descend” chord sequence about the chorus. Cursed with the kind of title guaranteed to get U2 naysayers rolling their eyes, Cedars of Lebanon is nevertheless one of No Line on the Horizon’s scattered highlights: sonically muted and misty, the vocals oddly conversational, its tone weary and sombre, it feels focused and potent where the rest of the album feels confused. Kraftwerk apparently lurked among the regular musical diet of the nascent U2, but it took until 2014 for their influence to really make itself heard. Invisible’s blend of classic U2-isms with motorik drums and Autobahn synths is the most successful of their recent attempts to reboot their sound. There’s a sense that U2’s vast commercial success means their willingness to experiment gets overlooked, but The Joshua Tree’s second side is thick with impressive diversions into the musical left field, as evidenced by its closing track’s ominous, chilling ambient noise. As befits a song originally intended for Frank Sinatra, Stay pared back the sonic overload of much of Zooropa, leaving U2 more or less au naturel. Its live sound bolsters the song’s beautifully elegant, elegiac, small-hours tone, its lyric inspired by the plot of the Wim Wenders film they wrote it for. At the other extreme to Gloria’s breast-beating lurked October’s title track, an austere, suitably autumnal-sounding piano ballad in which Bono’s vocals arrive only in the final 50 seconds. “Joy Division had gone to our heads,” shrugged the singer years later, but there’s a hushed, stark beauty to the track. U2’s most recent albums have been marred by the audible sense of a band trying too hard, but Songs of Experience’s highlight felt effortless. Its shifts from soft and sad to rousing are the sound of a band not worrying about their place in the modern pop landscape and being themselves. A fantastic example of Achtung Baby’s ability to adapt current musical trends so they fit into U2’s universe, rather than vice-versa, the shuffling, vaguely “baggy” dance rhythm here supports a retelling of the story of Judas Iscariot, a song that alternately broods and soars and a particularly sky-scraping Edge solo. The song that in effect sent U2 supernova plays fast and loose with the facts of Martin Luther King’s murder – he was shot in the afternoon, not the morning – but it hardly matters. As straightforward a lunge for anthem status as they had yet recorded, Pride worked. Either a paean to Bono’s goggle-eyed first trip to London, or a description of Manhattan, City of Blinding Lights isn’t about taking risks so much as U2 doing what U2 were put on Earth to do – make music that’s atmospheric but anthemic, uplifting but soul-searching – and doing it absolutely perfectly. Julian Schnabel’s The Diving Bell and the Butterfly features a scene soundtracked by Ultraviolet: the film’s paralysed protagonist remembering a car journey with his lover, her hair flowing in the wind. It is an extraordinary piece of film-making that perfectly captures Ultraviolet’s power, the most musically uplifting of U2’s examinations of faith. Pop is generally regarded as U2’s latter-day nadir: its recording was rushed, its attempt at grafting samples and loops on to U2’s sound ungainly, and even its title managed to upset US rock fans. But occasionally, it worked, as on Mofo, an improbably titled song about the death of Bono’s mother, complete with thrilling, Giorgio Moroder-ish synth line. U2 have been resident in the world’s stadiums for so long, it is easy to forget they were once a post-punk band. (They would doubtless argue they still are.) It is very clear here, a song about alienation and electro-convulsive therapy, vocals hidden amid trebly, reverb-heavy guitars, drums heavy on tom-tom thunder. At the other emotional extreme to Beautiful Day lies All That You Can’t Leave Behind’s anguished response to the death of Michael Hutchence. More complex and affecting than a standard issue tear-jerker, its lyric keeps shifting from sadness and empathy to anger at its subject: “You’re such a fool.” Zooropa was Achtung Baby’s scrappier sibling: if you wanted evidence of the distance U2 had travelled in recent years, the title track’s experimental, episodic collision of ambience, distorted vocals and densely affected guitar was a good place to start. Moreover, they somehow did it without surrendering their, well, U2-ness. Inspired by a trip to El Salvador, Bullet the Blue Sky’s tribal drums, dub bass and arcs of guitar noise sound like a bold attempt to turn the experiments of post-punk into something stadium-sized. Extra fun can be had imagining Mark E Smith’s reaction when he learned the chorus was based on a Fall track. U2’s second album could have been their last – a confused exploration of spirituality, it nearly pre-empted a split – but when it worked, as on towering opener Gloria, it underlined what a different proposition U2 were. Who else among their peers would write an open-hearted, earnest celebration of Christian faith? Not all of U2’s recent lunges for contemporaneity have worked (who in their right minds wants to hear Bono singing through Auto-Tune?) but Songs of Innocence’s concluding duet with Lykke Li did. A slow drift that never deals directly with the conflict in the title, but focuses on the impact that growing up near conflict has on one’s personality. From its opening blast of chaotic guitar, The Fly boldly announces things are not as they were in the world of U2. Out goes earnestness that could border on painful, in come more murky, ambiguous songs sung in character. “Conscience can be a pest,” offers Bono, as if starkly critiquing his former self, “ambition bites the nails of success.” Rattle and Hum marked the point at which U2 allowed their passion and self-belief – and indeed their reaction to superstardom – to slip into bombast, but sometimes its experiments with US roots music work. Fizzing with their enthusiasm for music forbidden under post-punk’s rules, Desire’s irresistible Bo Diddley beat is evidence. Inspired by the rise in heroin use in 80s Dublin, Bad looms large in U2 legend. The original is hypnotic and slow-burning, delicately shaded with Brian Eno’s electronics, the perfect launchpad for onstage development. Most famously, they played it for 12 minutes at Live Aid, a performance they thought was a disaster, but which turned out to be a highlight. U2’s first truly great song was a product of its era – Public Image-esque guitars, the vocal influence of Siouxsie particularly evident on the chorus, a hint of DIY experimentation in its percussive use of cutlery and a bicycle wheel – but it hoisted its influences into the service of music expressly built for crowds to sing along and punch the air to. The unexpected result of Adam Clayton attempting, and failing, to play the bass line to Visage’s Fade to Grey, U2’s breakthrough hit had what Bono admitted was a sketchy lyric about Poland’s political upheavals. It didn’t matter: its anthem status rests on the emotional shift between the jagged iciness of its verses and the warmth and yearning of the chorus. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb’s greatest track remains Bono’s rumination on his complex relationship with his dying father. It’s the perfect counter-argument to those who feel U2’s music exists solely on a grand scale, painted in emotional brushstrokes too broad for its own good. Incisive and personal, it is heartbreakingly frank. Achtung Baby’s singles employed a lot of hip dance remixers: the shimmering synths and falsetto vocals of Zooropa’s Lemon seemed to seamlessly integrate the sound of a hip dance remix into U2’s own. It is helped by the fact the song itself is great; you could strip it of its production and it would still work. Returning to Achtung Baby’s many remixes, Paul Oakenfold’s version of Even Better Than the Real Thing was the most famous, but then his source material was fantastic: a rattlingly exciting song about the desire for immediate gratification – “Slide down the surface of things” – that now seems remarkably prescient. A commercial disappointment – selling a mere 5m copies – the album No Line on the Horizon was muddled and, in Larry Mullen’s words, “fucking miserable”. Finding its highlights requires a degree of sifting, but its title track is fantastic: a wracked vocal over a pulsing wall of guitar effects, the intensity of which ebbs and flows throughout the song. Trailed as a return to basics after the failed experiment of Pop, All That You Can’t Leave Behind wasn’t quite as straightforward as that, but U2 songs come no more direct and powerful than its lead single. Everything about Beautiful Day clicks perfectly, the apparent effortlessness of its widescreen euphoria at odds with its tricky gestation. By now, U2 could knock out potent stadium rock to order, as evidenced by Pride, but The Unforgettable Fire’s best moments are more opaque, less direct. The title track is atmospheric, synth-heavy and dense with serpentine melodies, its euphoric power gradually building over the course of five minutes. The gospel inflections and earnest tone of I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For are precisely the kind of thing that winds up U2’s detractors. But blessed with a melody that sounds it has somehow always existed, its strength lies in the fact that it doesn’t deal in pious sermonising; its expressions of spiritual doubt are disarmingly heartfelt. Of all Rattle And Hum’s attempts to tap into American music history, employing former Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks for All I Want Is You was the most inspired. His complex but beautiful string arrangement turns a straightforward love song into something richer, adding an undercurrent of uncertainty to Bono’s vocal proclamations. A lot has been written about Sunday Bloody Sunday’s lyrics – a non-sectarian, pacifist view of the Troubles – but its power lies in the way its sound keeps lurching back and forth from a clattering racket strafed with feedback and scraping violin to something more straightforward and palatable: a killer riff coupled with the singalong-inducing refrain: “How long must we sing this song?” Daringly at odds with then-prevalent trends for pumped-up and musclebound stadium rock, With Or Without You’s examination of faith and/or love is simple to the point of sounding stark: subtle, even subdued, never reaching the big climax you expect. None of which stopped it going to No 1 in the US, a very counterintuitive way of becoming the biggest band in the world. “Heavy-bottomed but light-headed” in the words of the producer Brian Eno, Mysterious Ways is one of a number of Achtung Baby tracks to bear the influence of contemporary indie-dance, an inspiration U2 were able to assimilate remarkably well, hence this gleefully lubricious blast of wah-wah guitar, congas and funky bass. Achtung Baby is rightly heralded as one of the great 180-degree artistic turns a major band has ever performed, but at its heart lies a traditionally U2-esque song: a love ballad that reaches for bigger topics – “We’re one, but we’re not the same, we get to carry each other” – so emotionally powerful it apparently reduced Axl Rose, of all people, to floods of tears. Where the Streets Have No Name had inauspicious beginnings: in effect written to order – The Joshua Tree was “short [of] a certain kind of song”, the Edge later recalled – the band struggled to record it, and Eno was so unimpressed he attempted to wipe the tape. He would have erased a song that perfectly sums up U2’s appeal. Powered by a particularly gripping example of Edge’s patent echo-drenched arpeggios, it is breathlessly exciting without ever resorting to rock anthem cliche (the time signature changes twice). The lyrics seem to be as much about the ability of music to inspire joyful transcendence as the divisions in Belfast that inspired them and the chorus soars irresistibly. “The ultimate U2 live song,” Edge suggested. He was right."
"At 2.30pm Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre and Maria Balshaw, director of Tate art museums and galleries, convene on screen – the new abnormal – for a conversation about the Covid-19 crisis and how they plan to help their institutions survive it. Norris is first to admit our get-together is not ideal as his blurred silhouette appears: “I’m at home, in the bedroom, because it’s the best internet spot. If things get really bad, I’ll have to speak to you on the phone.” Balshaw, at home in Kent, is similarly quick to identify the idiosyncrasies in her new working life: “I’ve got my museum director husband [Nick Merriman, chief executive of Horniman Museum] with me – we rotate in and out of this room.” Erratic bandwidth is the least of the problems Norris and Balshaw face. Before lockdown, there was a £110bn creative industries sector, the fastest-growing in the UK. Now, the challenge is to keep cultural institutions out of intensive care. For although Arts Council England has launched a £160m emergency package across the cultural sector, the longer our museums and theatres remain closed, the more perilous their future becomes. But beyond the immediate question of when the Tate and National might reopen, this is, more positively, a moment of potential change: there are questions of how cultural appetites are altering as art in lockdown becomes more democratic. And questions about whether the Covid-19 crisis will make a good subject for theatre. What sort of art might develop post-lockdown? But before looking ahead, it is necessary to look back – not least because of the way time seems to be behaving in our new world (moving so fast in one sense, so slowly in another). I begin by asking Norris and Balshaw to remember how they felt as they locked down their institutions. Did they have any idea what was to come? Rufus Norris: It was very odd because we were told in the most blunt, ill-considered way that people were not to go to theatres before we were given any warning or told to shut. Boris’s announcement came just before a meeting with the cast of The Visit. We decided mutually the actors could not go on. Afterwards, I walked into the Olivier at 7.30 – the show should already have been running – and sat in the empty theatre. I remember thinking: how long will it be before I’m back in this theatre again? My overriding thought was about safety. This had all come up very quickly. I felt a bit naive, felt that collectively perhaps we should not have relied on government and made our own call earlier. Maria Balshaw: Like Rufus, looking back, I wonder why I didn’t realise sooner that what happened needed to happen. The truth is we were all living in real time and society as a whole didn’t realise. I remember the acute strangeness of opening the Andy Warhol show at Tate Modern on 10 March. Our donors did not want to be there – already worried about the virus. The president of the Andy Warhol Foundation had flown over from New York and was saying: “Everyone thinks I’m crazy but I wanted to be here and witness this.” The opening felt incredibly celebratory yet presaging of disaster to come. How have your feelings changed over the ensuing weeks?RN: It’s been so fast-moving. The problem with closing down an organisation on the scale of the National is it takes a huge amount of effort, furloughing – nobody even knew how to spell that word a few weeks ago – and emergency planning. It’s like scrabbling in a swimming pool, trying to find the steps. When you don’t know what’s going on for a long period, it’s incredibly wearing. As the leader of an organisation, you’re not doing the job unless you look at the worst so you can start trying to plan ahead. MB: At the beginning, it was shocking but people thought the crisis would last three weeks. Possibly six. Now we’re at a moment where we have to think about more than the recovery of individual institutions and our sectors. We’ve got to start thinking: how do we shape the world for the new normal? The pressures we’re under – financial, practical and emotional – mean we’ll not be the same on the other side. When do you expect to open?RN: That’s the million-dollar question. Maria and I are in different sectors from that point of view – our business is about bringing large groups of people together. About 60 to 70% of the National’s income comes from people visiting and buying tickets. We’re very supportive of the government’s policy on social distancing. But the reality, in blunt terms, is that if we have two metres social distancing we can only sell one ticket in six or seven – which is not viable. Teatro Franco Parenti in Milan is reducing seating from 500 to 65…RN: With the levels of subsidy in some European houses, that might be worth it but it’s out of the question for a commercial theatre. Cameron Mackintosh says theatres are unlikely to reopen until 2021 – is this unduly pessimistic?RN: He’s possibly right: he’s talking about his theatres getting back to a place where audiences are comfortable to come back in large numbers. That’s going to require audience confidence which may only return when there’s a vaccine. Until social distancing can be relaxed, it’s hard to imagine getting back to a place where we can become viable. In terms of the timetable, we’ve plans for September. We’ve plans for January. I’m making plans for April 2021. But I have to say the January and the April 2021 plans would involve us going insolvent. Without additional government support 70% of theatres will be boarded by Christmas. When will the NT’s money run out?RN: It depends on furloughing. If it keeps going, it won’t cover all our costs but will give us longer. Our turnover is £100m a year. In full swing, it costs two million a week to keep the place going. Some money comes from the Arts Council but we’re losing several million a month. MB: Like the National, we have reserves but even an organisation as large as Tate will face massive challenges. Rufus will be cross with me if I’m not frank about that. We’ll face a huge challenge if we have an extended period with very few visitors. The reopening of the Tate’s galleries won’t be immediate. Museums fall into the third phase of easing of restrictions which means London museums might open late July through to September, probably a few at a time. What plans are you putting into place?MB: All my colleagues are working at fever pitch to see how we can make museums open yet socially distant. How should we deal with hygiene and safety issues? How do we think about the numbers of people coming to us? In London, one of the biggest issues is going to be public transport. We don’t want it overwhelmed. We’ll be advocating that people who live locally walk to our institutions. I walk to work on good days – a fantastic thing to do in London. Will Tate have to start charging for entry?MB: We’ve done a remarkable amount through lockdown to reach new audiences. I want us to be there for the whole British public even if we have to welcome people in smaller numbers. I wouldn’t want to put a barrier in the way of anyone coming. Free entry is more important than ever. RN: We’re also looking into everything. We’ve a whole team working on creative ideas about social distancing. Can you get people masks? Can you build extra toilets? Can you only pre-order drinks? Can you put plastic screens between people on seats? What happens if you just do every other seat? We’ve cut production budgets in half. We’ve had wage cuts that our brilliant staff have had to take and it’s much worse for freelancers – they’re in a desperate position. The playwright James Graham suggests an “aggressive government bailout” is needed…RN: “Aggressive government bailout” feels blunt but we’ll need government support. The Arts Council does not expect us to fulfil our duties during lockdown – it’s not as if we have zero money coming in. MB: We too have a grant in aid but, like the National, Tate earns 70% of its income through visitors. People coming back is what we need. I agree with Rufus the job retention scheme has been a godsend but we’ll also need further financial backing from the government. And any challenge for the Tate will be even more threatening for smaller institutions. This is going to be a period of the most acute challenge the arts ecology has ever faced. And will smaller theatres survive?RN: Without support – no. If this goes on much longer, it’s very hard to imagine any theatre surviving. Whatever it means for the National, you can multiply several times for regional theatres. A lot of our work now is about advocacy to make sure the government, under huge pressure as it is, understands what our sector contributes and how urgent it is that a nuanced, informed view of helping us survive is taken on by them. How worried are you by surveys reporting that many people are frightened by the relaxation of lockdown? Does your role include a need to reassure the public?MB: Our world has changed beyond recognition. It’s understandable people feel fearful. Museums, galleries and the arts have a huge role to play in rebuilding social confidence. People may have to come differently – book a time slot, come in one way, leave another way. We’ll need to reassure the public the numbers will not put them at risk. And this is urgent because of another challenge our country now faces: people’s emotional wellbeing, social connections and mental health. RN: The worst thing would be if we opened too early because of financial need. If we rushed back and audiences came to our spaces and we hadn’t looked after them properly and they got sick – that must not be allowed to happen. It would be a disaster if we opened up and had to close down again. Reassurance will only be possible when the time is right. I gather you’ve been ill with the virus yourself, Rufus?RN: I was very ill for a couple of weeks but thankful it didn’t take me to hospital. I know a lot of people who have been very ill. Has this period made you reflect on what your jobs are for now that getting bums on seats/people through doors is out of the equation?MB: We’re dealing with large-scale disaster management yet, in a more profound way, this crisis reminds us why human beings need art. You can see the hunger for it and people’s desire to create themselves. The silver lining of what we’re going through is that people have been given time back and are using it to make paintings, throw pots, watch theatre, dance and sing. RN: Or they’re also going back to their photographs or getting creative in the kitchen or garden – the surge of creativity is really encouraging. There’ll be a generation, won’t there? The lockdown generation – who really got on with stuff while they had the space. MB: I was particularly moved by the singing on balconies in Italy. It’s people saying: I’ll not be silent in the face of fear. It gets to the heart of why we make art. And then there was Sacha Lord’s livestream Hacienda-style Manchester club night that went on the whole night, attracted millions and raised funds for that bit of the creative sector. What a brilliant idea – people raving in their own homes! That’s an image I want to hold on to…. Meanwhile NT at Home is hugely popular and has received more than £100,000 in donations…RN: It’s had 8 million views in the last five weeks. We weren’t expecting the donations but are now able to pay the actors. We’re introducing a broader range of titles. Our initial thinking was: people are going through a tough time, so what do they want? They want a comedy, so One Man, Two Guvnors… Sometimes, theatre can be a way of saying: “Just relax…” Will there be a new appetite for live art post-lockdown?MB: Just as people need to be back out in the world, they need to be seeing and thinking about art – it’s not a luxury. People have discovered so many new things digitally. It’s the hook that’s going to give them confidence to step out of their front doors again. I’ve made some wonderful discoveries during lockdown such as the live stream of Broken Wings by ENB – a ballet about Frida Kahlo. RN: I’ve found a variety of things – I especially enjoyed The Fireman’s Ball by Miloš Forman. I watched it with my partner and our two sons – a simple film, a satire. It appealed to our particular, weird, family taste. It’s hilarious. We have, obviously, been spending a lot more time together as a family – the one unadulterated, wonderful upside of lockdown. Are you in touch with colleagues in Europe and the US?MB: We’re actively in conversation in Europe, North America and beyond – we’re having Zoom meetings with colleagues in Italy and China because they’re at a different phase – there’s a huge amount to learn from them. We’re having brilliant creative conversations about how to reschedule touring exhibitions, make sure nobody loses out and let things happen over a longer time frame. RN: David Lan [playwright and director] recently organised a call with European, American and British artistic directors. In normal times, theatre can be a competitive environment but we all believe in what this sector brings to society and we’re working together. Will lockdown/coronavirus make a good subject for art/theatre?RN: Yes – although it is difficult when you’re in the middle of something to understand what impact it will have. But new writing is sure to emerge… If we reopen in September, what will people want to watch? They’re going to be nervous. We’ll have to give them a good reason to come and make it a real event… MB: Early in lockdown, one of my staff – an artist – sent a lovely message saying: “The artists among us have been practising lockdown for some time.” Unlike theatre-makers, artists depend on time apart. But it is possible lockdown might make artists focus in a new way. The deep emotional issues raised by this virus will infiltrate their minds as they have ours. What specifically are the emotional issues?MB: We’ve been going through a period of collective mourning because we took everyday social contact for granted – that sense of ourselves as human beings as part of a larger social whole. That’s been fundamentally challenged. We operated societally and individually as though we could overcome anything. We could fix things, cure things or pay to get ourselves out of difficult situations. None of those options has been open to us. Living with a sense of uncertainty is what people have been having to get used to. You can see they’re desperate for resolution: please tell us the answers. The truth is we don’t know how we are going to recover. Yet once we know we can reopen, I think we’ll definitely be ready. RN: Having been starved of live art, it’ll be like coming back to food you have been denied, there’ll be a great appetite for it. The crucial thing is to make sure we are there for audiences when that happens. The National Theatre is streaming productions for free on YouTube as part of National Theatre at Home (nationaltheatre.org.uk/nt-at-home)"
"Charlotte Higgins’ excellent article on the need to support the arts when the pandemic is over (After the war, the arts came back stronger. They can do so again now, 18 May) does contain one rather odd sentence near the end: “the war was the last time cultural organisations ground entirely to a halt”. Today we are unable to go to theatres or cinemas. During the war, the cinema was the staple entertainment (including the marvellous Pathé News), as was the theatre. It was the proud boast of the Windmill Theatre that, even during the blitz, “we never closed”. Perhaps the Windmill Theatre was not exactly a cultural organisation, though. I wouldn’t know: I used to wonder at the time exactly what it was. But the New Theatre and Playhouse in Oxford, where we were lucky enough to have no bombs, introduced me and many others to a lifelong love of the theatre."
"Art galleries and museums in NSW are scrambling to prepare for visitors again after being somewhat taken by surprise by Gladys Berejiklian’s announcement that they could reopen from 1 June.  The announcement, which came alongside an opening up of travel restrictions across the state, came sooner than expected for the gallery and museum sector, which on Tuesday was still waiting for the NSW government to provide clear protocols on how institutions could operate with social distancing.  Visitor numbers will be capped according to the 4msq-per-person rule. Movement through spaces will need to be tightly managed to prevent people pooling around exhibits. Group tours will not be permitted, and gallery and museum eateries will have to observe the same social distancing regulations that apply to cafes and restaurants outside. More detail was expected in the next 24 hours. Liz Ann Macgregor, director of Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art, received word of the premier’s announcement only a few hours before it was made. “It’s been pretty … interesting,” she said. “We knew there were discussions going on in government and so it wasn’t totally unexpected. The surprise was the timeframe and what we have to do to get there. “Will we be opening on June 1 or sometime after June 1? To be honest, I actually don’t know right now. My guess is that it’s unlikely we’ll be able to open before mid-June.” The MCA had already implemented social distancing protocols before its closure in March. MCA capacity will be limited to 500 people across all floors and spaces. “At least we’ve had a rehearsal of a sort, we have plans ready to roll,” Macgregor said, but she was reluctant to adopt pre-booking of viewing slots. “For us, it’s not the technology required, it’s the philosophy,” she said. “We’ve always operated on the idea that the doors are open anytime. We want office workers to pop in during their lunch break. But if the government instructs us to do timed tickets, then of course we will.” In the north of the state, the Lismore Regional Gallery is planning to reopen on 1 June with an exhibition devoted to the work of Queensland-based artist Ross Manning. However, if the Queensland border remains closed, Manning won’t be able to attend his own opening night. “We got the double whammy of regional tourism opening up and being able to reopen the gallery,” director Brett Adlington said. “But we are really waiting for the border to reopen so we can get the day-trippers from south-east Queensland. At least we are only 30 minutes from Byron Bay, so we’re hoping to attract people who are coming to the area to visit family they haven’t seen for weeks.” There is a lot of work to be done before then. Many regional galleries rely on volunteers, most of whom are older and may be vulnerable, Adlington said. “They are keen to come back because they love it. But we need to keep them safe. We will have Perspex sneeze guards at the front desks and we will remove all the floor sheets and brochures that people pick up to read about the artists and take home.” The art-making area for children will also have to go. “It would be impossible to keep that clean,” Adlington said. Some of Sydney’s big institutions are closed for renovation or relocation. MAAS/Powerhouse is unlikely to reopen at its current Pyrmont site. The Australian Museum is closed until November. Carriageworks recently went into voluntary administration. The National Maritime Museum plans to open from 15 June. Sydney Living Museums, including Hyde Park Barracks and Museum of Sydney, is still finalising reopening plans. In Western Sydney, the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre and Campbelltown Arts Centre are both ready to open from 1 June. The Art Gallery of New South Wales will also open on that date, its director, Michael Brand, said. The 22nd Biennale of Sydney: Nirin and the exhibitions Shadow Catchers and Under the Stars (which opened briefly before the gallery closed on 23 March) will reopen alongside a new exhibition, Some Mysterious Process, which Brand has curated during the shutdown. “The main goal is to make our visitors feel like they’re coming home,” Brand said. “It will be a little different. There will be timed ticketing to control the numbers of people in the building and we’re still working out the social distancing required – and there won’t be any cloaking. But the beauty of an art museum is that visitors tend to wander around the space and you can take multiple paths and directions. If you see three people standing in front of a painting, you can come back to that one. There is already some self-policing.” Esther Anatolitis, executive director of National Association for the Visual Arts, said it was exciting to imagine spaces reopening, but there was a lot of work to be done.  “Not every gallery has the capability to implement timed ticketing – but more importantly, that’s quite a significant shift away from the welcoming, inclusive spaces that galleries offer. “Visual art, craft and design spaces are freely open to everybody – there are no barriers. There needs to be good risk management in place, but for months now everybody’s been able to walk into a supermarket and touch anything they like without leaving their name at the door. So we need to be able to respond to public demand while applying safe practices that are consistent across industries.”"

"James Keast, who has died aged 63 of cancer, was one of British television’s most revered costume designers, who brought colour and style to period dramas, from The House of Eliott and Mr Selfridge to Victoria and Belgravia, but whose flair, imagination and technical skills were also used to great effect in contemporary series. For Luther (2010-19), he gave Idris Elba’s obsessive detective a distinctive coat and tie. “Putting Idris into a suit just makes him look like James Bond,” explained Keast. “I needed to find something that would show Idris’s shape, without making him look like a male model, hence the long coat.” Inspired by the Ukrainian photographer Boris Mikhailov, whose photographs are often monotone with a striking splash of primary colour, Keast added a red tie. “Without the tie, he’d almost blend into his gloomy surroundings.” For Peter Flannery’s epic nine-part drama Our Friends in the North (1996), Keast followed fashion from the 1960s right up to date in the story of four Newcastle friends’ lives and the politics and policing throughout that period. In Mr Selfridge (2013-16), a period drama set in the first two decades of the 20th century, he dressed Jeremy Piven, playing the department store entrepreneur, in the formal style of the time but added waistcoats and neckties to suggest his “showman” style. Meanwhile, Keast developed the look of Harry Selfridge’s lover, the showgirl-turned-serious actor Ellen Love (Zoe Tapper), from down-at-heel – with her clothes looking second-hand – to wealthier as she becomes the face of the London store. Other characters’ costumes conveyed their class differences, the affluent adorned in silks and satins, with detail such as lace flowers and beading, and shop assistants in wools, cottons and linen. Keast’s final project was this year’s series of Belgravia, written by Julian Fellowes, following his success with Downton Abbey. It stepped back to the very distinctive fashions of the early 19th century. “We start in 1815 and, as we go through the 20s and 30s, the waistline drops and the skirts get bigger,” explained Keast, who also added corsets and up to four heavy petticoats under each skirt. Tamsin Greig, as the middle-class matriarch Anne Trenchard, spoke of how each of Keast’s “incredible costumes told their own individual story” about the person and the place they found themselves in. Photography books and catalogues of paintings in art exhibitions were often part of his research – he recalled visits to the theatre as a child being like “looking at a live painting”. Then he made, hired or bought costumes, sometimes from vintage shops, though always aware of budgetary constraints. When he worked on the first three episodes of Victoria in 2016, his first challenge was to duplicate the coronation cloak to be worn by Jenna Coleman in her role as the new monarch. “If I’d had to have that embroidered, it would have cost me about £20,000,” said Keast, “so I found somebody that would photograph and laser-print the images on the fabric. Then, I found another person that could, with a machine, embroider over the top of the laser-printed images to give a bit of 3D.” Keast’s love for the screen was ignited by watching late-night horror movies on TV as a child. He was born in Armadale, West Lothian, to Eileen (nee McGuinness) and Joseph Keast, a civil servant, and attended St Mary’s academy, Bathgate. His ambition to be a painter led him to Edinburgh School of Art, but his interest turned to costume design and after graduating he joined the costumiers Berman’s and Nathan’s, in London, making and fitting garments as a costume assistant on films such as Death on the Nile (1978), Clash of the Titans (1981) and Victor Victoria (1982). Then he joined the BBC on a trainee scheme, first working as a costume designer on the 1987 series of Bergerac. He followed this with the BBC film Truly, Madly, Deeply (1990) and the second run of the 1920s dressmaking saga The House of Eliott, in 1992. Keast’s first success after turning freelance came with the writer Jimmy McGovern’s bitingly topical ITV drama-documentary Hillsborough (1996), about the football stadium disaster. The range of his work in television was demonstrated by his ability to hop between different eras. From 18th- and 19th-century costume dramas such as Aristocrats (1999), about the Duke of Richmond’s four daughters, he went to adaptations of early-20th-century novels, including Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World (2001) and John Buchan’s The 39 Steps (2008), and on to two biopics about recent television history, The Curse of Steptoe (2008), reflecting on a classic sitcom, and Hughie Green, Most Sincerely (2008), about the philandering quiz-show host. Keast won best costume design awards from Bafta for the gangland drama The Long Firm (2004) and the Royal Television Society for the director Peter Kosminsky’s TV film Warriors (1999), about UN peacekeepers struggling to return to civilian life in the 1990s after seeing the horrors of ethnic cleansing. Desperate Romantics (2009), a tale of the 19th-century Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood artists, was among five other productions to earn him Bafta nominations. He was put to the test in an unexpected way when, during the filming of Tess of the d’Urbervilles (2009) for the BBC, a fire destroyed the principal costume truck, containing 750 garments worth £320,000 and his own prized collection of period jewellery, including cufflinks that had belonged to Laurence Olivier. He sourced new fabric and had costumes re-made within 24 hours. Keast is survived by Rodney Gibson, his partner of 37 years, and his seven brothers and three sisters."
"At primary school, I had an incredible time learning incredibly little. Lessons were wild, teachers were sport and I made friends who have lasted me until middle age. For most of my life, I’ve considered these not only memories but principles: more than anything, children need to be happy, and there’s plenty of time for serious stuff later on. But then my daughter went into reception and – amazingly – I began to swither, theorising that she is not me, so her circumstances are different from mine. And then coronavirus appointed me headmaster of Harris homeschool and – amazingly – I became absolutely certain, announcing that things needed achieving. Following discussion with the chairman of the governors, formerly known as my wife, non-essential subjects were quickly binned to focus on skills, rather than information, alongside a bespoke programme of enrichment studies, ie, liking the stuff we like. Meanwhile, I furnished myself with a new suite of parental neuroses: how do I bestow the benefit of a one-on-one education from someone existentially invested in the outcome, while maintaining a father-daughter dynamic, while assuming a new role of best friend, while ensuring demarcation between home and school, while not being an overbearing moron at a time of intense stress such as to cause permanent psychological damage? This is a rhetorical question, not because everyone knows the answer but because there is no answer. All of which is a long-winded way of saying that what I’m really watching is not a lot. By the end of each day I’m so drained and occasionally elated that I offer even less resistance than usual to my boss’s Real Housewives imposition, every minute of which was justified the moment Porsha congratulated Eva for the “social distancing” performed by her “titties”. In the end we opted to omit that from the curriculum, but as part of tutoring my daughter in the ways of righteousness I decided that we should watch Dark Towers – made in 1981 as part of the BBC’s Look and Read series. If you went to school in the UK, you’ll likely be familiar with the genre: a story is told over the course of a few weeks, around which language and grammar are taught by presenters in outfits running the full spectrum of beige to brown, and who look 64 but are in fact 23. If Dark Towers was one of yours, you’ll definitely remember its magnificent theme tune and almost definitely remember an accordant nightmare epidemic – which stopped our class watching the final few episodes. Though I wasn’t one of those who let on, I’d be lying if I made out I was revisiting some childhood happy place. But Dark Towers was was one of the first stories to incite in me a visceral reaction, and if parenting is about preparing kids for the world, then squashing anxiety and maintaining perspective are handy things for them to know. I wondered whether the experience would be diluted by watching on a normal telly rather than a tardis on stilts that required a physics degree to operate. But the show shifted medium seamlessly, and its epic, sprawling, soaring introduction remains just brilliant as I remembered – though now I’m desperate for a Tenaglia remix. I must confess, though, that I’d half-forgotten about Wordy, an orange floating-head droid with letter zits. He and the presenter – clad in head-to-toe ginger, a phenomenal turn-up for the books – use the library they’re in, along with a collection of songs from the legendary Geordie Racer, to inculcate a love of words, wordplay, books and expression. I conceal my smirk when the “Magic E” ditty comes on, but the purity of it all is actually quite moving. But centrepiece of the show is the story – written by Andrew Davies who, though he never again scaled such lofty heights, went on to enjoy a fairly decent career. And what an opening he delivers here! “Tracy was a loner,” a voiceover intones. “She thought boys were daft … and she thought girls were daft!” Where to go after that? Well, “I like books better than people” – offered by Lord Edward Dark, the young heir to the eponymous edifice – isn’t a bad effort, and his relationship with Tracy offers a classic oddballs-make-friends subplot. But the principal narrative follows their bid to save the crumbling towers from the various crooks – one played by a youthful Christopher Biggins – who are after its treasure. To this end, they are helped by various supernatural happenings: “Would you be scared if you saw a ghost?” asks the voiceover in episode four, sweeping up any kids still unpetrified.  On this basis, my daughter eventually decided that Dark Towers wasn’t for her. I deployed my usual it’s only a story shtick, as well as reminding her to face fear and persevere. But she would have none of it and, as the plot progressed, I began to re-evaluate my own advice. “Girls were not like you in my day”, the friendly ghost tells Tracy condescendingly; “You read far too many books,” Edward’s dad chides him; “I don’t trust anyone,” Bunce surmises. Which is to say that the switched on, pleasant characters are kids and the ignorant, stubborn, mendacious fuckwits are adults. It’s a weird thing, being an adult, and an even weirder thing being a parent. You assume authority for shaping another person, then through example and indoctrination encourage them to be like you when sometimes even you don’t want to be like you. The pressure is awesome, the love overwhelming and the scope for error daunting. Whatever goes right feels like nature and whatever goes wrong feels like nurture. All of this is exacerbated by lockdown, the claustrophobic sameness magnifying feelings and multiplying flashpoints, with each day raising new versions of the same essential quandaries: take joy wherever you find it … but 17 biscuits and eight telly hours might be excessive. Unusual times provoke unusual behaviours … but new bad habits mustn’t ingrain; leniency is key at such a difficult time … but WHY YOU LITTLE! It’s a lot. So, though I started Dark Towers to close a door from my own childhood, it resonated with me because of the one currently in progress, for which I am responsible. Watching it, I was reassured that sometimes kids know what’s best for them, and the joy of seeing them think, emote and express is a strong one – even when you’d prefer them to just do what you say. What my daughter needs is not necessarily what I needed, and the one thing of which I can be sure is that the world does not require another me. Only Bond villains seek to clone themselves. Very clearly, the parents in Dark Towers are failing at their principal job – raising happy children – which, in a pandemic, is a parent’s only job. If you teach them stuff, that’s great, but if you teach them to love being alive, that’s enough."
"Progress made in the representation and inclusion of disabled artists and audiences is in danger of unravelling because of the pandemic, campaigners have warned. A new alliance of disabled people and groups working in the UK’s cultural industries, #WeShallNotBeRemoved, has been established to make sure disabled voices are heard as the nation’s devastated arts sector attempts to rebuild after the lockdown. Jenny Sealey, the artistic director of Graeae theatre in east London, said the pandemic had exposed real inequalities in theatre “by the million and one Zooms set up within our industry and the noticeable lack of deaf and disabled voices and black, Asian and ethnically diverse people in the mix”. She added: “As our community will be the last to come out of lockdown, the fear is by then we will be forgotten as artists and audience.” Campaigners say the lockdown has magnified inequalities for disabled people in the creative industries, with many disabled artists facing long-term shielding, loss of income and invisibility in wider society. The lockdown came when many were beginning to feel real change had finally arrived. Andrew Miller, the government’s first disability champion for arts and culture, pointed to the casting of Amy Trigg, who uses a wheelchair, in RSC productions and the then imminent opening at the National Theatre of Francesca Martinez’s play All of Us, which explores being disabled during a time of austerity. “There was a real sense of ‘hey, we’re going somewhere … we’re finally being included’. There was a real sense of progress. It wasn’t perfect. There was a a lot still to do. But there was a sense disabled people were becoming part of the fabric of arts and culture.” Sealey said the progress had been “frustrating and unnecessarily slow … It has taken the best part of 40 years for deaf and disabled people to be seen as a force to be reckoned with.” Then lockdown happened and prompted genuine concern that progress might unravel. Sealey said the drive to reopen theatres was “extremely ableist and non-diverse” in its approach. She added: “I am seriously concerned that we will be deemed too expensive, with companies no longer being able to cover the cost of access and that our work is too risqué and the theatre world wants post-pandemic nice, safe theatre.” Campaigners on Wednesday staged a social media action day, flooding Twitter, Facebook and Instagram with disabled voices. It included artists sharing their work online. The musician and campaigner John Kelly said: “We want to demonstrate solidarity and support for disabled people who are facing a very challenging future because of the pandemic by sharing the rich tapestry of our artworks to raise our voice, of our talent and our resilience.” Miller hopes arts leaders will seize on the opportunities offered by having to rebuild an entire industry. “It is a real opportunity to reset the longstanding discriminatory access issues in arts and culture,” he said."
"Despite Trump’s declaration Monday that the US has “prevailed” over coronavirus, infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned Congress in a televised hearing on Tuesday that reopening the country too soon would lead to “needless suffering and death”, which “I think is Trump’s new campaign slogan,” said Jimmy Kimmel. “Fauci and Trump seem to have opposite views of how to handle this – Trump says ‘we have prevailed!’ on the same day everyone at the White House was required to wear a mask,” he added. “So I guess it just comes down to who you believe: the doctor who’s one of the world’s leading experts on infectious disease, or our personal pan-president.” To convey the stakes of reopening the country too soon – which, Fauci warned, could also hamper economic recovery – Kimmel used the metaphor of a scab, “a big, black scab on our nation’s face. It’s not pretty; in fact, it’s ugly. It’s doing an important job – it’s healing and containing the wound. The best thing you can do with a scab is be patient and let it fall off. Unfortunately, there are some impatient people who want to dig their tiny orange fingernails into the scab and rip it off early and eat it. “And while that would feel good for like a second, if you rip off the scab and the wound is still bleeding under there, you have to start all over again with a new scab,” Kimmel said. “So what Dr Fauci is saying is the same thing your mother said: don’t pick the scab.” Meanwhile, leadership at Fox News, “the little engine behind the back to work movement”, according to Kimmel, decided to keep their New York offices closed through at least 15 June. “Isn’t that something? Fox News, the ones who are making fun of people cowering at home, is advising its employees to stay home,” said Kimmel. “Because apparently, they don’t get their news from Fox News.” Finally, Kimmel touched on Trump’s new distraction technique of “Obamagate”, a vague, made-up scandal he has propagated since Yahoo News leaked remarks by the former president criticizing Trump’s response to the coronavirus as a chaotic disaster. In an interview with Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, called Obama’s critique of the administration “classless”. “Wait … Obama is classless?” exclaimed Kimmel. “He’s joking – of all the wildly hypocritical things anyone has ever said about anything during this ordeal, the idea that Obama is classless and shouldn’t say bad things about another president – that might take the cake.” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also addressed Trump’s made-up “Obamagate” conspiracy theory – or, at least, tried to discern what it’s supposed to be about. On Monday, when asked to explain by a reporter, Trump responded: “You know what the crime is, the crime is very obvious to everybody, all you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.” “OK, that’s just weird – according to Trump, Obama committed the worst political crime in American history,” Noah said, quoting Trump’s words on Twitter, “but Trump won’t tell us what the crime is. Because it’s so obvious that you don’t even need to ask … even though everyone needs to ask. “Trump is treating Obama less like a criminal and more like they’re in a relationship and Trump feels like Obama messed up,” Noah added, breaking out his Trump impersonation: “If you don’t know what you did wrong, well I’m not going to tell you.” “So we have no idea what Obamagate actually is supposed to be,” Noah concluded. “And I don’t think Trump actually knows either. In fact, I think the only lesson Trump learned from Watergate is that things he doesn’t like should have the word “-gate” after it – Obama-gate, salad-gate, Eric-gate.” “Listening to health experts testify today, you might feel like we’ve got a long battle ahead of us,” said Stephen Colbert of Fauci’s virtual testimony before the Senate on Tuesday, “but according to the president, we’ve already won.” On Monday, Trump said in a White House briefing that America has “met the moment and we have prevailed” despite rising coronavirus cases across the country and Fauci’s warning that opening the US too soon would lead to “needless suffering and death”. “Look, I think our country is gonna pull through this, but that seems a little premature,” said Colbert of Trump’s proclamation. “It’s like passing out cigars on your first date, yelling: ‘it’s a boy!’” Trump, pressed by a reporter, clarified that he meant America has “prevailed on testing”. “Oh, we’re prevailing on something we needed to do months ago,” Colbert deadpanned. “I think his propaganda banner might need a slight change: ‘America leads the world in testing – but not for everyone, terms and conditions apply, side-effects may include no testing.”"

"Were she another kind of person, Jameela Jamil would have an easy life. Everything seemed to be going her way. First came the break that led to a job presenting Channel 4’s Saturday morning hangover slot, T4, which was followed by a job on Radio 1, before a swift, and unexpected, move to become an actor on the hit US sitcom The Good Place. Yet barely a month goes by without Jamil popping up to ignite some controversy or inflame the kind of commentator incensed by any hint of perceived “wokeness”. February was a particularly difficult month. First, she came out as queer, which appeared to infuriate many people. Then she had to defend herself against accusations she had Munchausen’s syndrome – a psychiatric disorder in which people feign illness – an allegation started by a writer who didn’t believe her history of health problems. She ended the month embroiled in a Twitter row with Piers Morgan (public feuds being something of a natural stomping ground for both) after the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack. Does Jamil ever feel like living a quieter life? “It’s not an easy path,” she says. “You get hurled up on to a pedestal and it always feels a bit like a trap – it’s very high, it’s easy to slip off and it’s a long way down. I’m just learning, I’m not the authority on anything.” She has not, she says, “handled myself perfectly at all times, but I am a human, prone to error”. We talk on the phone, with Jamil calling from her home in Los Angeles, which she shares with her boyfriend, the musician James Blake and three friends. The lockdown has not been too difficult, she says. “I couldn’t feel more privileged right now. I’m safe, I have a house. I can afford to not work for a while and I have my health,” she says. “On a more frivolous note, I’m really happy that handshaking is kind of cancelled for ever.” It has always appalled her, she says, and her explanation is something I have never considered before and will never be able to forget. “The fact you know that a hand has been on a dick at some point before touching your hand is deeply unsettling,” she says with a laugh, going on to describe it as “a sort of penile imprint upon your palm”. She has always succumbed to polite convention when someone puts their hand out. “Never again.” She is excited, too, about the possible return of women’s body hair, saying that “we’re coming out of this furrier, chubbier, spottier and hopefully alive. And that’s great – we are the lucky ones.” Might it mark the end of the ridiculous grooming ideals (the lip fillers, the weirdly immaculate eyebrows)? “For women who have transitioned, I think not having access to aestheticians is really difficult. But I think some women are becoming used to seeing their faces without makeup, and realising that you don’t need all of the nonsense that we have flogged at us.” Mostly she hopes that “our value systems are going to shift. Celebrities have been hero-worshipped, and now it has become very obvious who the true heroes are. And I think celebrities are consistently making arses of themselves.” I would be happy never to see a certain kind of influencer again, I say. “Who is going to have the money for cellulite cream, fillers or detox teas? No one’s going to want to see your $300 bikini any more. The way that we have looked up to money, fame and materialism …” She pauses. “I think that’s gone overnight because we don’t have the luxury any more. We’re talking about life or death. This is a depression. [Celebrities] need to shut up and open their purses.” (Jamil is donating to refugee and domestic violence charities.) She has a new podcast, which started at the beginning of the month, and she will soon launch a YouTube show. (“Is there anything sadder than a 34-year-old trying to start a YouTube channel?” she laughs.) Both come under her I Weigh movement, a campaign that started on Instagram in 2018 to promote the idea that people, especially women, should be “weighed” by their achievements rather than the number on their bathroom scales – and to promote inclusivity, social justice and mental health.  The latest episode of the podcast features Reese Witherspoon talking about postnatal depression and her experience of sexism in the entertainment industry. Future interviews will be with the writer Roxane Gay, Gloria Steinem and the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke. It is a sign of Jamil’s influence that she simply made a wishlist of people she wanted to interview, and they said yes. “I got creepy in the DMs [direct messages],” she says with a laugh. “I have absolutely no shame, and it’s great that the podcast is about ridding yourself of shame. This is also a podcast that is supposed to offer hope. We’re showing someone’s journey from the darkness towards the light.” If her guests seem to open up, it is probably because Jamil herself is incredibly candid. In the episode with Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general of the US and author of Together, a book about loneliness, Jamil talks about trying to kill herself at 26. In other episodes, she talks about the eating disorder she had as a teenager. It is almost easy to see why the conspiracy theory that she has Munchausen’s syndrome took off; she has been through so much, almost too much for one person. She attended an independent girls’ school in London (on a scholarship; she and her brother were mostly brought up by their mother, a school secretary) where she says she was the victim of racist bullying that was physical and violent. She was abused as a child, and was later the victim of several sexual assaults. She has said she is a multiple rape victim. At 17, she was hit by a car, severely damaging her spine, and spent more than a year recovering. Mental illness led to the attempt to kill herself in her mid-20s, at which point she sought therapy. She also went through several painful operations as a child to deal with hearing loss, and has coeliac disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects the body’s connective tissues. In revealing so much about herself, she – unwittingly or not – places herself at the centre of many experiences. She may say, not unreasonably, that being so open reduces stigma, but it can also look like attention-seeking and self-promotion. This appeared to be what prompted the backlash when Jamil came out as queer. She had been criticised on social media for her appointment as a judge on Legendary, a TV competition inspired by black LGBT ballroom and vogueing culture. To all appearances, Jamil was a heterosexual cis woman who had been in a relationship with a man for five years. Jamil is not interested in justifying herself or how she identifies. (“Staying away from that question,” she says good-naturedly when I bring it up.) But was she surprised by the reaction? “No, I understood, because of the timing. I was never trying to divert from [the criticism]. I was just trying to add to the conversation; that I’m not saying this qualifies me as a part of ballroom [culture], but you don’t actually know my sexuality.” She had not come out before “because I was worried that people would think I was jumping on a trendy bandwagon. And various other reasons. So I understand the pushback.” What she didn’t understand, she says, were the claims she was a liar. “What a weird lie,” she says with a laugh. “It doesn’t help to identify yourself in any way in an industry that still discriminates against people. But the rest of it, I understood. That’s why I didn’t come back complaining.” The same criticisms around appropriation have surrounded Jamil’s campaigning on body image when she herself is slim and conventionally beautiful. She has been accused of shaming other women – most damagingly black women, such as the rapper CupcakKe (after the entertainer announced she had been on a 40-day “water fast”) without acknowledging that the policing of black women’s bodies comes with its own painful history. There have also been accusations she has adopted the words and ideas of others, such as the writer Stephanie Yeboah. Her brand of feminism has been described as “exclusionary … and toxic” by the writer Danielle Dash. Jamil has always said she is constantly learning, and readily admits to her own mistakes and gaps in her knowledge. (In October, for instance, she explained she knew little about George W Bush’s presidency after being embroiled in another Twitter row.) Using her platform, particularly as one of the most high-profile women of south Asian heritage in the western media, puts her in a tricky position. Does she speak out about airbrushing and start feuds with the Kardashians over the diet products they promote – and risk making mistakes – or keep quiet? “I’ve asked repeatedly for magazines to put me on the cover with women of different body shapes, and with disabilities, and they say no. So either no one has the conversation or I do the photoshoot by myself because then at least the conversation gets had.” People have been impatient, she says; her YouTube show will provide a platform for other activists. “You have to take hold of the mic first before you can pass it,” she says. Jamil is so divisive, seemingly equally championed by those who like her openness and sense of humour (she is not an earnest sort of activist), and vilified by those who think she is endlessly virtue-signalling for her own gain. Blake sometimes steps in. (After the Munchausen’s rumour went viral, he posted: “It’s pretty disgusting to watch the woman I love just be dog piled on every day.”) Would she rather he didn’t? She laughs. “I don’t want it to impair his career in any way just because I’m in a controversy. But it must be difficult to see people hurt someone you love. I’m very lucky to have someone this diehard in my corner.” She says she is “absolutely fine” dealing with the fallout if she feels in the wrong. “It’s when it’s a lie, a smear campaign – that doesn’t sit well with me because that’s the technique of discredit. We make [women] sound crazy and unhinged, and we try to devalue their word and their work.” There must be days, I say, when it gets too much. “I’d say the Munchausen’s thing. The Caroline Flack thing really upset me because we were on good terms.” They had not really spoken “just because of what had been going on”, says Jamil (in October, Jamil had criticised a cosmetic surgery show Flack would be presenting). “She reached out to me with a message of such love, and she passed away that week.” The next week, Piers Morgan posted text messages from Flack on Twitter, sent to him last year saying she was “struggling” with Jamil, “as if I was any contribution to her passing, when I’d never instigated any kind of argument with Caroline. I don’t criticise the host, I criticise the show.” She says she didn’t publish Flack’s last message to her “because I’m not a scumbag”. Ultimately, she says, she will not shut up. Outspoken women, and especially outspoken women of colour, are disproportionately attacked online. “That isn’t just about the woman they are vilifying,” says Jamil. “It’s also a deliberate message they are sending out to all other women to not speak out, to not stand for something, to not break the rules. And that’s why I can’t back down now, because otherwise it would say that it wasn’t worth it and that I shouldn’t have stuck my neck out.” The car accident partly explains her resilience. “Having a near-death experience gives you a strong perspective,” she says. “Being dragged on Twitter or being embarrassed on television – or rejection – nothing scares me any more. So I think it made me very bold.” She was also inspired by Yes Man, the memoir by Danny Wallace in which he spent a year saying “yes”. It partly explains her decision to move to the US and dare to audition for The Good Place, having never acted before. “I am definitely more surprised [at my career] than any of you could ever be.” But it was her breakdown in her mid-20s that became the bigger pivotal moment. “After that, I realised it was very much do or die, and I had to investigate everything that had led me to such a low point,” she says. “One of those things was shame. You place the blame upon yourself, especially when you’re very young. But also just shame for being a woman. You’re too skinny, you’re too fat, you’re not smart enough or you’re too smart. I completely accept my own fuck-ups, but a lot of things that have caused a lot of trauma are not my fault.” That’s why she does what she does, she says – the social-media posts that sometimes strike the wrong note, the fights, the campaigns. “Important conversations feel uncomfortable. And therefore we leave young people unarmed.” She would like to work on syllabuses for schools “so that we don’t learn more about igneous rock than we learn about consent, eating disorders and the lies of social media”. What next for Jamil? She has built up a large social-media following and something of a power base. If it is to further her acting career, constantly criticising many aspects of the entertainment industry would be a funny way of going about it. So no nice, easy life for her. “I would do certain things differently,” she says. “I would rather start the fights that I start and sometimes get into the trouble that I get into than sit here silently and be complicit in an industry that pumps so much toxicity into the world.” She understands some people’s wariness of her, she says. “I look like the enemy. I’m a slim, privileged person who exists within this industry; I totally get the mistrust. I will just have to do the work to prove I wasn’t such a shitbag after all. I’m not doing this for popularity. I’m doing this so that I can undo the stuff that I saw when I was younger, that made me unwell, and try to change it.” There is a smile in her voice as she says: “And sometimes you have to be annoying and attention-seeking in order to instigate that change.”  Jameela Jamil’s I Weigh podcast is hosted at www.earwolf.com  In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

"We’re not the only ones in lockdown. While the pandemic continues, millions of objects in UK museums – a dizzying array of treasures and oddities – are shut away behind closed doors, visible only to staff. In last week’s Observer, to remind readers of some of the items gathering dust at London’s Victoria & Albert Museum, we asked its director Tristram Hunt to highlight 10 of his favourite artefacts from the collection (his choices included a Rodin bronze and Grayson Perry’s Brexit vases). This week we’ve gone countrywide, asking the directors of five museums outside London to each choose two favourite items that represent their institution or region.  “The reason that we exist is to care for the collections and make them accessible, so the fact that we’re not able to open the doors and let people see the collections is really heart-breaking,” says Kathryn Thomson, director of National Museums of Northern Ireland.Directors are rethinking their roles. “We are looking at different ways to tell stories,” says Caroline McDonald, manager of the Great North Museum, Hancock, in Newcastle.  Raven Transformation Mask by Haida chief and master carver Charles Edenshaw, 1880 This very striking object is considered to be one of the greatest works of art ever made by the Haida people of western Canada. Raven is an important being in Haida culture, a powerful and mischievous creative force who features in many stories and whose transformation is acted out in dances with the help of masks like this. The renowned Haida artist Gwaai Edenshaw was meant to come to Oxford this year to work with teenagers from local schools in a collaboration with the Oxford company Flintlock Theatre. Witch in a bottle, collected in Hove, Sussex in 1915 “Witch bottles” were seen as magical tools to protect against evil. This glass bottle was collected by a prominent female scholar in an otherwise male-dominated academy named Margaret Murray. It is said that the old lady it was obtained from warned: “They do say there be a witch in it, and if you let un out there’ll be a peck o’trouble”. At the beginning of the pandemic, we had people jokingly ask whether we had maybe let “un” out? We reassured everyone we had not. German armour, 1500-10 We have an amazing collection of arms and armour, including a very decorative suit belonging to the Earl of Pembroke, but this plainer suit of armour, which would have been worn by a mercenary soldier, affects me much more. The helmet reminds me of Robocop, rounded with very narrow eye slits. The design is quite simple but brutally effective. You see a guy coming at you with this on, and you’re going to turn and run. It makes you remember how horrible war has always been and always will be. Spitfire, 1946 Spitfires have an emotional connection for most British people – it’s seen as the plane that saved us in the Second World War – but this one was actually built after the war in 1946, for the City of Glasgow squadron. As a museum item, it comes with its practical challenges: it’s a four-ton object that we’ve got suspended from the ceiling, and every 10 years it has to come down for conservation work, which is a bit of a pain. But it’s a great thing to have. Endangered harlequin frog, Panama This is not an artefact as such: it’s alive and kicking. Harlequin frogs are from a remote indigenous rainforest community in Panama. They are beautiful and very small, not that much bigger than your thumbnail. The only place you can see them outside Panama, where they are on the brink of extinction, is in our vivarium. Manchu headdress (dian zi), China Dian zi translates as “hat ring”, an accessory worn by noble Manchu women at weddings, festivals and birthdays – all the things I wish I was attending now. This is a beautiful example from the 19th century, so richly decorated. It’s made of thin rattan strips woven into a check pattern and hung with gemstones, pearls, coral and enamel work. The extraordinary blue colour comes from inlaid kingfisher feathers, which when they catch the light are heartstoppingly beautiful. Derry Girls blackboard This is the much-celebrated “differences” blackboard from Channel 4’s Derry Girls, from the episode in season two where the girls go on a cross-community trip with a Protestant school. The episode created a huge amount of conversation and, though it’s dealing with difficult subject matter, people were able to have a laugh at it. You can take the Derry Girls test to find out how Catholic or Protestant you are. It’s light-hearted and playful, while also challenging stereotypes and showing that, really, we’re not all that different. Bomb disposal robot Prior to 1972, explosive devices could only be disarmed by hand. Then disposal experts started to use an instrument codenamed “Pigstick”, which shot a burst of water into the rigged explosive that caused the circuitry to malfunction. Then a retired lieutenant-colonel, Peter Miller, developed a robot that used a similar technique. From 1972 to 1978, 400 of these units were destroyed while dealing with explosive devices. This is part of our permanent exhibition, The Troubles and Beyond, at the Ulster Museum, and it’s a reflection of how far we’ve come as a society in Northern Ireland. Hadrian inscription This is really the Rosetta stone of the north – an incredibly important national object that perhaps gets overlooked because it has remained in the north. It’s an inscription from Hadrian’s Wall that was discovered near Milecastle 38 around 250 years ago, but it wasn’t until the mid-19th century that anyone understood its importance. There was a huge debate around who had built the wall, and this stone confirmed that it was Hadrian who kicked off this monumental building project. Struggle with the Quarry by John Hancock Taxidermy is often maligned, but this piece by the great local naturalist John Hancock – in whose honour our museum is named – is a fantastic work of art, made for the Great Exhibition of 1851. In the mid-Victorian era, there was a move away from the sense of nature as serene and pastoral. What Hancock is demonstrating in this piece, where a falcon fights a heron over an eel that’s slithering away, is that nature is vicious, cruel and hierarchical. It’s relevant now, because we see nature surging back."
"The Sydney Opera House has been approached to consult on the long-term viability of multi-arts precinct Carriageworks as reports emerge that the Berejiklian government is considering a proposal for the famous landmark’s trust to take over Carriageworks’ operations.  Carriageworks announced on Monday night that it was going into voluntary administration as a consequence of the “irreparable” effects of the coronavirus crisis and the widespread shutdown on its income stream. The move has been described as “devastating” by artistic directors, individual arts practitioners and state and federal politicians alike. The appointed administrators, Phil Quinlan and Morgan Kelly from KPMG, have remained tight-lipped on the size of the organisation’s debts and who its primary creditors are. But their public statement, which notes they will be “exploring the possibility of a deed of company arrangement to stabilise Carriageworks’ financial position and allow it to continue its important role for Australian arts and culture”, suggests that they will be looking for a bailout. Reports emerged on Tuesday night that the NSW government was considering a proposal to pass management of the space to the Opera House Trust. In a statement, an Opera House spokesperson said the trust “has been approached by the government to consult on the long-term sustainability of Carriageworks as an important cultural venue, particularly at this most difficult time”. But there have been widespread calls for the bailout to come from the NSW government itself, as pressure grows on state and federal governments to do more to assist the arts sector in recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. Labor’s Walt Secord, the shadow arts minister for NSW, called for an emergency rescue package for arts organisations from the state government at a press conference on Tuesday, saying there was “a role for the state government” in assisting Carriageworks’ recovery. Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, in an opinion piece for the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, also called for a state government bailout using the funds for the “incredibly unpopular and shortsighted” $1.5bn plan to relocate the Powerhouse Museum from its current home in Ultimo to the western Sydney suburb of Parramatta. “It’s beyond time the state and federal governments ended their abandonment of artists, performers and those administering the arts organisations. They are left with the impression their jobs are not ‘real’ jobs, not important to our country like, say, mining or professional football,” Moore said. The piece follows similar calls on Tuesday for a bailout using the Powerhouse relocation fund from Greens MP Cate Faehrmann. A complex of performance and gallery spaces in repurposed 1880s locomotive workshops in Sydney’s inner west, Carriageworks has been a mainstay of Sydney’s cultural life since it opened in 2007, pivoting in recent years from a venue for hire towards a more fully rounded artistic organisation with its own commissioning program. The options for the organisation now depend to a certain extent on what it owes, and to whom. Carriageworks’ most recent financial statements, filed to the charities regulator, show an income stream heavily reliant on a combination of events and government support. In 2018, the company made $3.95m of its $11.6m reported income from events and venue hire, not including its regular farmers markets, which brought in an additional $1.1m. Support from grant programs totalled $3.16m in the same year, the vast majority of which was core funding from Create NSW, to the tune of $2.53m. The vast majority of expenditure – $7.05m of $12.2m that year – went towards staff salaries and wages, and the costs of putting on an artistic program. Many of Carriageworks’ staff were stood down in early April and hours for core staff were substantially reduced as the Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions on mass gatherings rolled out and public programs shut down.The arts sector has been calling on state and federal governments for weeks to commit to greater support for the sector, which was one of the first to feel the effects of the ban on mass gatherings and lockdowns of non-essential businesses. Esther Anatolitis, executive director of the National Association for Visual Arts and a staunch advocate for the arts industry, said the sector had been “united and clear” on its needs and demands. “We need to make sure that eligibility for support measures changes immediately, so that creative practitioners and businesses can access what they need. We need the $111.7bn creative industries to be recognised as the massive economic driver Australia cannot afford to lose, and that means targeted stimulus now,” she told Guardian Australia. After Carriageworks’ announcement on Monday, those calls have been picked up by other politicians, with federal Labor’s Anthony Albanese and Tanya Plibersek calling for more federal support on Twitter. The NSW government has provided some Covid-19 relief for small-to-medium arts organisations, mainly through the repurposing of existing funds in Create NSW into quick-response grants, accommodation and small projects. But it is also currently without a designated arts minister – the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has been acting in the role herself since Don Harwin resigned his post in April after staying at his central coast holiday house over Easter in breach of a Covid-19 “stay home” public health order. She has, to date, made no announcements about further arts stimulus for NSW. Given the state government already provides a large proportion of Carriageworks’ core funding, any negotiations for a bailout will likely need to be accompanied by at least some private philanthropy. According to the organisation’s last annual report, its philanthropy and sponsorship income totalled only 7% of its income. The administrators are due to hold their first meeting with creditors on 14 May."
"On Late Night, Seth Meyers addressed the revelation this week that Donald Trump’s intelligence briefing book included coronavirus warnings throughout January and February. “While Trump was telling everyone it would disappear like a miracle and cases would soon go down to zero, he was getting private warnings that, actually, it was a big deal,” Meyers explained. “Which means either one of two things: he was lying, or he didn’t read it.” Both are probably true, because, as Meyers pointed out, “once Trump heard them refer to it as the novel coronavirus, he was never gonna read it, because he’s never gone near a novel. They should have told him it was called Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition coronavirus and he would’ve at least thumbed through it.” Additional reports confirmed that Trump regularly skips not only reading the briefing, but the oral summary delivered two to three times a week. “What do they have to do to keep this guy’s attention? Have his daily briefings delivered by pageant contestants?” asked Meyers, impersonating a chipper pageant girl: “My name is Brianna, I’m from Battle Creek, Michigan, and a new virus spreading across the globe has a 3.4% mortality rate!” But this tracks with what we know about Trump, Meyers concluded, and pointed to reports from early in Trump’s presidency that intelligence officials strategically placed his name, “killer graphics” such as photos and charts and tiny, and easily digestible “nuggets” of information in briefings to keep him reading. “He wants tiny nuggets! Killer graphics and to see his own name … so he wants a birthday party,” Meyers said. “He wants a child’s birthday party.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert acknowledged a grim milestone: as of Wednesday, America has more than 1 million coronavirus cases and more fatalities than the Vietnam war. “There’s no getting around it,” said Colbert. “It’s a solemn day – for everyone except presidential son-in-law and man watching you enjoy that lollipop Jared Kushner,” who on Wednesday described the federal government’s response to the virus as a “great success story” on Fox News. “Yes, it’s a great story – more people dying under this administration in 100 days than died in 20 years of the Vietnam war,” Colbert said in his snakiest Kushner impersonation. “That’s a story that need to be told, perhaps in the blockbuster movie Preventable Apocalypse Now.” Colbert also discussed Mike Pence’s visit to the Mayo Clinic this week, in which he defied policy and refused to wear a mask. “Finally, a medical explanation for why seeing Mike Pence’s face makes you feel ill,” Colbert deadpanned. Asked why he disregarded rules on Tuesday, the vice-president claimed that “since he didn’t have the coronavirus”, he figured not wearing a mask offered a “good opportunity” to “speak to these researchers, these incredible healthcare personnel, and look them in the eye and say thank you”. “You can still look them in the eye with a mask!” Colbert said. “It’s not a blindfold. Also, ‘I don’t have coronavirus’ isn’t an excuse for not protecting other people. That’s like a guy saying ‘I don’t need to wear a condom. I want to look you in the eye and say thank you.’” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee called attention to the US postal service, an essential, if often overlooked, institution in dire financial straits. It’s hard to get excited about the postal service, Bee admitted, but it’s “hot as hell … I mean the workers wear knee shorts, they give it to us in the rain, sleet and snow, and they’re the only federal agency built entirely around on the principle of licking stuff.” But without financial assistance from the government, it will run out of cash in June. Congressional Republicans rejected funding for the postal service in the latest stimulus bill, as Trump called it a “joke” and claimed it undercharges Amazon for its packages (his administration has debunked this) on account of his personal obsession with Jeff Bezos for owning the Washington Post. The postal service, crucial for mail-in voting, has seen volume drop by a third, more than 1,200 workers out with coronavirus and many more concerned about lack of basic supplies and protections on the job. Still, it’s “one of the only federal agencies directly authorized in the constitution, and it’s one of the most democratic institutions we have”, Bee explained. “But even if their voters like it, Republican leaders hate when the government actually works,” Bee added. “They’re been trying to undermine the postal service for decades, going back to 1982, when Ronald Reagan signed a law requiring NBC’s Thursday night lineup to feature at least one asshole mailman at all times.” In all seriousness, Republicans have in recent years tried to lower wages, reduce benefits and cut routes in an effort to privatize the service. “It’s ridiculous to expect the post office to be a money-making enterprise! It’s a public good,” Bee said. “Expecting the post office to turn a profit is like expecting public libraries to sell the right to use their bathroom.” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed food supply fears, as meat-processing plants across the country shut down due to coronavirus updates. Earlier this week, Trump signed an executive order under the Defense Production Act to keep some processing plants open and running at maximum capacity. “You know, I will say this about Trump: he is very clear about what his priorities are in life,” said Noah. “Because he was warned for months about the pandemic coming to America and he did practically nothing. But you tell the man once that there could be a beef shortage and he springs into action like the world’s hungriest superhero.” Still, few places in America have experienced higher rates of coronavirus than meat-processing plants. And “although there doesn’t seem to be a danger to the food itself, in most of these facilities, the workers are quite literally putting their lives on the line”. At many plants, several thousand employees work in close proximity; workers have alleged they were given hairnets to use as face masks. “It’s really sad that these workers are being forced to keep the food chain going but nobody is being forced to protect them while they do it,” Noah concluded. “They need equipment to keep safe while doing their jobs. And if you eat meat, you especially should want these workers to be treated right, because without them, the only way you’ll get your bacon is if you fight the pig yourself.”"
"An end to home schooling looks like it’s on the horizon in Australia, with many states now planning phased returns to classroom education. But the months of isolation and social distancing have seen parents and children drawing on deep reserves of creativity like never before.  For Sydney’s Simon Greiner, aka @TheCardboardDad on Instagram, isolation meant an escalation to his already impressive efforts to create a magical play world for his kids out of cardboard. Greiner started building his astonishing contraptions at the request of his four-year-old son. As each brief got filled, the next became more elaborate and specific – such as a “giant hand”, “a helicopter I can go in with a spinning propeller”, “a real castle I can go in with a drawbridge” or “a wrecking ball that lets me smash something down”. Soon they were coming in at an “alarming frequency”, Greiner says. “It’s a really nice way to play with my kids in a way that they really appreciate, and that I appreciate on a slightly different level,” Greiner says.  Greiner’s partner had already started hoarding cardboard before physical distancing was mandated (“there was a whole wad of it beneath the couch”), but an increase in deliveries due to the lockdowns compounded the collection. Old projects have to be surreptitiously recycled: Greiner says there is a “graveyard” of some of the bigger inventions on the family’s back porch – out of sight, out of mind until they become something else.  Anna Ryan-Punch and her 11-year-old son Luka have also been creating elaborate constructions with recyclables, though many of his projects have been set by his school inquiry class. They included building a machine of his choosing out of ordinary household bits and pieces. He designed and built a zipline out of a cup, some marbles, a bull clip and string.  “We had to raid and rinse out a lot of the recycling bin,” Ryan-Punch says. “It ended up being pretty hilarious, despite us both going, ‘Oh no we have to build another thing’.” Much more palatable to all involved were the cooking tasks, which required Luka to research something that interested him, draw a plan or recipe, and then follow it – with yields including scrambled eggs and chocolate chip cookies. Some parents, meanwhile, have been going off the map by necessity. For artist Lily Mae Martin and her nine-year-old daughter Anja, following the school curriculum at home hasn’t been a great success, so they started self-directed learning. Projects involved making paper dolls of the family together, using blocks to help Anja keep up with maths, and pulling apart an antique clock to study its mechanisms. Martin also painted a series of pictures of native animals at her daughter’s request so they could both learn more about them. “I think making kids feel safe and keeping their love of learning alive matters more at the moment,” Martin says.

"It’s been over six weeks of quarantine, and “like all of you, I’m sure, I’m just looking forward to the glorious day when this crisis is over and I can rip off my mask and go into a crowded room full of elderly people and lick them all,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. “And what gets me is that President Trump should’ve seen this Covid crisis coming.” Reports revealed this week that as far back as January, the president’s intelligence briefing book repeatedly cited the virus threat. “Well, there’s your problem!” said Colbert. “Those are three of Trump’s least favorite words: intelligence, briefing and book. If they really wanted him to pay attention, they should’ve called it his ‘Daily Pornographic Hamburger Firetruck’.” And on Monday, after scheduling, cancelling and rescheduling a press conference, Trump said he “can’t imagine why” people would heed his suggestion to drink bleach as a way to treat the coronavirus. “I can’t imagine why those people would follow your advice – it’s a real mystery,” Colbert deadpanned. “Specifically: ‘Nancy Drew and the Case of Bleach She Drank After Trump Told Her To.’” At the briefing, the Trump administration unveiled their “blueprint” to expand coronavirus testing capacity in the country, though it leaves the onus on states to develop their own plans. “So, their plan is: make someone else come up with the plan,” said Colbert, who noted that it literally calls the federal government the “supplier of last resort”. “Well, that is some inspiring leadership. Just like Braveheart: ‘They make take our lives, but they’ll never take our freedom! Anyway that’s the blueprint, good luck! I’m the fighter of last resort.’” In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also discussed the revelation that intelligence officials placed coronavirus warnings in Trump’s daily intelligence briefing book throughout January and February. “Book” was really the issue, Kimmel claimed. “The president doesn’t read books. If you wanted him to take it seriously, you should’ve tweeted him like a gif of a dancing cheeseburger.” In other news, Vice-President Mike Pence caused a stir on Monday when he toured the Mayo Clinic without a mask – the only one not to wear one on his tour, since the clinic has a strict mask-wearing policy. “You know the only reason he didn’t wear a mask is because Trump won’t wear one,” said Kimmel. “Mike Pence is required to keep his lips free at all times for kissing master’s ass.” After his visit, the Mayo Clinic tweeted: “Mayo Clinic informed [Pence] of the mask policy prior to his arrival today,” which was embarrassing, Kimmel said, although there might some logic to it: “I don’t know, maybe Mike Pence just wants to catch it already and be put out of his misery.” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah unpacked the issues with the government’s paycheck protection program (PPP), which set aside $342bn to help small businesses through the pandemic shutdown. A couple weeks ago, before most businesses could receive help, “that money disappeared faster than Rudy Giuliani in direct sunlight,” said Noah. Congress returned with a second round of $310bn, but still, the money did not get to the businesses, as the Small Business Administration website portal for loan applications crashed almost immediately after launch on Monday. But it’s not just computer issues: “it turns out that the reason small businesses haven’t been able to get their money, is because the big businesses have been snapping it up,” said Noah. In the first round of the funding, $810m went to large, publicly traded companies, some with market values of over $100m, including the national restaurant chain Shake Shack and the Los Angeles Lakers. “I don’t care what anybody says, the Lakers do not need $4m,” said Noah. “The Knicks need $4m to bribe their fans to act like they don’t see what’s going on.” “It’s important to remember that although what these big companies did was shitty, it wasn’t illegal,” Noah continued. “They saw a chance – a chance to get money – and they took it. Which is what companies are always gonna do.” Which raises the question: “why didn’t the government come up with regulations to make sure that the money for small businesses actually went to small businesses?” Instead of keeping the big dogs out, the treasury ceded authority to the banks, “and then the banks did what the banks do, which is: screw over the little guys”, said Noah. Already, a lawsuit against four major banks – Bank of America, US Bank, Chase and Well Fargo – alleges the banks prioritized bigger customers (with their bigger bank fees) over small businesses. The PPP situation proves “you can’t leave the loan decisions up to the banks,” Noah concluded, as banks are businesses – they’re “always going to take care of its top customers first”. Furthermore, many small businesses are owned by women and African Americans, who often lack pre-exisiting relationships with banks. “So, if the banks didn’t know you before coronavirus, you’re definitely not going to be on their radar now,” said Noah, which is why some experts have warned that up to 90% of minority and women-owned businesses will be shut out of the paycheck protection program. “I don’t know how you fix this program overnight,” Noah concluded, “but if you’re a woman or a minority who owns a small business, I suggest you start practicing your jump shot, because that might be the only way you get some of this government cash.”"
"Looking every inch the metal drummer he is, Nat (no surname) is an unlikely Vera Lynn for our times. And yet, the Sydney comedian’s no-nonsense cookery segments are bringing comfort to the masses. “What’s going on, Iso-Lords?” he says, introducing his latest clip, The Crowd Goes Mild Curry. “We’re back in the kitchen, saying no to jar sauce.” Behind a sparkling-clean counter laden with fresh vegetables, spices and herbs stands Nat: black band T-shirt, hair halfway down his torso, arms and neck covered in tattoos. He walks us through the ingredients before getting stuck into the methodology. “If you’ve got one of these cheeky bastards, use this. It’s called a microplane. I know it sounds like a small aircraft, but it’s just a pretentious name for a fine grater. If you don’t have one of these pratty things you can just use a normal grater, and if you don’t think you’ve got one of these, you’re wrong. You’ve got four of them and they’re buried behind the other three.” The Nat’s What I Reckon YouTube channel has been in operation for 10 years, with 85,000 subscribers to Nat’s ocker brand of social commentary, rife with wordplay and colourful metaphors. Now he’s taken off to an even wider audience with recipes that wage war on processed food, like his End of Days Bolognese. Each video has clocked up around 5m views so far, and won him fans in the Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl, DJ Carl Cox and the actor Yael Stone. Sitting in a cluttered Sydney office on a Skype call with Guardian Australia, Nat apologies for being ineloquent. He doesn’t mean the fact that his dialogue is always peppered with swearing and mumbling, but the fact he’s trying to be helpful while struggling with fatigue. He works full-time on the clips with his girlfriend – he edits and answers messages, she films and designs – and says he’s not sleeping much from fielding business inquiries. “It’s just a fucking tidal wave at the moment,” he says, looking dazed. “It’s hard to remember anything.” Nat got the idea to diversify into cooking segments after the lockdown cancellation of what would have been his first live comedy tour (“heartbreaking”), but his own health kick was also an impetus. In earlier material, he’d wander around trade shows and art happenings with a mic, a perplexed attitude and what looked like a well-tended beer gut. “I’ve lost about 24 kilos,” he says. “I had one of my lungs removed a while ago and put on a bit of weight because I was pretty sick. Going to the gym wasn’t doing anything and the gut wasn’t helping my breathing, so I started looking into what food I was eating.” What better time to turn that knowledge into a public service than during the panic-buying of jar sauce and packet soup? “There’s a fresh food section in the supermarket that hasn’t been touched and yet empty shelves of pasta sauce,” he says. “You’re fucking stuck at home – what are you doing? Eat better.” Other Australian YouTube-reared comedians have covered the coronavirus pandemic in styles verging from satirical to political, such as Sooshi Mango, Alex Williamson and Jordan Shanks, but there’s something weirdly comforting – benevolent, even – about Nat’s grouchy big-brother style. Maybe it’s his “settle down” tone (even if he’s actually arguing about the fact we shouldn’t be putting zucchini in spag bol), or the fact he avoids shaming people, other than the odd “make sure you wash your fucking hands, you grubs”. “Sometimes parents remake my videos with their kids and send them to me,” he says. “It’s pretty unreal that kids are digging it. I’m not going to judge your parenting.” Damo is a Sydney-based chef (and a friend of mine) who watches Nat’s videos with his 11-year-old and nine-year-old, who’ve started spinning and whistling, Nat-style. “He hit a chord with us because he feels familiar and we think we’d enjoy hanging out with him,” says Damo. He’s not surprised to hear that Nat’s dad was a chef who taught his son to cook. “He knows what he’s doing in the kitchen – I assumed that he was trained because he knows how to use a knife. “One other thing that made me admire him is that during one video he said something like, ‘Just have a go, you’re more talented than you realise.’ I thought, this guy’s genuine, that’s a really nice thing to prop people up with. Then I found his videos on depression and anxiety, and I gained shitloads of respect for him.” Damo’s talking about one of Nat’s segments called Is It Sh*t?, in which he once reviewed his own anxiety, and the comedian was also an ambassador for The Big Anxiety festival from the University of New South Wales in 2019. His current bio describes his work as “holding up a mirror to masculine culture”, though I can’t help wondering if he’s retrofitted that, since he surely started out just recording whatever made his mates laugh. “I’ve always made fun of that narrow-minded boofhead thing,” Nat says, not taking offence. “The trade-show reviews I did were all about sticking it to boys’ clubs. Boats, burnouts, that kind of shit.” That’s true; as well as his review of “massive money hoon” the Sydney Boat Show, which was the turning point for his popularity, he’s affectionately lampooned revhead events such as Canberra’s Summernats. Not using his surname saves him some grief from the dedicated car crowd. So far, Nat’s What I Reckon has mostly been monetised through a merchandising line. The comedian avoids the sponsorship deals that are rife among social media figures, “given that the whole point is it’s me and what I reckon”. Still, it’s likely that international touring, once restrictions lift, will fill the coffers – though Nat can’t figure out how his hefty American fanbase can even understand him. For now, his Australian tour has been rescheduled for September, and it’s nearly all sold out. Broader than standup, which he’s done for a couple of years, it will draw on multimedia and interactive crowd skits, and he’s turned his anxiety into a game show. All that’s missing is a set from one of his bands, Penalties or Keggerdeth. “[Until then] I’m going to keep doing what I’m doing, smashing out videos, because it seems to be working,” he says. “The plan is to keep my hands on the wheel and hang on for dear life.”"
"Derry Girls has been critically acclaimed (the first season holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and smashed ratings records in Ireland and the UK, but despite international distribution via Netflix it’s remained criminally under-watched – at least based on my metric of asking everyone I know if they’ve watched the show and being disappointed by the answers. Here’s the pitch I use to try to convince people to give it a go: “Imagine a show like The Inbetweeners but funnier, with a heartwarming and realistic portrayal of female friendship, that tackles heavy themes like politics, religion and war, and English people are the punchline of every second joke. Oh, and it has a great 90s soundtrack.” It never fails. The sitcom follows four teenage girls, Erin, Orla, Clare and Michelle, as they grapple with the universal problems of being a young adult: intrusive parents, strict Catholic school teachers, crushes, and violent sectarian conflict. Or at least they’re the universal problems faced by teenagers living in Northern Ireland in the 1990s, which is when the show is set. Derry Girls’ genius is its ability to perfectly balance genuinely hilarious moments of teenage humour, wholesome meditations on friendship and love, and coming-out stories alongside a serious engagement with the politics of the era. If you didn’t think jokes about teenage romance could be bolstered by a long-running religious conflict, you haven’t heard Michelle defend her crush on a Protestant: “I think there’s something really sexy about the fact that they hate us so much.” Created and written by Lisa McGee, the show is inspired by her own childhood growing up in Derry during the Troubles, a conflict generally considered to have begun when the city’s Catholic majority protested against Protestant political rule in 1969, sparking the Battle of Bogside. Three years later British soldiers shot 26 unarmed Catholic protesters in Derry, killing 13. The event is known as Bloody Sunday and it had a galvanising impact on the Irish republican movement. The legacy of these events is never far away in Derry Girls. Shots of British soldiers patrolling the streets feature in most episodes, and radio and TV news broadcasts of the conflict regularly punctuate family dinners. It even creeps into school life. “Nobody actually gets expelled,” Michelle says. “Rhonda Gallagher hasn’t even been expelled and she’s in the IRA.” “I’d say that’s probably why,” Erin replies. One of the show’s highlights is the relationship between the girls and Michelle’s cousin James. He serves as the show’s punching bag not only because he’s the only boy in a Catholic girls’ school (“Why can’t I find the boys’ toilet?”) but also because he’s an Englishman surrounded by Irish nationalists. “I can’t tell my rebellions from my risings,” he mourns during one group work assignment. “And whose fault is that?” Michelle fires back. “If your lot had stopped invading us for five fucking minutes there’d be a lot less to wade through! English prick.” The 90s setting gives us more than just an examination of the effects of the Troubles on school kids, though. It allows us to wade in nostalgia, and simultaneously marvel and cringe at the fashion and aesthetics of the era. It’s a useful device to help create atmosphere, but it never feels tokenistic – all the cultural references help deliver an emotional impact, and that’s most obvious in the music choices. The soundtrack is full of classic 90s acts such as Ace of Base, Blur, Cypress Hill, Salt-N-Pepa and, of course, the Corrs. But the best choice of music is saved for the first season’s emotional finale. The girls are performing a dance to Madonna’s Like A Prayer for their Catholic school’s talent show, a perfect way to express the bonds of their friendship. It’s a musical choice loaded with symbolism given the song’s music video led to a Vatican-initiated boycott campaign and protests around the world by Catholics. As the girls are dancing on stage, the show abruptly cuts to Erin’s family watching a news broadcast of a bombing that’s just taken place and Dreams by the Cranberries starts drowning out Madonna. The grief and resignation on the faces of Erin’s parents is a stark contrast to the sheer and absolute joy that only dancing with your friends to iconic pop music can bring. The fact that Derry Girls can regularly pull off these moments of fun and hilarity, and in the same breath force us to reckon with the impact of political violence is why it’s such an irresistible show."
"What is “X Æ A-12”, and why is it trending on Twitter? That, my friend, is the name of tech billionaire Elon Musk and musician Grimes’ first child together. At least according to Elon Musk, who tweeted “X Æ A-12 Musk” when one of his 33.7 million followers demanded to know his newborn baby’s name. Is this … real? Or is he trolling? Probably both, in a sense. Most people are working under the assumption that Musk’s tweet is a code for the baby’s real name. The fact Grimes’ has a track on her latest album, Miss Anthropocene, named ‘4 Æ M’; as in “for Æ Musk”, lends weight to the theory. Then Grimes stepped in to clear things up with a brand new cypher that explained Æ stands for AI and X stands for ‘X’. Glad we’re all on the same page then. But seriously, what does it say on the birth certificate? There are several working theories on how to pronounce ‘X Æ A-12 Musk’ and what it might mean at the moment. What we do know is that the Lockheed A-12 fighter jet’s original code name was ‘Archangel’ – which is pretty on brand for both Musk (who likes aircrafts so much he’s building a space program) and Grimes (who uses plenty of biblical references in her work). As for the ‘X’; one follower guessed ‘Xavier’ which is unlikely, given Musk already has a son named Xavier; Neal, Alexander and Sasha are also popular guesses. As is straight up ‘X’. There was speculation that Æ referred to the ligature Ash. But now Grimes has stepped in to clear things up, it’s possible the baby is really named Xai Archangel Musk. Or, you know X Æ A-12 Musk. As for the “metal rat” bit – a Chinese Zodiac calendar makes that line a little less weird than it originally sounds. Why are people so fascinated with this couple?The pair both had pretty obsessive fan communities going into the relationship – many of whom (mostly Grimes fans) had mixed feelings about them as a couple. Since then there’s been a constant stream of drama about them, including a run in with ubiquitous beefer Azealia Banks, a lot of complaints about their mismatched politics (she’s been a Bernie supporter since 2016; he thinks we should “FREE AMERICA NOW”) and, of course, the baby build up. Grimes announced she was pregnant on Instagram by posting a photoshopped image of herself with a translucent, Space Odyssey-esque fetus inside her, and at the time no one was sure if it was a record teaser or an actual declaration that she was with child. Later she confirmed the news with a more confessional, conventional post, so I’d say that, much like a new Tesla model release or a album drop this is a phased marketing campaign for the miracle of life. But then again, he once got into a Twitter feud with a hero navy diver, so heated it ended up in court; and her entire pop persona is built around weirdness, so who knows what it really says on the birth certificate. Where does this sit on the mad celebrity baby name spectrum?If it’s not a code and the kid really is named X Æ A-12, I’m going to go ahead and award the name five out of five Moon Units. It’s definitely weirder than Blue Ivy (who also has her name worked into plenty of her mum’s creative output); Apple and Moses; Shiloh and Pax, or even Nicholas Cage’s kid Kal-El. But, more likely, it’s a code for Xai Archangel – something a bit more normal sounding than, say, Kulture Kiari Cephus or Raddix Madden. Perhaps in an alternate timeline they would have gone with Pilot Inspektor, but sadly, it’s already taken. Whatever next? How does the next famous baby go further? Are we looking at the child of Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid being called a series of emojis?Honestly, I think weird celebrity baby names are becoming passe. With all the Daeneryses; Marvels and Teslas running around (seriously, 141 babies were named for Musk’s automotive brand in 2017) – calling your kid Kyd, just doesn’t seem that provocative anymore. "
"The announcement on Monday that Sydney’s Carriageworks had entered voluntary administration came as a shock for an arts community already in brace position. “It’s the first big announcement like this but I can tell you now, it won’t be the last,” says Esther Anatolitis, executive director of the National Association of Visual Arts. “What we’re seeing right across Australia is a total loss of self-generated income for galleries. As yet, there’s no strategy looking at how to financially support galleries so that they will be able to survive and reopen.” Carriageworks has been one of the jewels of Sydney’s performance and exhibition venues since 2007, hosting some of the largest-scale art installations seen in Australia at its historic 50-hectare site at the Eveleigh rail yard complex. It served as a hub for festivals and provided a home to leading arts companies. The organisation had its income projections for the current financial year trashed as the coronavirus crisis unfurled, with big-ticket events cancelled or suspended. The decision to enter into administration was sealed when the New South Wales government – which currently does not have an arts minister after the recent resignation of Don Harwin – declined to guarantee future funding. Rumours are swirling about a possible takeover of the venue by the Sydney Opera House. But Carriageworks’ exposure to commercial headwinds is no greater than many others in the sector, says Anatolitis. The Covid-19 shutdown has come hard on the heels of cuts to Australia Council funding and a summer of bushfires that had an impact on gallery attendance and operations, most notably in Canberra. All galleries Australia-wide are closed until further notice. Most if not all are taking considerable financial hits while continuing to manage multimillion-dollar collections and maintain a level of community outreach. Regional galleries have been hard hit by drought, fire and the resulting loss of tourist traffic. “There’s barely been time to recover from that and now we have a global pandemic for which there is no treatment and no vaccine,” Anatolitis says. Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art has accessed the jobkeeper scheme in order to maintain its staff, says its director, Liz Ann Macgregor. “It’s been a lifeline,” she says. “I can’t even begin to tell you of the scenarios we were working through before jobkeeper was announced. All I can say is that they were truly horrible.” Government funding accounts for about 25% of the MCA’s budget, says Macgregor. The rest comes from venue hire (including weddings and corporate events), the museum’s retail and café operations, and philanthropy. Apart from special exhibits, the MCA does not charge an entrance fee. “That was our much-lauded funding mix,” Macgregor says with an exasperated laugh. “And before this crisis, everyone thought that was a great thing. Even the GFC didn’t impact us very much. But this time, 40% of our income vanished overnight. It throws into question the whole orthodoxy of that kind of funding. Those of us who developed really good business models are particularly suffering, much more so than the institutions who get 60, 70, 80% of their funding from government.” The MCA’s philanthropic community has been supportive. “Actually, they’ve been fantastic, telling us that they understand we can’t use the money in the way we wanted to but to please spend it to keep the museum going,” Macgregor says, adding that she has ruled out bringing back an admission fee for the MCA. As it stands, access to the jobkeeper scheme is not an option for Australia’s local council, university or state-owned institutions. “Our permanent full-time and temporary staff continue to work behind the scenes while our doors are closed to the public,” says Michael Brand, director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. “During this period we have also sought to retain and redeploy a number of our regular casuals within the gallery.” Adelaide’s Art Gallery of South Australia is in a similar position. “We’re doing all we can to look after our small number of casuals, some of whom are assisting us to deliver our online programs,” says Rhana Devenport, AGSA’s director, adding that permanent and contract staff had been asked to exhaust all leave entitlements. Like all arts and entertainment enterprises, Australia’s art galleries are keenly awaiting updated advice on social distancing. Galleries, says Anatolitis, are in a far better position to reopen in the next few months than theatres and concert venues. “Galleries are, almost by definition, controlled environments. We can absolutely control the number of people in a space and when we walk into a gallery we don’t generally stand close to other people because art demands, quite often, a deep and solitary response.” Until physical reopening is permitted, galleries and museums nationwide are increasing their digital footprints in order to maintain connections with their communities and artists. The MCA has a virtual tour of its Sydney Biennale exhibition, the Art Gallery of NSW has Together in Art, and the National Gallery of Victoria has virtual tours, including jumping early on digitising its blockbuster Haring/Basquiat (resulting in more than 50,000 online views so far), and the AGSA has a raft of podcasts and talks around 2020 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art: Monster Theatres. Devenport says despite AGSA expanding further into digital, there is much more to be done in what is “an extraordinarily challenging time”. She says what’s needed now is a political strategy that puts the arts at the centre of the population’s long-term wellbeing. Brand agrees: “Art museums will have to play a greater role than ever to support and assist our art communities to survive the pandemic, recover, then thrive again in the long term. This will require enormous action. Some of our initial actions now might be quite small in scale but they will set the tone for what will follow.” Macgregor believes it is important to keep art galleries and museums afloat for economic as well as cultural reasons. “When all this is over, there is going to be a huge growth in domestic tourism and galleries and museums are real drivers in that market. [State] borders are going to open again and all those people who normally go overseas and spend money – something like $6bn – are going to be here and we want to grab some of that, but the museums are going to have to work together,” she says. “Cultural tourists spend three times as much as other tourists, so for the sake of the economy, we need a stimulus package that will allow organisations like ours to reopen.”"
"Jimmy Kimmel apologized on Monday night for retweeting a misleading video which appeared to show Vice-President Mike Pence choosing to carry empty boxes of PPE supplies for a photo-op. “Apologizing to the Trump administration for spreading untruth is like apologizing to Barry Bonds for using steroids. It’s hard,” Kimmel said. It was especially hard, Kimmel added, because outrage directed at him for the mistake “was disgusting. Stupid, too, but mostly disgusting,” especially personal attacks on his family. Kimmel blasted “these people who blindly pledge their allegiance to Donald Trump instead of this country” for their hypocrisy, which “runs so deep they don’t even seem to be aware of it any more. It’s like when an Uber driver wears too much cologne.” Kimmel apologized on Twitter on Friday, yet Pence’s communications director tweeted repeatedly and exclusively about the mistake on Friday, and, Kimmel added, emailed him to demand an apology on-air, “because this is what they’re thinking about while thousands of Americans are dying every day: jokes from late-night talkshow hosts.” Still, “it was my mistake, I do apologize to the vice-president again for spreading misinformation about him – spreading misinformation is their thing and I stepped on their toes,” Kimmel said. “Now that I’ve done that, I’d like the vice-president, since he asked me to apologize, to ask his boss, who lies every time there isn’t a McNugget in his mouth, to apologize for the following perversions of decency and democracy,” Kimmel said, listing off some of the Trump administration’s most egregious actions, including: separating children from their parents at the border, inviting the Taliban to Camp David, siding with Putin over US intelligence, calling neo-Nazis “very fine people”, “ignoring warnings on coronavirus, downplaying the dangers of coronavirus, mishandling the coronavirus, we still don’t have tests for the coronavirus, why are we opening the country when we have no tests for coronavirus?” Perhaps inevitably, the Twitter feud was escalated by Trump, who took time from his Mother’s Day on Sunday morning to call Kimmel a “last place” host. “So, anyway, this is what the White House is working on and thinking about right now,” Kimmel said. “This really is the dumbest time to be alive.” “For months, President Trump has been saying the coronavirus pandemic isn’t as big a deal as everyone is suggesting, but now the virus is responding by saying, ‘knock, knock, byatch,’” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show, reacting to news that two White House staff members – Trump’s valet and Pence’s press secretary (and wife of Stephen Miller) Katie Miller – tested positive for the virus. “Oh snap, the coronavirus is now officially in the White House, and that’s scary. Although if it’s like everything else that lands in the White House, it won’t last more than a few weeks,” Noah said over a photo grid of fired Trump staffers. “I won’t lie,” he added, “I’m not surprised that this cluster started in Stephen Miller’s house – that dude has always given off major bitten-by-a-bat vibes.” And yet, the president still refuses to wear a mask. Last week, he and Melania, both sans masks, attended a ceremony for the 75th anniversary of victory in Europe which included several veterans in their 90s. “Whatever Trump’s excuse was, I just hope all those veterans are safe,” said Noah. “Because could you imagine surviving Hitler, only to be taken out by Trump? That would be so anticlimactic. It would be like if Batman beat Bane, and then died slipping on a banana peel.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also addressed the White House’s coronavirus outbreak – specifically, Trump’s apparent incomprehension of testing’s importance. In a press conference on Friday, Trump said of Katie Miller: “She was tested very recently and tested negative, and then today, I guess, for some reason, she tested positive.” “In the history of dumb things said by Donald Trump – and remember, there will one day be a library filled with them – that might be the dumbest thing he’s ever said,” said Colbert. “Does Trump think the tests are good only if they tell you news you want to hear? ‘My girlfriend took a pregnancy test – it said she wasn’t pregnant. Then we had a bunch of sex, and for some reason all of a sudden, it says she’s having a baby. That’s why these tests aren’t so great. The tests really should start wearing a condom.’” On Monday afternoon, “to make himself feel better” about his plummeting approval ratings, Colbert said, Trump held a press briefing in the Rose Garden, “and he got it going with one of his classic lies,” telling reporters: “If somebody wants to be tested right now, they’ll be able to be tested.” “OK, that’s not true,” Colbert interjected. “Lots of people want a test but they can’t get one, because they don’t play in the NBA or aren’t a tiger in the Bronx zoo. So if you want a test, you have to work on your three-pointer or eat a raw gazelle.” “Anywhere between one to two thousand Americans are dying every day from the coronavirus and yet rather than confront that reality, Trump is doing the only thing he knows, and that’s lying his way through it,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. “He’s trying to dead-eye mind-trick Americans into thinking coronavirus will simply go away.” For example, Trump told reporters on Friday that coronavirus would soon disappear, even without a vaccine, despite news that two White House staffers had tested positive and a letter from the White House management office encouraging staff to “practice maximum telework” and to “work remotely if at all possible”. “Well, that’s easy for Trump since he’s already spent the last three years teleworking from his home office on the 18th green at Mar-a-Lago,” Meyers deadpanned. “Every time you see him in the Oval Office, that’s just his Zoom background. “Think about that: the president is telling people to get back into the workforce while his own White House tells employees to stay home,” Meyers continued. “One day he’s going to call a press conference to tell us that murder hornets are fake news while a dozen of them carry him back to their nest.”"

"Hi Josh. I’ve just seen a video in which many Australians appear to be smashing their televisions. What is happening please? It’s all about a former reality TV star from Melbourne, his growing Facebook following, and protests against the coronavirus lockdown, media, vaccines, 5G and microchips. Now I am even more confused. How did it start? In April a former reality TV show star, Fanos Panayides, started a Facebook group called “99% unite Main Group ‘it’s us or them’”. In a month it has grown to nearly 40,000 members. There is no real united message in the group except for claims people are not being told the whole story on a wide variety of things: from vaccines, to alleged microchips being installed in the population, to conspiracy theories connecting 5G technology to the coronavirus. Some people are simply opposed to the lockdown. It’s a whole grab bag. Last week Panayides told his followers to smash their TVs in protest of the media “telling us what to think”. Panayides smashed his own TV in his backyard declaring TVs were terrorising the world, and we needed to take the power back. Dozens of his followers followed suit, filming themselves taking hammers and other tools to their own TVs. Panayides still has a TV, however, because in a later video on Facebook he showed a video of it. Since then, he and a group of people from the group protested outside parliament over the lockdown in Melbourne on the weekend. Panayides was one of 10 people arrested over the protest, which police said were in breach of the social distancing rules. Video has circulated online of police moving in to stop Panayides speaking at the event after he attempted to read a verse from Revelations in the Bible which, he says, talks about microchips. I’ve heard about people attacking cell towers and telecom workers in the UK. Is this the same as that? In the initial stages of the pandemic, debunked conspiracy theories blaming the 5G rollout for spreading coronavirus proliferated around the world – mainly on Facebook groups like this one. But while the people attacking those towers were likely also influenced by something they read on Facebook, they didn’t come from exactly the same group. Still, although Facebook has banned posts connecting 5G with coronavirus, it wasn’t hard to find posts on the group complaining about 5G, and connecting it with the Cedar Meats outbreak in Victoria. How do people think 5G could even spread a virus? The reasoning varies depending on the conspiracy you are reading, but the most common one seems to be that because 5G was being rolled out in Wuhan at the time of the outbreak, it must have had some role in it (it didn’t). Other conspiracies falsely claim 5G “poisons cells” or makes it easier to catch coronavirus. None of this is true. Does this all have something to do with controversial reality TV chef and David Icke enthusiast Pete Evans? Again, also adjacent. A word that keeps coming up in the group is “Plandemic”, and Pete Evans’ increasingly conspiratorial Facebook and Instagram feeds have mentioned this word too. Plandemic is a 26-minute documentary that is now banned from Facebook for spreading misinformation about coronavirus. Vimeo and YouTube have also removed it from their platforms. In the video, discredited researcher Judy Mikovits makes a number of inaccurate claims about the origins of Covid-19. One claim, among others, is that Covid-19 is being spread to force vaccines on to the population as a form of control. Mikovits also falsely claims you can retransmit coronavirus to yourself by wearing a face mask. This all sounds bonkers. What’s our leadership doing? The chief health officer Brendan Murphy called out the people trying to connect 5G to coronavirus, stating it was “silly misinformation” and “complete nonsense”. He said: “5G has got nothing at all to do with coronavirus.” Prime minister Scott Morrison was more sympathetic to the protesters over the weekend, stating he understood their frustrations over the restrictions. “It’s a free country, people will make their protest and make their voices heard. But equally, that needs to be done in an appropriate way and it needs to respect the law enforcement authorities who are just simply trying to do their job. So we understand it’s a difficult time and those issues will be dealt with in the normal way.” So they’re not doing heaps then. No – but these protests are not really all that well-attended compared to the ones in the US, so it might be a case of trying to ignore it and hoping it goes away?"
"How do you preserve a pandemic? Libraries, museums and historical associations around the world are struggling to survive right now but they’re also asking themselves this critical question. They know future generations will inevitably study Covid-19 – so what are the moments and materials we should capture for people in the future, and how can we capture them? Collecting institutions around Australia have launched a series of projects aimed at creating coronavirus archives, and key to the ongoing efforts are the contributions of the general public. The State Library of Victoria is working to enlist an army of citizen collectors who can help it gather Covid-19 related materials. This is the idea behind Memory Bank: A Collective Isolation Project, the library’s major pandemic archiving project. “A citizen collector really needs to be an anthropologist for the future and to think about the kinds of things that we take for granted that someone in the future may find absolutely fascinating,” says a senior curator, Carolyn Fraser. She lists leaflets, pamphlets and temporary take-out menus as examples of items that the library might be interested in acquiring. In addition to asking people to hold on to pandemic paraphernalia, the library is also releasing a series of weekly prompts which will encourage people to share details about their pandemic lives. The first prompt was “What’s in your fridge or pantry today?” Few of us would think to photograph our fridge or pantry, but knowing what’s in there could be useful for future scholars. “Things like receipts and shopping lists that, within the context of an archive, are really, really telling for people beyond this moment, may seem like rubbish to us now,” Fraser says. Dr Peter Hobbins, a medical historian, is also working to preserve pandemic-related ephemera. He started the #covidstreetarchive, a grassroots project encouraging people to photograph their streets and neighbourhoods, and to share their snaps on social media. The hashtag is filled with images of familiar sites: “closed” signs in shopfronts, empty streets and teddy bears in windows. “The idea behind the #covidstreetarchive comes out of having been a historian who has studied the 1918-19 influenza pandemic and being aware that there are huge gaps in how we understand what it was like living through that period,” Hobbins says. He notes that our understanding of domestic life and the impact of the 1918 flu on businesses is particularly limited, and he hopes that starting Covid-19 archiving efforts now will help minimise similar gaps for future historians. In many ways, we’re already primed to preserve a pandemic. Smartphones and social media make it easy for us to share details about our daily lives. The New South Wales State Library embarked on a similar project to Hobbins’, asking people to share pictures from self-isolation on social media using the hashtag #NSWathome. By the end of April, thousands of photos had been shared on the hashtag via Instagram and Twitter, from self-isolation dinners and baking projects; home improvement and home-schooling projects; and images of contributors attending Zoom work meetings, workouts and happy hours. People are also being encouraged to keep a written record. The Diary Files is another of the Covid-19 projects launched by the SLNSW. A collective journalling project, contributors are invited to write and share short reflections on their circumstances. Early contributors include the literary and cultural personalities Tim Ross, Gretel Killeen, Michelle Law, Tony Birch and Wendy Sharpe, giving accounts of their experience during self-isolation. Bruce Baskerville, a historian involved in a similar project at the Centre for Western Australian History, is also encouraging people to keep a record of their thoughts, feelings and observations. “This is creating the archive that historians and researchers will use in the future to see how ordinary people experienced this event,” Baskerville says. Historians and curators involved in collecting efforts acknowledge that they don’t know how future generations will use the archives. Your social media snaps could end up in a museum exhibition; your diary entries could be the basis for a podcast; the teddy bear in your front window could feature in a material history of the pandemic. As Fraser says: “There’s a huge range of possibilities, and probably possibilities that we can’t even imagine right now.”"
"The choreographer and dancer Hofesh Shechter was born in Jerusalem in 1975 and studied at the city’s Academy for Dance and Music. He moved to London in 2002 and won the 2004 Place Prize’s audience award for his sextet Cult. In 2008 he founded the Hofesh Shechter Company, and made his Royal Ballet debut in 2015 with Untouchable. He was awarded an OBE in 2018. Shechter’s new productions, Double Murder and Political Mother Unplugged, will tour the UK and Europe later this year. #SaatchiTakeover The Saatchi Gallery is posting a new theme every week on its social media platforms and anyone can respond by sending their art, which, if chosen, is presented online. It’s an eclectic, surprising and ever-changing spring of new art by new artists. I love that our situation weirdly gives birth to being exposed to more, and unpredictable, artistic content. Being a member of such an unpredictable art form as contemporary dance, I’m a fan of mixed bags. Surprises are healthy. If you have a strong heart. Unorthodox (Netflix) This mini-series is a surprisingly realistic depiction of Jewish Orthodox life. A powerful piece. It took me way back to my childhood in Jerusalem, where I witnessed close and far family members, either within, or brushing close to, the Orthodox community. It’s about a member of the Orthodox community in Brooklyn breaking free from the mental and emotional prison of that community without really knowing that she was in a prison. It’s very hard to understand how free we are or not, or whether we are just stuck in a culture we agreed with because we didn’t have a choice. It’s a fascinating and touching story that made me question my own world, my own bubble and beliefs. The cast is unknown to me and it was a pleasure to discover such brilliant acting by unfamiliar faces. Pierre Bensusan: Azwan Pierre Bensusan is an incredibly gifted guitar player – more of an artist, really, or a poet. Some of his solo albums make it hard for the ear to believe that he is playing it all solo, which he does. This is not to take away from the humongous heart that goes into his playing. It’s sweet, melancholic, beautifully ancient-sounding at times, and will transport you into the evening with a dreamy stare in your eyes. Bensusan’s latest album, Azwan, features some talented guest musicians too. Azul My partner and I are rediscovering old-fashioned board games that require a good amount of time and headspace. Azul, in which one has to gain points by collecting colourful tiles and ordering them cleverly on the board, is very pleasant on the eye and mathematically lightly challenging. It stretches your mind with questions about skills and cunning versus luck of the draw, and why you actually won or lost. Gaga Online Gaga is the movement language of Ohad Naharin, one of the world’s masters of choreography who created a way to involve “normal” people in movement and dance. The language is simple yet powerful and deep, and a lot of fun too. Classes can be found online these days, and participation is on a donation basis. Certainly something to try at home! It’s always important, but especially now, to move every day.

Banana pancakes Not only do we have time to cook now, we simply have to. On a “normal” week in my life I travel constantly and eat out a lot. Now, cooking has become a familiar routine and I love it. Finding little recipes that we can do together as a family with the kids is precious. The banana pancakes on superhealthykids.com has kept us going for three weekends in a row. The recipe has too many oats in it, so I reduce it a little. It’s delicious and hearty and not that unhealthy! (No sugar – until you put on the maple syrup.)"
"Oh, thank God that’s over. Feels so good to be out and about again, meeting people, hugging the grandchildren. And wow! We’re on a giant waterslide in the jungle too! Wait, there’s Iain Duncan-Smith in a smoking jacket, giving me notes on my 100-stanza poem about a magic breakfast. Luckily, I can shoot him dead and – oh, I see brain, thanks a lot. Just another dream, shattered before I could even pull the trigger. Cheers. Now I’m awake, pursued by news. I abseil quickly past the mass graves, past Trump’s latest mad ramblings in the style of Tony Soprano’s mum, past The Collapse of Everything. I reach the bottom of the Guardian homepage and stay there for a while, staring gratefully at the image of a harmless toasted cheese sandwich. It’s just an article about making the perfect sandwich. I want to burst into song, or tears. Remember happier times, when there was only full-spectrum eco-cide to fear? Update: once you’ve pushed through the novel-virus-sphere, all the Old Testament bangers are still there. War. Famine. Noah-level maxi-floods. Forests of pure fire. Religious poison sprayed into the air from the Midwest to the Middle East. ALSO, melting Arctic ice is about to release a whole new toxic anthology of ancient pandem classics: rare Mesolithic deep cuts, some real body-slamming hard-plague ward-fillers. Perhaps as a nod to this larger narrative, the weather here in Lancaster has been full-on sarcastic. Really sunny, but with crazy gusting wind. A bit like being on holiday in Spain except, instead of that chilled feeling of waiting for an enormous seafood lunch and another cold bottle, there’s a very different chilled feeling, like the dread of waiting day after day for test results. Meanwhile, normal chit-chat with Harry Next Door about mice and meds has hit full cosmic implosion. Some of the morning tablets he laid out last thing at night have been eaten by a mouse. Apparently, it found the Gabapentin capsules delicious. I like to think it had a fearless life, and a neuropathically painless death. We must seek the light in the gloom, the toasted cheese sandwich in the newsfeed. Kindness is everywhere. People, demonstrably, are mostly brilliant. This will pass. My grandsons, who live in Seoul, went back to nursery school last week – in masks, but still. Our little pond’s alive with tadpoles. The vapour trails that once hatched our bit of sky all the way from the Irish Sea to the Pennines are now as rare as woodpeckers. Ironically, we’ve had a woodpecker in the garden for the first time. This’ll make you laugh. “Amid the coronavirus crisis, police and pranksters around the world are helping to spread good cheer.” Not joking, that’s what it says: “Police and pranksters.” OK, for a start, Google “pranksters” and tell me which one of them you wouldn’t want to see inflated with helium until they fucking burst. And police? Good cheer? We’re taking that with a spoonful of sugar, yeah? For anyone who loves wearing a hi-vis and bossing people about like Mary Poppins with a taser, lockdown has been truly bumptious. Community policing now apparently includes deciding whether yoga’s proper exercise in a park, whether gin or pencils are essential items, and bellowing “People are DYING!” when challenged. (Sidenote: I am now ending every argument with this line.) Last week, HM Government’s mysterious Orwellian nudgethink (“You Are Safer Indoors”, “Watch Television and Carry On” “You Could … Bake Something?”) took a sinister turn with: “BREAKING THE RULES IS BREAKING THE LAW.” What bloody rules? Finders keepers? Fight Club? Do not ask for credit as a refusal often offends?  The creatures outside looked from the executive to the legislative and from legislative to executive, and from executive to legislative again – but already it was impossible to say whether the Magnum, which had been on the ground for more than five seconds, should be eaten. People say: “You’re a writer, I bet you haven’t noticed any difference. You just stay indoors and type anyway. Wanker.” Fair enough and, yeah, I count my blessings. As it stands, I’m Extremely Vulnerable and Shielded. Things could be worse. Obviously, I could “get it” and my lungs, already hollow cathedrals of Gothic tracery, would be carpet-bombed, Dresdened. Or I could be one of Toby Young’s Old Expendables, shuffling off to the local fentanyl pod for the glory of the herd. We all dream our weird dreams alone. In mine, I’m always in the old world, before the Invisible Flood – with people, going somewhere. Everything’s weird but normal again. Then we wake and everything’s normal but weird. Hold tight, everyone. Love, love will stick us back together again."

"The plight of the romantic comedy over the past decade has, for me, been painful to watch. Once a staple of the multiplex, low-to-mid-budget romcoms in the vein of Suddenly 30 or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days have all but disappeared from screens, replaced by gross-out bro comedies, superhero movies, and, on the other end of the spectrum, “important” films. Most people probably don’t yearn for another Legally Blonde, but for someone like me – whose childhood was filled with DVD screenings of ultra-saturated stories of hardened career girls and their quests for love – there’s nothing like a humble romcom. Films like Bridget Jones’ Diary and Monster-in-Law, with their perfect blend of cynicism and fairytale serendipity, shaped my personality more than I’d care to admit. Finding something to fill the void was hard – until I stumbled across the TV show Younger. Created by Sex and the City’s Darren Star, Younger ticks all the boxes on my perfect romcom checklist: it has a bizarre premise (a 40-something divorcee, played by Sutton Foster, pretends to be 27 in order to get a publishing job); a cast of quirky gal-pals (Hillary Duff as a savvy careerist, Molly Bernard as a wacky publicist, Debi Mazar as a wise lesbian artist); a saucy love triangle (Foster’s Liza is caught between her staid, enigmatic CEO, and a sensitive, chiseled tattoo artist); and a hardened-but-caring boss, played hilariously by Miriam Shor. Like all the best romcoms, the show’s leads have entry-level jobs in a dying industry (in this case, publishing), but can somehow afford designer outfits and glamorous Williamsburg lofts; they attend parties every evening and still manage to find time to read thousand-page manuscripts and marketing plans. In Younger’s version of publishing, business meetings are more often than not excuses to drink heavily or dive into a rooftop pool, and signing an author often involves going on a few dates with them, too. Younger is a fairytale, and it’s all the better for it. And like many from the genre’s Golden Age (roughly 2001–08, in my estimation), the show also provides a slyly salient critique of the feminist mores of its time. In the same way that Bridget Jones’ Diary smartly found comedy in the tension between its title character’s desire for a romantic partner and her desire to not need a romantic partner – in the process skewering the concept of “Having It All” – Younger picks apart the corporatisation of identity politics with a surprisingly ruthless eye. Many episodes introduce thinly veiled stand-ins for feminist authors like Lena Dunham and Cat Marnell, using them as an opportunity to expose the narcissism that often underscored 2010s girl-boss feminism; other plot lines ponder why youthful activists seem to abhor every kind of discrimination except ageism, the bogeyman that follows Liza around every corner in the form of new fads and social standards. One particularly great episode involves Duff’s character Kelsey attending a networking function at feminist co-working space The Nest, only to find that it’s more of an opportunity for rich attendees to shill their products and talk up their credentials than an opportunity to connect. The episode aired years before a New York Times expose alleged that The Nest’s real-life analogue, The Wing, was doing the same thing. It’s this tonal sweet-spot – shrewd where it counts, blithely far-fetched everywhere else – that keeps me coming back to Younger. At its worst, it’s still a well-acted, delightfully lightweight confection; at its sharpest, it feels strangely essential, carrying the torch of the best 2000s romcoms and forging a new path for mid-budget, female-centric comedies. For me, the romantic comedy is, sadly, dead. Long live Younger."

"“From the beginning of this crisis, Donald Trump has been saying a lot of not-smart things,” said Trevor Noah on Monday’s episode of The Daily Show, such as that coronavirus would magically disappear with spring weather, or that there was “nothing to lose” by trying hydroxychloroquine. “But a few days ago, as you’ve probably heard by now, President Trump created shock waves of stupidity with his latest and probably greatest unlicensed medical opinion yet.” That would be Trump’s headline-dominating, beyond-the-pale suggestion at a press conference last Thursday that Americans should try blasting themselves with UV rays or injecting disinfectants, such as bleach, to treat the virus. “This is maybe the first time in documented history that we’ve seen someone not-thinking out loud,” said Noah. “Injecting disinfectants into your body? This is the problem when the dumbest person in the room thinks they’re the smartest person. “I almost don’t even blame Trump, because there’s no way he even understands what bleach is,” Noah continued. “Like, do you think Donald Trump has ever cleaned anything in his life? Do you think he has ever actually used disinfectant? Cleaning supplies might as well be magical potions to him.” Noah broke out his Trump impression: “I dropped a hamburger on the carpet, then some Mexican lady came in with some Clorox, sprayed it on the carpet, said some spell in Spanish, and then it was gone.” “If you’re some random guy on the internet with 12 followers, you can say shit like this and it really doesn’t matter,” Noah explained. “But Donald Trump is not just some random guy.” And in what Noah is now calling “the pandumbic”, Trump’s comments have had significant fallout, such as upticks in calls to state poison control hotlines, and the release of warnings from cleaning supply companies to not eat bleach. “Yep, this is where we are now: authorities have to respond to the president’s ideas the same way they do to viral TikTok challenges,” said Noah. Although he did love that people still called their health departments to ask whether they should consume bleach, because it means “that even the people who are dumb enough to drink bleach are still smart enough not to trust something that Donald Trump said”. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also addressed Trump’s endorsement of consuming bleach, since “it’s not enough that his supporters are all white on the outside”. “Now, obviously, no one should do that,” Colbert continued. “So this weekend, people did that.” Calls to poison control forced the president to claim that his comments were merely sarcastic. “Oh yeah, Trump is famous for his sarcastic comments,” Colbert deadpanned, then played a clip of Trump’s oath of office. “Hilarious!” Trump also lashed out at reporters on Twitter, decrying journalists and demanding they hand back their “Noble prizes”. When the internet pointed out that actually, there are no Nobel prizes for journalism, Trump again invoked sarcasm as an excuse. “Does sarcasm ever work?” he tweeted. “Oh, sarcasm works great,” Colbert said. “Sarcasm is absolutely the best thing for a president to do in the middle of a pandemic. You’re doing amazing, Mr ‘President’.” “I’ve gotta be honest, when we went on hiatus a week ago, I did not expect that when I came back I’d be talking about the president suggesting using disinfectants and powerful lights to cure coronavirus,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. “But then again, that’s on me. I should have expected it. We should all know by now: Trump will be more outlandish with each passing week because that’s his nature.” Still, Meyers was baffled – “You have two renowned scientists working with you. Why are you pitching ideas like a sixth-century druid?” The comments track, though, as “Trump’s ideas for solutions are things that have always been there and require no work or effort from him. He’s like a kid who forgot it was show-and-tell” and points out the sun, Meyers said. Unfortunately, Meyers concluded, “we just need to be prepared. This is going to keep happening,” since “Trump is a powerful, dumb guy and he is friends with other powerful, dumb guys and they like to call each other up and pitch their dumb ideas to each other. The whole thing is like a lifelong episode of Shark Tank where no one has a good idea and everyone wins.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel at least found one potential silver lining in Trump’s false dismissal of his dangerous bleach endorsement as sarcasm: “Can we claim we were being sarcastic when we elected him president?” After Trump’s press conference last week, the Environmental Protection Agency issued guidelines for disinfectants with the line: “Do not ingest disinfectant products.” Kimmel said: “Unfortunately, many of those who support Trump are perfectly happy to ingest disinfectant products if the president tells them to do it.” Even the makers of Lysol had to issue a warning. “I think this might be the first president ever to embarrass a cleaning product,” Kimmel said. “Usually, when a human being says something that is dangerous and dumb and gets a ton of backlash for it, they either apologize or at the very least, reel it in,” Kimmel concluded. “But if you’re Donald Trump, you just don’t do that. You just keep talking and talking and you try to bury it all under a mountain of nonsense.”"
"A standalone single that came out of the early sessions for the 2018 soundtrack A Star Is Born, The Cure pinches too liberally from the tropical-tinged “Spotify sound” of the time, but under the twinkly synths sits a heartfelt lyric about the healing power of love. Premiered at Coachella in 2017, it was dedicated not only to her fans, but also to a close friend who had cancer. The German EDM producer Zedd helps concoct a ludicrous melange of grinding synths, house breakdowns and vaudeville on the third single from 2013’s chaotic album Artpop. Lyrically, Gaga explores the power moves behind specific sexual positions (GUY stands for Girl Under You), then ruins the whole thing with this clunker: “Love me, love me, please retweet.” While 2008’s debut album The Fame teased the idea of Gaga the megastar, 2009’s eight-track spin-off The Fame Monster cemented it. As its only conventional ballad, Speechless sticks out like a sore thumb. But its slurred, whiskey-soaked vocals and over-the-top 70s rock production lend it a knowingly playful edge. Also: during those early hi-NRG, hit-packed shows, it was the perfect excuse for a bar/loo break. For the majority of 2016’s album Joanne, Gaga swapped leotard-sporting, high-drama dance-pop for ill-fitting, smoke-damaged plaid-rock. Out went the likes of Zedd and Madeon; in came Mark Ronson and Father John Misty. Thankfully a hint of the old Gaga can be found in the chugging groove of the camp cowboy fantasy John Wayne. Artpop found Gaga careening between genres with more than a hint of desperation, but she finds space to breathe on the skyscraping Gypsy. What starts out as a muted piano ballad balloons into a joyous, galloping Europop stomper, complete with a central lyric about the loneliness of fame that doesn’t make your eyes roll out of their sockets. Referencing the uber-ballads Without You and All By Myself, this tear-jerking closer from A Star Is Born is given the full Whitney Houston treatment by Gaga, who doesn’t let a single syllable go unadorned. One for the anti-pop brigade who remain unconvinced about her vocal prowess. With its central synth riff and its lyrical reference in the bridge, the throbbing, horned-up Heavy Metal Lover is the cooler older sister to the eager-to-please Born This Way (from the homonymous album). “I want your whiskey mouth all over my blond south,” coos Gaga, before seemingly reading from a Countryfile voiceover script as she intones: “Dirty pony, I can’t wait to hose you down.” You and I originally appeared on the setlist for the Monster Ball tour in early 2011 as a contemplative piano ballad. By the time it appeared on Born This Way later that year, it had mutated into a strange hybrid of Queen (Brian May plays guitar on it) and Shania Twain (Twain’s long-term collaborator and ex-husband Mutt Lange produced it), but without leaning enough into either camp. On the far superior Mark Taylor remix, the riddle is solved and Twain reigns supreme. Sure, Bradley Cooper has a pleasant growl of a voice, but it is Gaga who takes A Star Is Born’s instantly vintage-sounding dustbowl anthem and shoots a rocket up its backside. The line: “I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in,” is the song’s devastating centrepiece, but surely the Oscar was in the bag from the moment she spectacularly shifted through the gears on those wordless moans that spawned a million memes. In hindsight, Gaga had essentially auditioned for her role in A Star Is Born on Joanne, with this lovely, stripped-back ballad showcasing her more rough-hewn vocals and the idea of fighting for love against all the odds. It was propelled into the US Top 5 three months after its initial release following her spectacular performance at Super Bowl LI in 2017. An emblem of how keen Gaga was to move away from her old self came early in the campaign for Joanne. Premiering its lead single, Perfect Illusion, on BBC Radio 1, she was keen to let the public know the lyrics had been crafted on an old typewriter, as if even putting pen to pad left her too open to claims of frivolity. A similar joy vacuum almost upends the song itself, but there is just enough recklessness in its heady swirl of Kevin Parker-assisted glam rock. Despite being one of her biggest songs, Gaga confessed to hating Telephone during an interview with Popjustice in 2011, describing its production and mixing process as “very stressful”. Originally rejected by Britney Spears (her demo leaked online in 2010), a subsequent duet between the two was then rumoured to have been curtailed by Gaga, who opted for Beyoncé instead. Either way, the result is a turbo-charged, constantly mutating dancefloor behemoth about suffocating relationships. It has the audacity to utilise Beyoncé sparingly and somehow get away with it. The story goes that LoveGame was written in just four minutes, with Gaga buzzing from a previous night’s club-based escapades. Noticing a man she fancied, she apparently marched up to him and declared: “I wanna take a ride on your disco stick,” a chat-up line she would later work into the track’s opening couplet.  There is more penis chat on this throbbing slab of dance-pop that delves into Gaga’s relationship with sex, and bad boys in particular. As she would explore later with Born This Way’s Judas, dynamics become increasingly important as the song goes on, with the zipping, chunky synths of the verses giving way to a sunburst chorus. As Gaga’s fame increased, so her worldview seemed to shrink. The lead single from Artpop focused on the not-exactly-relatable feeling of missing having thousands of people screaming for you; it was written after she was forced to cancel her Born This Way Ball stadium tour due to a hip injury. It houses one of her most uplifting choruses, with Gaga sounding delirious throughout. After the muted reaction to Joanne was followed by the huge success of A Star Is Born, many felt Gaga might persist with that more rustic, singer-songwriter fare. Thankfully, the neon-hued Stupid Love (the lead single, co-written with Max Martin, from the pending-but-delayed album Chromatica) is a big, dumb return to Born This Way’s thundering dance-pop, complete with an exceptional pre-chorus – “I freak out, freak out, freak out” – perfect for cooped-up isolation workouts. Gaga’s finest ballad is also her character Ally’s theme song in A Star Is Born. Like most of her best songs, it was written and recorded quickly, with the creases and scuffs in her vocals adding to the emotion behind the delicate pre-chorus, before she finds more solid ground on the gorgeous open road of a chorus. Born This Way represented Gaga’s first real misstep in the eyes of the public. There were criticisms about the gay-saviour lyrics, the use of racial stereotypes and, perhaps most crucially from a tabloid angle, the accusation it ripped off Madonna’s Express Yourself. As it was cravenly written to be a plain-speaking, empowering anthem, any accusations of a lack of nuance seem to miss the point, and there is something undeniably intoxicating about that mammoth chorus. Wherefore art thou, Colby O’Donis? To be fair, it could just as easily have been Gaga that time forgot, with this hedonistic debut single coming at a time when the charts were hardly lacking in dancefloor-ready pop bangers. The producer RedOne, who worked extensively on The Fame and The Fame Monster, utilises the one-finger synth figure and chunky bass that would become his trademark, while Gaga attacks the vocal with the passion of someone who realises this is her big break. Swathes of the sprawling Born This Way album nod to religion, but on Marry the Night – which opens with a plaintive church organ before exploding into a club banger imbued with prime Whitney euphoria – Gaga sings the praises of her home town, New York, and of the courage it took not to fall into a post-fame Hollywood trap. Like the majority of Born This Way, the gleefully ludicrous Scheiße was recorded on a tour bus as Gaga traversed the planet on the Fame Monster Ball tour. Inspired by a heavy night in Berlin, it sandwiches the city’s techno scene between a layer of cheesy Eurohouse, complete with a pogoing synth riff and an earworm hook of garbled German. Originally mooted as the third single from The Fame Monster, but rejected by Gaga in favour of Alejandro, Dance in the Dark has always been a fan favourite. Opening with orgasmic moans and a stuttering vocal sample, it blossoms into a deliciously outrageous, sky-scraping chorus that pierces through the mesh of synths like a laser. Lyrically, Gaga fuses gothic imagery with the idea of physical shame during sex. While Artpop’s favoured first single Applause was about being Gaga – with the fame she had craved now a prison of sorts – the superior Sexxx Dreams celebrated nothing more than the joys of fantasising about “doing really nasty things” with another person. “I can’t believe I’m telling you this, but I’ve had a couple drinks and ... Oh my God!” Gaga giggles halfway through, drunk on lust. As if to prove her debut single, Just Dance, was no fluke, Gaga and RedOne upped the ante with its follow-up. Built around a similarly intoxicating synth riff, and an early trait of wordless, repetitive hooks, the global No 1 was inspired by Gaga’s efforts to hide the fact she spent her time in bed with an ex-boyfriend fantasising about women. Suffice to say, the line: “’Cause I’m bluffin’ with my muffin,” is not about a trip to Greggs. Inspired by ludicrous heavy metal bands such as Kiss and Iron Maiden, as well as the driving rock of Bruce Springsteen, Hair feels like the soaring centrepiece to an imaginary, leather-clad jukebox musical. In fact, if you think of it like that, the song’s central premise – that identity and self-confidence can be influenced by a haircut – feels less trite, with the song’s broad strokes and naive charm creating something undeniably joyous. Dismissed at the time as Gaga’s attempt to remake Bad Romance, Judas plays out more like that track’s gloriously unhinged, turbo-charged sequel. Gaga alternates between a robotic half-rap, a strange caterwauling shriek and then, on the Steps-esque chorus, a pure pop vocal perfect for radio ubiquity. Underneath the lyrical blasphemy, RedOne cooks up an industrial-strength soup of house, pummelling electro and, at the 2min 40sec mark, the sound of a synth disintegrating punctured perfectly by a levity-inducing “Eww” from Gaga. Initially given a lukewarm reaction by US radio, Alejandro has become one of Gaga’s most enduring singles. Perhaps that is down to its timeless influences, be it the lyrical references to Abba, or the way its mid-tempo BPM recalls the 90s Eurodance boom of Ace of Base, a sound that has endured thanks to Scandinavia’s continued pop dominance. Gaga, occasionally testing out a dodgy Spanish accent, sings her goodbyes to a trio of no-good men with a delicious flourish. While Just Dance and Poker Face were still being dismissed as flukes, this more featherlight affair, complete with a yearning chorus, showcased a different side to Gaga’s artistry. It also highlighted her early obsession with every facet of being famous, with the song’s central theme of struggling to balance success and love refracted through the prism of wooing the paparazzi. In an early example of her theatrical flair, she performed it at the 2009 MTV VMAs while swinging from a chandelier covered in fake blood. Born This Way’s third single kept things refreshingly simple. Inspired by the death of her grandfather, its uplifting central message of living in the moment is buoyed by a straightforward pop structure that never complicates the near flawless chorus. Keen to add to the song’s Springsteen-esque rush, Gaga convinced E Street Band member Clarence Clemons to freestyle a sax solo. The pop landscape into which Bad Romance was released in 2009 was overrun with buoyant, hands-in-the-air pep. Gaga had helped prop up the party on The Fame, but quickly saw an opportunity to become pop’s gothic-tinged outlier, one who would actively crave an emotionally devastating bad romance, as opposed to delicately unpacking the fallout from it over a club-lite production. On Bad Romance, she stomps petulantly around RedOne’s churning cacophony of ever-expanding synths, veering in and out of dangerous infatuation. It is a song built on layers and layers of undeniable hooks, from the opening “Oh, oh, oh” to the inbuilt chant of her surname (perfect for cementing that cultural ubiquity) to the section where she sings in French for no obvious reason. Delirious, delicious pop perfection."
"Michael Frayn was born in London in 1933 and began his career as a journalist on the Guardian and the Observer. His novels include Towards the End of the Morning, Headlong and Spies. The fifth of his 17 plays, Noises Off, was recently chosen as one of Britain’s favourite three plays. His new book of short comic pieces, Magic Mobile: 35 pre-loaded new text files, is published by Faber. Generations of readers loved your newspaper columns; how did you come to return to the form?Second childhood, I suppose. And the balance of nature, perhaps; if your vita turns out to be reasonably longa, as mine has, then to compensate your ars gets naturally more brevis. Do they give you the same pleasure to write as they did, especially without deadlines?I’m afraid they do, and yes, especially without deadlines. I have rather mixed feelings about this. There’s something slightly disgraceful about old folks having fun, when they should, as Russians used to say, be making their souls in preparation for the long funlessness of eternity. What kind of “magic” mobile do you own?I have an iPhone, and it’s a most beautiful object just to hold in one’s hands. But what this slim and graceful artefact can do! Conjure up my family and friends; most of the world’s great music, books, and pictures; the latest news; tomorrow’s weather; a taxi to the station; the time of the next train to Bucharest or Weston-super-Mare; and a summary of everything that human beings have thought and discovered in the last 3,000 centuries. It (and the complex of electronics that nourishes it) must surely be one of the greatest peaks of human achievement. So why are you mocking it?To express my awe in some manageable form, in the way that one might gently tease somebody one admires and loves. Besides, its perfection sometimes fails for a moment – or, even harder to bear, shows up one’s own incompetence, or inability to remember where one concealed a vital password. Do the pieces arise out of a gentle slow-growing irritation with modern consumerism, or an abrupt fury?Out of amusement, mostly. Which of course can turn without warning to abrupt fury. Your first novel, The Tin Men, was about scientists programming computers to take over human thinking. In Magic Mobile, a computer retaliates against the constant insults of its impatient owner. Do you see these machines as a mirror of our own character and folly?Human beings who behave like machines; machines that behave like human beings. They’re both ways of dramatising the elusive but fundamental way in which human beings, however stupid, have some essential and irreducible faculty of choice and invention that machines cannot reproduce, however clever. You started out as a reporter; how did you come to comic writing?I was set to write a kind of diary column three times a week. This was on the Guardian, back in the 50s. It meant finding an endless amount of raw material, and I began to eke out the supply with bits of my own invention, in imitation of the established funny columns of the day, such as Peter Simple in the Telegraph and Beachcomber in the Express. The flow of fiction turned out to be a lot easier to maintain than fact. Is humour your natural cast of mind, as well as your professional element?It’s not really a question of what I’m like – it’s everything else! There are a lot of serious and terrible things in the world. But there are also some funny ones, and you’d have to be a funny sort of person not to notice. In the new book, in a domestic dialogue about buying teabags, the husband replies with the empty rhetoric of a politician. Might he belong equally well to any party?I thought it was the wife speaking, and I had one particular politician of the day in mind. But in spite of all her heroic efforts to say nothing that could disrupt the fragile balance between her extremely quarrelsome colleagues, they drove her out of office nearly a year before the book was published. Now you’ve even forgotten her very distinctive tone of voice. You’re right, I have already forgotten her! I loved the online article that repeatedly asks for the reader’s endorsement; how do you rate (so to speak) today’s interactive, below-the-line, star-rated media?Oh, about three stars. In a wonderful pastiche of Waiting for Godot, every pause is filled with phone-browsing. Are you hopeful that we might recover our powers of concentration?I thought that my Vladimir and Estragon, unlike their originals, were lucky to have their magical machines to keep them entertained while they waited. In fact they don’t have to wait more than about 10 minutes, because they’ve also used them to set up the meeting with their particular Godot much more efficiently than the originals. Some people wish your fiction – Headlong and Spies, for instance – was just as famous as Noises Off. Do you have specially tender feelings about the different genres in which you work?Odd how separate the audience for novels and plays seems to be. And yes, I wish they were all equally well known, and feel a certain defensive affection for the ones that aren’t. Do you think theatre will have a different future, after this pandemic?If we still have to maintain social distancing, as seems likely, then it certainly will. Live theatre depends upon an audience present in the flesh, sitting close together and being infected with each other’s responses. Particularly comedy. Michael Rudman, who directed some of my early plays, always maintained that the only way to do it is with a full house. Difficult to achieve, even at the best of times, but an ideal as forgotten as courtly love if everyone in the audience has to have four or five empty seats to left and right of them, and two or three empty rows in front and behind. Easier to get a drink in the interval, of course."

"Isn’t it funny, in a lovely sort of way, how rewatching certain films and TV shows feels like reacquainting yourself with old friends? The idea of catching up with loved ones draws rather melancholic feelings these days. In the era of physical distancing and self-isolation, most of us having resigned ourselves to not seeing anybody in person – let alone shaking their hands or giving them a hug – for months. Tactile qualities – that feeling of being able to reach out and touch something – are synonymous with the beautiful handmade aesthetics of Aardman Animations, the British studio that specialises in claymation. Two of the studio’s beloved franchises, Shaun the Sheep and Wallace and Gromit, belong to worlds I like to revisit when I’m feeling down, finding their joie de vivre and loving, crafted constructions a kind of soul-invigorating tonic. For kids, you say? Au contraire! Both franchises accommodate all ages and, in fact, all schedules too, available in snackable two-minute instalments as well as half-hour episodes and feature-length spin-offs. The briefer the running time, generally speaking, the more appropriate for young children; the short episodes usually don’t have much in the way of storytelling sophistication or messages likely to resonate with adults. The movies are a different story. Full of visual wit, narrative ingenuity and highly creative arrangement of space and setting, they are striking achievements that reflect a unique filmmaking style. The depth and genius of the Shaun the Sheep Movie (which also has an excellent sequel – A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon) belies its kiddish material materials. At various points the film channels two of my favourite filmmakers – Jacques Tati and Luis Buñuel – as well as comic geniuses from the pre-talkies era: namely Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. It is in effect a silent film, capturing in entirely visual ways the journey of the titular mammal and his friends to the big city, where they try to find their amnesia-affected farmer, who suffered a blow to the head that was entirely their fault. Like Tati’s films Playtime and Mon Uncle, speech is primarily used not for the communication of dialogue but as a kind of sound effect, reiterating the film’s visual focus. When the sheep visit a fancy restaurant and pretend to be diners, co-directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzak venture into a surreal Buñuellian space reminiscent of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, Buñuel’s noodle-scratching 1972 oddity about a group of people who are always arriving for dinner but never get the opportunity to eat. In a clever joke early on, the sheep hide from a maniacal animal catcher by posing in front of an advertisement depicting an idyllic green countryside; their assailant looks their way but only sees them as part of the picture. Jean Baudrillard would surely have relished this moment, in which reality has merged with a simulation and a simulation becomes reality. A similar idea was explored in the TV show: the fifth episode of the fourth season, to be precise (no you’re obsessed!). An attempted installation of a 3D television goes awry, leaving a huge TV-shaped hole in the farmer’s wall. To resolve this situation Shaun and the other sheep put on a performance, tricking the farmer into believing he’s watching TV, including staging a tennis match that results in the farmer getting whacked in the face by a tennis ball – which he considers to be evidence of highly impressive 3D technology. The feature film Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a less cerebral and more conventional (including dialogue) experience, combining a similarly wonderful, painstaking aesthetic with a midnight movie premise. When trying to invent a machine that can cure rabbits of their lust for carrots, Wallace accidentally fuses his mind with the mind of a rabbit (just run with it). This creates a werewolf-like situation, with him transforming at night into a huge mutant rabbit thing that terrorises the town – just in time for its annual giant vegetable competition. Given Wallace is an inventor, co-directors Steve Box and Nick Park deal not just with visual inventions in his reality, but visual inventions in ours, turning daffy domestic contraptions into the basis for entire sequences. At the start of the film, for instance, we watch Wallace’s ridiculous machine for getting dressed, which involves him being woken up by a retractable hand that comes out of the wall and entices him to consciousness by putting cheese under his nostrils (he loves cheese). His bed then pushes him headfirst into a long chute system, too elaborate to explain in a small amount of words, and far more entertaining to simply watch. In the Oscar-winning 1995 short A Close Shave, there is a different wake-up machine – this one involving Wallace falling through a hole in the floor, into a pair of pants laid out vertically, then onto a spot around the breakfast table, where he gets pelted with porridge by a malfunctioning food-serving machine. Again this kind of comedy has a very long history. It’s not something you see all that much of in contemporary productions, but it makes these gems from Aardman feel kind of old but also kind of new. Perhaps the word I’m looking for is “timeless”.

"Nostalgia isn’t what it used to be. And neither is children’s telly. Even before the internet made viewing anything possible at any time, the explosion of cable channels such as Nickelodeon and CBeebies churned out enough comedies, cartoons and TV movies to turn any child’s eyes square. Not so in my formative years, the late-60s to mid-1970s. We had time to burn then, especially when that nice Mr Heath was prime minister and only made us go to school three days a week. Of course, we were free to roam the streets without fear, unlike today’s forcibly school-deprived youngsters; plus, indoors, the TV was rarely on. Kids’ programmes – practically any programmes apart from the lunchtime news and Watch with Mother – didn’t start on the BBC until 4pm. Except in school holidays when there were long mornings of extra shows – and that, in this time of coronavirus, is what I’m attempting to recreate. Look back at the BBC One schedules for school Easter holidays in 1973, and they’re practically the same as Easter 1976. Likewise summer holidays, and Saturday mornings. I’d venture the Beeb only owned about a dozen kids’ series, which it played in rotation. Every holiday. For years. Searching YouTube for the theme tunes brought it all flooding back. If you liked your children’s TV in English, you could enjoy Daktari, about a vet in east Africa starring Clarence the cross-eyed lion, Casey Jones, about a wild west train driver, Champion the Wonder Horse (wild west heroics of a boy and a wild nag), Whirlybirds (helicopter pilots for hire), Banana Splits, or the homegrown fun of The Double Deckers (starring a young Peter Firth and Aswad’s Brinsley Forde). The rest – perhaps reflecting a national mood to join Europe – were dubbed efforts by our continental neighbours: Belle and Sebastian, a sort of modern Heidi with a cute boy and a white mountain rescue dog (after which the Scottish band named themselves); The Aeronauts, about a pair of swinging French air force pilots; White Horses, the one with the pretty girl on the ranch where they grow Lipizzaner horses; and The Flashing Blade, a swashbuckler about a French chevalier and a garrison besieged by an army in tin hats, possibly Spaniards (the historical context wasn’t immediately clear to a boy in Kent). These imported dramas spoke with one voice: because all the male parts sounded like they were dubbed into English by the same actor. If he got royalties every time they were shown, he’ll be in a mansion in Hampstead by now. Superior to all these, in my view, was the Franco-German masterpiece The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. I’ve got it on VHS in the loft. Over 13 episodes, it faithfully retells Daniel Defoe’s epic story of shipwreck, loneliness and the rescue of a companion, Friday, from the clutches of cannibals. By today’s standards, the pace is rather slow: its Austrian star, Robert Hoffman, bimbles about catching goats, or rigging up a rope bridge to his wrecked ship to salvage candelabras and barrels of rum. I was in the Cub Scouts back then, and I can tell you it was slow enough to keep up with his knotting technique. I’ve watched this Crusoe so many times I feel confident in my bones that, should I become shipwrecked, I’d be able to fashion a comfortable home out of poles and fronds with my eyes closed, using the very same knots. My DVD collection completes the rest of the schedule regulars: start with a Tom and Jerry cartoon, or Hergé’s Adventures of Tintin; practise survival with Robinson Crusoe; let off steam with Laurel and Hardy (check out Busy Bodies, The Music Box or Towed in a Hole); and end the morning with a classic Elvis Presley film. There’s more for the afternoon. Crazy times call for the madcap antics of The Monkees. Their show was pitched somewhere between that scene in the Beatles’ film Help! where they walk through separate front doors but end up in the same house, and the Sock! and Pow! of Batman. Wherever Batman would have a fight, the Monkees would sing a song and run around giddily. I didn’t know 50 years ago that David Jones, Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork and Michael Nesmith were a band stitched together in the head of a US television producer. I just thought their nitwit slapstick and corny jokes were hilarious; watching them now is only mildly excruciating. It’s been hours of fun catching up again with those childhood shows. But I’m saving the best till last, one more treat I’m keeping up my sleeve – or rather in the full DVD box set of 32 episodes – for deeper into lockdown times. The televisual light that has never dimmed for me shone, for once, on ITV. My favourite ever kids’ programme is Thunderbirds, best marionette-based, gadget-rich kids action drama of all time. Who wouldn’t want to work for International Rescue? It’s got futuristic flying machines, a funky pink Rolls-Royce driven by an ex-con butler, and an inventor called Brains. The team’s arch enemy is a psychic villain who lives in a Burmese temple and makes people faint when his eyes light up. And the stories go from rescues in space to, er, rescues from pyramids, underground rivers below Manhattan, crocodile-infested swamps, out-of-control monorails, nuclear-powered airliners, a ski resort in the Alps … in that last one, an episode called The Cham-Cham, Lady Penelope sings a tune Dietrich-style, with a hidden code that foils a dastardly attack by communist jet fighters! You’ll never top that, Nickelodeon."
"“The main story in America right now, like most days for the past five years, is Donald J Trump,” said Trevor Noah from his couch on Tuesday’s Daily Social Distancing Show. “Ever since this epidemic began, he’s been desperate for it to miraculously resolve itself. He downplayed its severity, he said it would vanish magically in April, and lately he’s been promoting the drug chloroquine as a miracle cure.” That drug hasn’t been tested, and any evidence of its effectiveness is anecdotal. But it’s essential for people with conditions such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, and the shortage caused by Trump’s words is “so frustrating, man”, said Noah. “You know what we need to do with Donald Trump? The same way they bleep out curse words in rap videos, they need to start bleeping out Trump’s misinformation at his press briefings.” The president has also said he wants to reassess shutdowns after two weeks of quarantine. “But, what quarantine?” Noah retorted. “Two-thirds of the American population hasn’t even been quarantined. People have been out at bars, restaurants, beaches the whole time. So, what are we reassessing after the 15 days? We’re just going to go back to normal after doing a half-ass job? “Because some of us have been flattening the curve,” he said, gesturing to his apartment. “But you guys realize the curve can unflatten too … it’s like eating healthy. After a week, you start feeling yourself, you see results. And you’re like, ‘Oh, this is great, I can eat ice-cream again,’ and then boom – the curve is back. “Look people, if we go back to doing nothing, the number of deaths from coronavirus could be in the millions,” Noah concluded. “And the problem with these numbers sometimes is that we think of them as numbers. Think of everybody in your life: if I said to you, ‘You could lose one or two family members,’ would you be able to choose who?” It’s not just coronavirus patients – a run on the hospitals would endanger anyone who needs medical care. “The simplest way to think of it is this: you know how the internet crashes every time Kim Kardashian releases a new butt pic? Now imagine if she decided to release a hundred butt pics in one day. The internet would crash so hard it would delete itself and we’d go back to the stone age.” On his 11th day of physical distancing at home, Jimmy Kimmel lamented how he has “been hearing how Shakespeare and Sir Isaac Newton came up with some of their greatest ideas while under quarantine during the plague”, he said. “That’s great – so far all I’ve discovered is you can slide a laundry basket down the stairs. But congratulations to them.” Meanwhile, “some of our thickest-headed politicians have been passing the time by spreading nonsense about the coronavirus – people like lieutenant governor of Texas Dan Patrick, who floated the idea that old people are willing to go to an early grave in order to help boost the stock market”. Earlier this week, Patrick told the Fox News host Tucker Carlson that grandparents would be OK dying to protect the American economy. “If that’s the exchange, I’m all in,” he said. “And that doesn’t make me noble or brave or anything like that.” “No, it makes you an idiot,” Kimmel retorted. “I shouldn’t say it makes you an idiot; it reveals to us that you are an idiot. “Unfortunately, the lieutenant governor isn’t alone in this moronathon; the president of the United States also appears to be planting the seeds to a get back to work movement,” Kimmel continued, pointing to Trump’s press conference on Tuesday in which he claimed the country will be up and running again by Easter. “By Easter? That’s in two and a half weeks!” Kimmel said. “Even Jesus is like, ‘Jesus! Calm down. Let’s think this through.’” On his second day back to an at-home Late Night, Seth Meyers said his team was still working out the kinks in producing a remote show. “Shoutout to YouTubers who’ve been doing this a long time and making us pros look like real dopes this week,” he said. “I tip my cap.” In lieu of his usual Closer Look segment, Meyers offered a bit called Jokes Seth Can’t Tell: “Here’s the premise, you guys: we do a lot of jokes on our show that, due to having a diverse writing staff, some of them don’t sound right coming from me, a straight white man.” So Meyers invited two of his writers, Amber Ruffin (“I’m black!” she said as her intro) and Jenny Hagel (“I’m gay!”), to tell the jokes for him. Ruffian and Hagel riffed on a range of topics, including the new documentary on the race to put a black man in space (“A black astronaut is just like a white astronaut, except his boots are spotless,” said Ruffian), Sephora (Hagel: “‘That’s where I buy my new makeup!’ said lesbians about Walgreens”), and Gwyneth Paltrow’s vagina-scented candle (“Said a lesbian coming home to her wife *sniffs* … are you cheating on me?”). Ruffin also revealed her plan to vote on election day: “The same way all black people vote: I’m gonna call in sick, drive 50 miles to my nearest polling place, have the lady tell me my name is not on the list, insist that it is, show her my voter-registration card, shut her up, stand in line for seven hours, and then vote for someone who may or may not keep their promises to black people. That’s democracy!”"
"Across Australian cities and towns, street lamp banners advertise exhibitions no one can attend and film festivals that will never happen. It has only taken days for the coronavirus to obliterate programs that took years to produce. Now in our increasingly empty streets, it’s as if these banners herald events scheduled to take place in some parallel universe. In that parallel universe, Torch the Place – the play I wrote for the Melbourne Theatre Company – would’ve wrapped up its sold-out season this week. We’d be celebrating closing night. Instead our actors are taking curtain calls on Instagram and we’re asking ticket holders who missed out to consider donating their ticket to cover costs and keep the theatre alive. Our production is one of the lucky ones. On Wednesday, Melbourne Theatre Company cancelled its next six productions. Melbourne international comedy festival has closed its curtains. Sydney’s Vivid festival has switched off its lights. Programmers, directors and producers haven’t made the right decision. They’ve made the only decision. What we’re left with – at last count – is at least 255,000 events now cancelled across Australia, with an estimated combined income loss of $280m. With coronavirus cases only anticipated to climb – now projected to peak in August 2020 – the only thing guaranteed is that those eye-watering losses to the arts will deepen. One person who’s felt that loss personally is my friend and colleague Patrick Howard, a Sydney-based freelance theatre artist. On the day Australia banned “non-essential” gatherings of over 100 people, Patrick had two hours of phone calls, emails and Zoom video conferences in which his remaining wages for 2020 disappeared. What hurt more was that 2020 was to be the first year Patrick finally pulled off working full-time as an artist. When I ask if he’s tallied up his lost earnings yet, he laughs grimly and says he’d been avoiding it. But he’s done the sums for me now. All up, he lost $32,000 in those two hours alone. It doesn’t matter what sector we work in and where we live: no human being will be left untouched by Covid-19 by the time it finishes boiling its way through our communities. In the meantime, we’re in survival mode. After taking stock of whether we have enough toilet paper, groceries and medical supplies, our next instinct is to seek comfort – anything to settle our heart rate and combat the stultifying dread and silence of self-isolation. And we always find that comfort in the arts. Video games? The arts. Comfort novels? The arts. Streaming TV? The arts. Podcasts? The arts. Chillout music? The arts. In our most dire hours, art keeps us sane, lights the dark and ensures we stay human. Even now, artists are stepping up to help us and their colleagues by entertaining us for free. At last weekend’s Isolaid festival, 76 Australian musicians played free 20-minute sets to raise money not for themselves, but for industry non-profit Support Act; globally, Moses Sumney and Robbie Williams have been doing live karaoke, classical music organisations are streaming online concerts, and Madonna is doing spoken word from her bath. We rely on the arts, but in Australia, conservative governments have had a consistent allergy to funding it robustly, often happily cutting funds and resources with the implication the arts are some luxurious indulgence. Only last December, the Morrison government folded the arts department entirely and absorbed it into a portfolio that didn’t even bear its name: the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications. That department also oversees road and rail. All world governments now are in a state of desperate triage, but some have immediately stepped up for the arts. New Zealand quickly announced multimillion-dollar help for artists. When Germany neared 1,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the culture minister immediately promised financial assistance. Canada budgeted to pay musicians $1,000 grants to livestream gigs. Australia is following suit, to a modest extent. Some state and territory governments have announced new initiatives to support artists and organisations, but the federal government is still missing in action. Meanwhile, Australian airlines are scheduled to receive a $715m bailout. And while it’s never fair to directly compare sectors, it’s worth noting Australian airlines contribute an estimated $18.42bn to the Australian economy every year. According to the government’s own figures, Australian arts and culture contributes $111.7bn over the same period. How we can best support artists and the arts will become clearer in the weeks and months ahead. Already it’s likely your local independent bookshop offers free delivery within certain postcodes, with staff delivering books by bicycle. We should pay musicians directly for their music instead of streaming it. Bandcamp recently waived fees for 24 hours to ensure artists got all the money directly. In the meantime, Patrick Howard is administering paperwork for Centrelink and preparing to move from Sydney to his parents’ place in the country. His recommendation? Check in on your friends who work in the arts. “Make sure they’re OK,” he says. “We’re quite sensitive people, always on the brink of disaster. And now it’s really hit.” In times of crisis, humans turn to art for help. It’s vital we help the arts through – and on the other side of – this. For those of us fortunate enough to come out of this physically unharmed, it’s likely our mental health will be shattered. The arts will help. Staying indoors and washing our hands will help us survive. Protecting the arts will help us live."
"It is the year 2364, and Jean-Luc Picard – the revered captain of the USS Enterprise – has just come face to face with three humans who have been frozen in time since the late 20th century. By this point in the story – the 1988 finale of the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation – he has met Klingons, Romulans, a pool of black goo, but nothing is as alien as these greedy, selfish relics. This is Star Trek, after all: the pop-culture behemoth built on the idealistic future envisioned in the 60s by its creator Gene Roddenberry. “A lot has changed in the past 300 years,” Picard tells them. “People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We’ve eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We’ve grown out of our infancy.” Or have we? Revisiting the character 30 years later in Star Trek: Picard, Patrick Stewart’s grand return to the role at the age of 79, it seems the world has not progressed as much as we were led to believe. Set during a time in which the Federation – a union of planets with shared democratic values and interests – has turned isolationist in response to a terror attack, it has proved to be a divisively dark, gritty and morally bleak take on the Star Trek universe. Episode five opens with a beloved character screaming as his eye is ripped out of his skull. In another scene, a Starfleet admiral tells Picard – the great, heroic captain Picard, a man whose voice is built like a beautiful cathedral – to “shut the fuck up”. The reaction, understandably, has been mixed. Some fans welcome Star Trek being brought up to date with the look and feel of contemporary television. Others maintain that such pessimism is at odds with what makes Star Trek Star Trek. The showrunner Michael Chabon, responding to questions via his Instagram page, defended Picard against the latter claim by saying that “shadow defines light”, that “if nothing can rock the Federation’s perfection, then it’s just a magical land”. It is a sentiment that has been echoed in the past by Alex Kurtzman, the showrunner of the other ongoing series set in the same universe, Star Trek: Discovery. He justified its equally violent, profane and dark sensibility by maintaining that modern Star Trek is simply a reflection of its time. We live in an age defined by the post-truth possibilities of social media, the uncertain future of automation, rising inequality, increased rightwing populism, the spectre of climate change and, of course, the fact that we are living through a pandemic with the potential to be the most significant and traumatic period of our history since the second world war. Picard certainly reflects many of these concerns. It is little wonder that some of the most popular science-fiction TV of the last 20 years – from the technophobia of Black Mirror to the post-9/11 anxieties of Battlestar Galactica – is not exactly enthused about the future. Yet the idea that the grittiness of shows such as Picard makes it mature and relevant, while the ethos of yesteryear Star Trek is now naive or too old-fashioned to survive, feels misjudged. The hope, optimism and sincerity of the original 60s series was in itself a radical act: a way of portraying the future as it should be (a multiracial cast in a time of civil rights struggle; peace and cooperation in a time of nuclear terror), rather than merely wallowing in things as they were. In the 90s, the darker spin-off show Deep Space Nine pre-empted Picard’s themes by 27 years, asking what happens when the principles of the Federation are compromised by war. The difference was that Deep Space Nine, much like the best of Star Trek, managed to balance its meatier themes of PTSD, faith and wartime atrocities with episodes where everyone got dressed up to visit a holographic version of 60s Las Vegas. It is this, more than anything else, that is fundamentally lacking from modern Star Trek: a sense of tonal texture, a spirit of curiosity about different worlds and cultures, and the crackling chemistry of a warm and interesting crew. Instead, as is the case with Picard, its new characters have felt like broadly drawn “badasses” at best and, at worst, downright cold and unlikable. The prime example being Michelle Hurd’s new addition Raffi: the wise-cracking ex-Starfleet officer who insists on calling Picard “JL” (instead of Jean-Luc), and can often be seen vaping. The limited length of the series, which – like so much streaming TV – plays out almost as one 10-hour story, is also a factor. The benefit of 20-odd-episode seasons in which a crew of characters is faced with a different problem every week lies not only in the soap opera-style comfort of coming to think of a crew as family, but also in the potential to experiment with a variety of different stories and themes. The focus of Picard and Discovery tends to be so narrow that the universe ends up feeling smaller, less alive and less interesting. And yet the appetite of modern audiences for that bygone era of Star Trek storytelling still exists. Just take the popularity of one of the strangest things on TV: The Orville. Originally trailed as Seth MacFarlane’s Family Guy-esque parody of Star Trek-style sci-fi, it has instead revealed itself as a trojan horse for his at-times entirely sincere Star Trek: The Next Generation fan-fiction, featuring MacFarlane cosplaying as the dashing captain of his very own Enterprise. Its aesthetics are similar, its stories are similar, it is clearly based around Roddenberry’s ethos of exploration and optimism. There are even episodes written and directed by 90s Star Trek writers and directors. As we all cower in our homes for fear of a threat that we cannot see, a dose of optimism about the future would be more appreciated than ever. But, sadly, all we are left with is a choice between Star Trek that doesn’t really feel like Star Trek at all, or a dodgy covers band playing the greatest hits. What a fate for a once-great franchise."
"Way to rip up the rule book, while also respecting it more than ever! This series finale takes audacious flights, rewriting Doctor Who lore to extravagant degrees, creating an alternative backstory for the creation of Gallifrey and a completely new backstory for the Doctor, that reveals her as the fabled Timeless Child: not the last of the Timelords, but the first. Jodie Whittaker gives one of her most visceral performances, as the Doctor learns the truth about her origins – and her part in the much-storied malevolence of the Timelords. Everything changes ... and yet as is always the case with this show, nothing really changes. The Doctor is still an unknowable force of nature with a shady past. And, just when it looks like things might really get shaken up, the Doctor is once again prevented from committing genocide by kindly terrorist Ko Shamur. Because a finale needs pace as well as tension, there’s an amusing subplot by the Cybermen advance back on the ship, as Yaz, Graham and the rest of the humans come up with the ruse of disguising themselves in Cyber armour (human remains and all). It’s a pretty dim Cyber-army that falls for that if you ask me, but it works, reuniting Team Tardis on Gallifrey. All setting up a zinger of a cliffhanger, which sees the Doctor’s past lives come home to roost as she’s carted off as a fugitive by the Judoon to spend forever on a prison ship. Well that, as several of you say, was no Robot of Sherwood. Hot Camp Master does at least have dialogue that almost stands up to Steven Moffat’s divine writing of Missy. I especially appreciated the Apprentice reference. Sacha Dhawan also gets more to do this time, the leaping around dialled down just a tickle to convey a deeply damaged character with some gravitas. It has made the character even madder to discover that his nemesis, the Doctor, is intrinsically bound up in his DNA. And all the more deliciously horrible to take such delight in her being indirectly culpable for genocide. I’m going to say it out loud – this could be the most malevolent Master the show has yet seen. Fittingly, the guy has not only a wet room but a torture chamber in the basement. As ever with this character, his intention is little more than destruction and dominion, but we’ve learned to live with that over the years. Here’s a knotty one. The hot gossip all series was that Team Tardis were going to be ripped apart. Which is half true – the Doctor does send them home to save them and (she thinks) sacrifice herself. So presumably they have to believe that that’s the end of it. But there’s no big exit storyline for anyone – and it’s been confirmed that Bradley, Mandip and Tosin will all at least be back for the festive special. But the elephant in the publicity department remains Tosin’s casting in that big US drama. No announcements yet, but it’s surely impossible for him to commit to both. I mentioned last week that the Cybermen had got their groove back, even though they’re somewhat sidelined this week. But it needs to be said, those Cyber-Timelord hybrid creations of the Master were daft. If you’re going for ultimate dominion of the universe, at least do it with some elegance. As predicted, there’s no explanation offered as to how Missy survived the events of The Doctor Falls and became Hot Camp Master. But previous showrunner Steven Moffat has suggested that that’s no bad thing. “I don’t necessarily want all the gaps to be plugged,” he told the Radio Times. “Kids out there are making up their own stories about how Missy escaped that place and regenerated into Sacha. They’re doing their own version of it. And that’s much more exciting”. What we do know is that the Master always survives, so don’t expect to have seen the last of him. We’ve got a wait on our hands for another series, but the good news is that Doctor Who will return during the festive season (presumably on New Year’s Day again) in the classically titled Revolution of the Daleks. As ever, thank you so much for all your comments, you crazy lot. Until we meet again ..."
"Back in the late 90s, when I lived in London, the UK was in the EU, Tony Blair had led Labour to a landslide win, rave music was roaring out of clubs, in-yer-face theatre was all the rage, the National Theatre had a bias for the classics and standing ovations were a rarity. Much has changed two decades on. When I saw five shows in London last week, I realised there had been some major unheralded shifts in the key themes of contemporary English playwriting, which now mainly focus on British identity post-Brexit. Death of England, by Clint Dyer and Roy Williams, is a relentlessly pungent new play about mourning and identity, seen from an individual and a national perspective. “Let’s face some facts: we are shit, we are shit at everything! Because England now is nothing but an island of shit,” declares Michael, the play’s sole character. It’s in-yer-face theatre meets Pinter in an exploration of angry nationalism and inner turbulence thanks to Rafe Spall’s demonic, blusterous delivery. It was bold of Rufus Norris to produce such an explosively provocative play at the National, but this seems to be exactly the kind of theatre audiences crave now: political plays that speak out the truth for people who feel they have been abandoned by their leaders; plays that put up a mirror for the audiences to look into and engage in some courageous self-reflection. Death of England reminds me of an astonishing new Greek play called Sleep, Stella, Sleep, directed and written by cinematographer Yannis Economides. It poignantly delineates the deformities and malfunctions of Greek society that led to the crisis ravaging the country for more than a decade. Focusing on the dismantled bonds among family members and the dominance of a beastly patriarchal figure, Economides’s play, like Death of England, sheds light on the ailing cell of the family, which contaminates its individuals and, in turn, society. From the Garden of Eden to Chekhov’s Cherry Orchard, gardens allude to life, nations or the state of being. In Mike Bartlett’s play Albion, the garden is a clear metaphor for England itself. Audrey (a dazzling Victoria Hamilton) is keen on regenerating a neglected green space in rural England. “This is a major project of national importance,” Audrey admits, only to realise a few months later that “there are some things that can’t be restored”. It’s the gardener of the estate, the withering Matthew – impeccably portrayed by Geoffrey Freshwater – who insists on delivering the final line of the play: “A rose. We have to keep it.” Is it a metaphor for England, cut off from the garden of the European Union and destined to dry up and perish?  The Greek equivalent to Albion is a new robust work called Agrios Sporos (Wild Seed) by Giannis Tsiros. The wild seed of the title is a palpable metaphor for the pre- and post-crisis Greek who can develop roots in every single “soil” and survive against all odds.  As in Athens, the name of the game in London theatres in 2020 is diversity. In London you can opt for a West End musical such as the feelgood show Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, or Temi Wilkey’s jolly family drama The High Table, in which two British Nigerian women decide to get married and invoke their ancestral spirits to bless their union. If somebody wishes to encounter an all-British theatre experience, Witness for the Prosecution by Agatha Christie is the show to choose. Where once it was politicians who faced each other across the imposing chamber of London’s County Hall, now it is QCs Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Myers who battle against each other to prove the innocence or guilt of Leonard Vole. In Athens, you can choose among several courtroom dramas, including the immaculately structured 12 Angry Men at the Alkmini and the interactive Terror at Athinon – where the audience functions as the jury. If you look for the equivalent of Jamie Lloyd’s auspiciously deconstructed Cyrano de Bergerac in Athens, head for the Swedish classic The Father at the Apothiki, awesomely reimagined by director Vassilis Bisbikis. In Athens there are 1,500 shows to choose from, with tickets priced from €10 to €25, whereas in London tickets range from £20 to £200. More and more shows in Athenian venues are played with English subtitles but unlike the British habit of eating and drinking during the show, food and drinks are not allowed in Greek theatre venues while the show is on.  What’s the difference between a British comedy critic and a French one? The latter was out of professional luck long before the decline of newspapers. Writing about comedy isn’t really a job description in France, where the popularity of standup is very much a 21st-century thing. Before the mid-2000s, French comedians mostly favoured character-driven vignettes, led by prominent impersonators as well as such troupes as 1980s favourites Les Inconnus and Les Nuls. Even the recent boom of English-style standup in France hasn’t led to renewed critical examination of the genre, which tends to be seen in highbrow circles as just a bit of fun. So when the Guardian, in an effort to promote the free movement of banter, looked for a French critic to weigh in on British standup specials, they settled on me – a theatre writer whose main claim to comedy expertise is many a Christmas spent watching the beloved 1979 play-turned-film Santa Claus Is a Stinker, a French classic that involves a character being chopped to pieces in the bathroom of a depression helpline’s offices. While I’m told the British comedy scene is in rude health, not much of it has reached France since Monty Python and Mr Bean. I’ll admit the only active British comedian that came to mind was John Oliver, and he has been based in the US since the mid-00s. In my defence, there are practical hurdles for French viewers hoping to hone some British-style quips. Netflix France only offers a small number of the specials available to watch in the UK; many specials turned out to have been produced by the BBC, whose programmes are notoriously hard to access from abroad. As a result, while American comedians such as Amy Schumer and Ali Wong are now fixtures on Netflix’s list of suggestions for French subscribers, few viewers are likely to come across Bridget Christie or Gina Yashere. It’s a shame, because a week’s exposure to them and some of their peers left me wanting more. There is a craft to British comedy that speaks to its longer history, and to the competition standups presumably face to make their mark on a crowded scene. Most routines were impressively paced, building on the natural rhythm of British speech; French intonation, which is much more even, doesn’t quite allow for the same musical variations. If you’d asked me beforehand to come up with a police sketch of a British comedian, it would have looked a lot like James Acaster, whose Netflix-produced Repertoire is available in France. He is lanky and self-deprecating, and the storylines holding these four shows together would be too surreal for most French comedians. Starting a performance on his knees? Pretending to be an undercover cop posing as a comic? Spinning an entire hour out of jury duty on a murder case? It’s masterful storytelling in addition to absurd fun, and clever enough to satisfy the most intellectual audience. Even his quip that he loves French cuisine and “that’s why this story takes place in a Pret a Manger” works in France now, since Pret has taken over the Paris high street. The level of deprecation I saw is fascinating from a French perspective because, as a country, we’re just not very good at taking the piss out of ourselves. Many local comedians are masters of the humblebrag, as a way to come out of a vulnerable moment and still look cool. They wouldn’t be caught dead as Sarah Millican’s adventurous sex-averse persona in Thoroughly Modern Millican, yet her warm, mischievous relationship with her audiences is a joy to follow. Her Geordie accent has a sing-song unpretentiousness that is also easier to latch on to as a foreigner than, say, John Bishop’s Scouse, which left me puzzling over some jokes. While French humour tends to be more risque (if you don’t know what that means, just watch Blanche Gardin on Netflix), there is much to love in the unabashed progressiveness of a number of British standups. Christie pulls no punches in Stand Up for Her, and her feminist observations hit home, from her take on Adam and Eve to a skit about an audition for a yoghurt advert that involved a man waiting for a woman inside her fridge. Yashere’s bluntness – whether she is describing her snoring or asserting that “we all see colour, otherwise we’d all be walking around dressed like clowns” – is a core part of her appeal. They understand that taking a clear stand doesn’t have to spoil the fun – a notion that France is still grappling with. The cities we Berlin teens wanted to live in were always British: London, Manchester, Bristol – those were the places our favourite bands came from. At the end of the 90s – before the no-frills airlines started – I finally made it to London thanks to a school exchange program. We rode around in the signature red buses looking for record stores and indie clubs, although we had barely any money and everything was incredibly expensive. As teenagers, we took every flyer and free magazine we could get our hands on and brought it home to decorate our bedroom walls, because we loved British music. Almost all Germans did. It all started with the Beatles – the Hamburgers fell in love with them and the whole Bundesrepublik followed. Even in East Germany, where I grew up, two Beatles albums were released, and it felt as if every GDR citizen had them in their tiny record collection. Today, every music magazine and all the so-called experts still rate them as the best band ever. From the Beatles onward, Britain heavily influenced musical development in Germany. Punk in the late 70s, postpunk and new wave in the 80s, trip-hop in the 90s: it all washed in from the UK. Finally, there was Britpop. Round here there was no such thing as fan fights over Blur v Oasis – if you were in to Oasis you also liked Blur, because it was the same genre. In hindsight, it seems like almost every British band in the 90s was cool, just because they were British: Pulp, the Verve, Manic Street Preachers, Supergrass, Suede. These days are hard times for old Britpop fans. Some journalists (including from the Guardian) blame Britpop for Brexit, arguing that it flew the national flag for nostalgia. Without question, some of our British musical heroes have fallen, the most famous being Morrissey. We all loved him. Farin Urlaub, singer with punk band Die Ärzte, even dedicated a famous song – Sumisu – to him that translated as: “Whenever we were sad – and we were sad pretty often – we went home and listened to the Smiths.” The song describes the relationship between teenagers in the 80s and Morrissey. We were sure he was left-wing, just like us – so he alarmed fans with what he said in an interview with Der Spiegel two years ago: “If you try to make everything multicultural, you will not have any culture in the end,” and “I feel sad that Germany has become the rape capital of Europe … it coincides with the open borders and the free flow.” We were like: WTF? Aren’t open borders and multicultural movements a gain for every music scene, and for culture above all? Disappointed and in disagreement, we needed other bands to listen to. Although we aren’t sad any more, we’re often angry, and who can we turn to? The UK. British rap is much more political than most German hip-hop, which is also angry, but often in a sexist or racist way. By contrast, Nothing Great About Britain by Slowthai is an album that deals with Brexit and nationalism with intelligence, humour and aggression. And there is Dave, who just called Boris Johnson a racist at the Brit awards. Or Kate Tempest who sings: “Europe is lost, America lost, London lost / Still we are clamouring victory”. There are exciting punk bands such as Idles, or bands that defy genre, such as the great Sleaford Mods. They are all admired. Even though there are still British superstars such as Adele, Ed Sheeran or Amy Winehouse (always in our hearts!), there is no such thing as “British music” any more. These days it doesn’t matter where musicians come from. You love them because of their image, their quirks, their personality and of course their music, but none of this is bound to a national style or character. That is no Brexit-related phenomenon – it is a global development. Thanks to the internet you have access to billions of songs and artists. Music is on your phone, your laptop, everywhere you want. And it could be from any country. So London isn’t the place of our dreams any more. It’s too expensive, too boring, too fancy, too sleek. Today, in cities around the world – even in gentrified Berlin – we find clubs that are more exciting and gigs that are more mind-blowing. Maybe because by now, many international and multicultural artists have moved there – among them the British. I’m a child of communist-era Poland. Born in 1982, I recall the acute scarcity of 1980s –– and the periodic shocks of visits to the affluent west. I was born to a teacher mum and a doctor dad: the first in their families to have had a university education. My great-grandparents were dirt-poor farmers in the countryside with no electricity. I teach film studies at the University of Warsaw and that’s largely due to the huge social advancement made possible by the communist welfare state –– one that I hate for having destroyed civic virtue in Poland, and yet one that I need to credit for making me who I am. Nobody said being Polish was simple. After communism fell in 1989, class became a dirty word. Poverty in Polish film, if portrayed at all, had an almost metaphysical heft to it: no film-maker dared to explore its causes in government policies. One was either “successful”, or thrown on to the trash heap of doomed deprivation. Had it been not for the British cinema of Ken Loach and Mike Leigh, Polish audiences in the 1990s would have forgotten what class meant. We were drawn to films such as Riff-Raff, Raining Stones and Secrets and Lies. With their focus on working-class characters full of vitality, these films offered a freshness missing from our cinema. Years later, I understood where that affinity and respect for the everyday life of the disenfranchised stemmed from. A moment in Lindsay Anderson’s brilliant Every Day Except Christmas never fails to move me: the film-makers thank their subjects (porters at Covent Garden market) for being who they are and doing what they do. In Poland, the class alienation of the late 1990s was near-total: the urban intelligentsia aspired instead to Woody Allen’s New York City, where each night seemed to bring a new gallery opening , intellectual flights of fancy and erotic possibilities. The catastrophic process of shutting down vocational schools was triggered at the same time –– why produce workers when we can have intellectuals and business-people instead? At the same time, a similar betrayal of the working-class in the UK was being fiercely analysed in the work of Loach, Leigh, and others. We loved their films but we failed to recognise that we were following the same perilous path those works decried. Around 2004, many of my friends started emigrating to the UK. Just as many of us were finishing universities, Poles of my generation came to the realisation that even a menial job in the UK paid better and brought firmer prospects than a university degree could warrant in Poland. Our class consciousness grew sharply and rapidly. Now the EU door is being slammed shut. Just as the UK shows its less-welcoming face, Poland is undergoing a deep crisis of national unity, as populist politicians are tearing the social fabric apart by pitting citizens against each other (most recently by scapegoating the LGBTQ+ community). One ritual that didn’t change is that last year I went to see another movie by Ken Loach: Sorry We Missed You, about a package carrier with a precarious existence inside the nightmare of late capitalism. The voice of the 83-year-old British director felt as fresh as ever –– only this time, there was no mistaking that he was speaking of Polish experience, too. Ruefully, we had caught up to Loach’s vision. For me, British cinema remains exemplary in bringing class awareness to the fore while maintaining the highest artistic standards. The social sensitivity of films such as Joanna Hogg’s privilege-examining The Souvenir, Francis Lee’s God’s Own Country and Andrew Haigh’s Weekend is something I hope to see in Polish films one day. Paweł Pawlikowski’s Cold War, as beautiful as it is, historicises class struggle by placing its cross-class romance firmly in a black and white, 1:1.33-ratio. And yet our social reality is so deeply complex right now, it seems ripe for artistic exploration. Class tensions between Polish millennials and boomers are exploding. The urban and the rural areas are at sharp ideological odds. And then, there are the immigrant communities: most notably the Ukrainians, but also others. A gay British couple I know recently moved to a postindustrial city in Poland and are eagerly exploring the Polish artistic scene, even as one of them commutes daily to Warsaw to work for an international corporation. How I would long to see a film on people like them: carving out a space for themselves in a post-Brexit world and enriching Polish society by their presence. When it comes to my relationship with British culture, this whole article could simply be a list of the iconic bands and singers the UK gave us. Or it could be a list of film directors, artists, writers or historical sites. My mum’s favourite band was the Beatles, my dad’s the Rolling Stones. These days, we play grime at parties. With more than 200,000 Lithuanians settled in the UK, British culture is intertwined with almost every family in Lithuania. So for those of us reading the news on our smartphones on the morning of 24 June 2016, during the Midsummer weekend – the most celebrated festival after Christmas in the Baltics – it was one of the most bizarre, surreal, hard-to-believe experience we’ve ever had. Dark uncertainty crept in about the Britain we thought we knew, and stayed there, growing. I briefly lived in London, and often visit the UK to install shows by Pakui Hardware, the artistic duo that I run with Ugnius Gelguda. To me, experiencing British culture was like being inside Zadie Smith’s White Teeth: dense, transgressive, ironic, full of friction and with intriguing chance encounters. Despite struggling to cover their ever-increasing rents and public transport tickets, contemporary artists, curators and writers have clung to London for its dynamism, its compulsive attraction and also its indifference to who you are. The city’s anonymity – animosity almost – brought people together in order to survive. There, acquaintances grew into friendships, friendships grew into communities, communities into art spaces, organisations, and advocacy groups. These smaller community-driven organisations actively pointed to, criticised and took action on faulty points of the status quo of the art world, forcing even large-scale institutions to change their funding and mediation policies in London and other British cities. Here we stumble on the most obvious and prevalent problem today not only in the UK, but the world in general: the urban-rural divide. The British culture I’ve been discussing proliferates in cities – which serve as havens for outsiders, “deviants” from the norm. Rural areas cultivate a more homogenous, white version of British culture. No wonder nationalism and protectionism have been exponentially growing over the past couple of decades, and with the help of populist politicians, are thriving today. It is precisely this conservative, enclosed and frankly dangerous “culture” that has proliferated and been elevated in Britain after Brexit. Immediately after the Brexit deal was signed, the first signs of open and normalised hostility towards anyone and anything that does not comply with this new identity politics spilled out immediately, for instance on the BBC’s Question Time. Not to mention the recently passed policy on performers’ visas, making it increasingly difficult to maintain a dynamic and vital cultural exchange between the UK and the rest of the world. It is immensely sad, not only for us foreigners, but to also see British artists devastated by those surreal and dark shifts in their country. This summer, in July, Ugnius Gelguda and I will have our first institutional solo show in the UK at Baltic centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead. “Finally something Baltic in Baltic,” commented some after we announced this news. It’s not going to be the first Baltic-Baltic exchange, however – a few of our artists have already been presented there. It only shows how vibrant the cultural exchange between Britain and other countries has been. This vital flow of cultures, of people, of ideas is what constitutes British culture. At least in my view. Please don’t build a dam to stop it. Build dikes to protect the island from rising sea levels. Naturally it was Phoebe Waller-Bridge who was the last piece of the puzzle, confirming that it’s fine to talk dirty and be something of a monster, as long as you do it with a British accent.  Like so many others around the world, I am obsessed with Fleabag – season two was last year’s best TV after Chernobyl. That Waller-Bridge’s series isn’t more successful in Sweden is partly the fault of Amazon for not investing enough time and money here, and partly the fault of the majority of Swedish TV viewers: they’re just not ready for a new wave of challenging, genre-bending British television. Of course, that last sentence is prejudicial, but still, the facts remain: here in the north, new episodes of Midsomer Murders attract far more viewers than a new season of Line of Duty. It’s weird, I know. There have been some successes over the years, obviously. Downton Abbey was a big hit in Sweden – I’ve never had so many angry emails as when I wrote about Matthew Crawley’s necessary death. The success of The Crown also showed that the Swedish crowd are still hungry for British costume dramas. For a long time it was through SVT, the Swedish equivalent of the BBC, that the best British shows got a window here. Nowadays it’s easier, with Netflix, HBO Nordic, Amazon and others., which have allowed us to discover and enjoy Bodyguard, Sex Education, the wonderful Derry Girls and the fantastic first season of The End of the F*** ing World. But still, I envy you. When The Bridge was broadcast, the show’s creator Hans Rosenfeldt and I often talked about how difficult it is to write dialogue for interrogation scenes. You have the master of that in Jed Mercurio. You also have two of the very best in Waller-Bridge and Sally Wainwright, and you take better care of and value scriptwriters more than in Sweden. Still, and I write this with respect: I loathe Britannia and get tired just thinking about The Stranger on Netflix. Also, what painful disappointments Catherine the Great, Dracula and A Christmas Carol were. Around the world, more and more shows are produced and the ones that dare to push boundaries and test new, surprising ways to win viewers’ hearts are fewer and fewer – even if there is more TV than ever before. In this regard, and with a few exceptions, it is surprising that British television isn’t at the forefront globally. Sure, not everything can be as smart as Killing Eve, as brave as Top Boy or as humanly funny and tragic as Catastrophe. But when British TV is great it is really great: as a TV critic, I would love to see a new show that I can’t stop thinking about and, like Fleabag, want to analyse to pieces. I want something that melts my heart and brings tears to my eyes of either laughter or sorrow. And well, it’s bound to happen, since Brits can say almost anything and still make it sound polite and charming."
"Images of empty museums, cinemas, concert halls and galleries across the country are quickly becoming emblems of our changing life. And this weekend there is fresh speculation that the world’s biggest arts festival in Edinburgh will not take place this August. The end of live performance and public cultural activity is one of the most comprehensive of the myriad shocks to the British economy, as well as to a sense of normality. Theatre doors were closed by a puritanical English regime in 1642, but this total shutdown covers every form of shared entertainment and built heritage. And what now worries the country’s arts institutions is how this world-beating resource can be protected during lockdown. The lights began to go out in the West End of London last Monday when the prime minister classed theatres and cinemas among places to avoid. The Old Vic, where Daniel Radcliffe was starring, reluctantly brought down the curtain first. Almost every other production and solo show in the land followed. From the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-on-Avon and the opera house in Covent Garden to a popular touring production of Helen Forrester’s work By the Waters of Liverpool, the news was the same. The sentiments of Rob Fennah, this new show’s writer and co-producer, were typical: “We’re not going to let this get the better of us. We will relaunch early next year, bigger, bolder and as glorious as ever!” As Boris Johnson was speaking, almost a week ago, thousands of actors, musicians and comedians were still preparing to perform. At London’s small and unsubsidised Jermyn Street Theatre, a highly acclaimed new production of Shakespeare’s The Tempest, with veteran star Michael Pennington, went on with the director reading a part played by an actor who had suddenly been put into isolation by new symptoms. On Tuesday, a final performance was filmed without an audience. In Eastbourne, the cast of Alan Bennett’s The Habit of Art, starring Matthew Kelly, swiftly organised a similar filmed performance on Wednesday. The actors did not want to walk away without a record. From self-isolation, Melvyn Bragg told the Observer it would be difficult for artists to boost general morale, as Myra Hess did during the war by playing piano in the National Gallery. “It is much worse than what we know of the blitz, sadly,” said Lord Bragg. “Theatres did not all shut in the blitz. This is a different thing altogether because performers are endangering everyone.” The government’s initial advice to the public prompted anger from many commentators.The playwright Lucy Prebble said that it was unfair to leave the decision up to imperilled arts companies and venues. “What a dereliction of duty,” she argued on Twitter, “to pass on the decision to confused small business owners, performers and consumers.” The Society of London Theatre, having been forced to cancel the Olivier awards, spoke on Friday on behalf of the major booking companies to reassure those with tickets. Everyone will be contacted with a credit note or refund, it promised: “There is nothing you need to do.” Big-name comedians such as Rob Brydon have had to abort their touring schedules. “Refunds are available,” he announced on social media, “Let’s stay safe.” The reactions of such prominent stars are the most noticed, but well known names are at least often financially cushioned. Supporting cast and stage crew have nowhere to look for work. This weekend they may have been able to take some comfort from Rishi Sunak’s revised provisions to protect vulnerable businesses and those in rented homes. But the chancellor’s latest measures are not enough, according to Christine Payne, the general secretary of the actors’ union, Equity.  “Entertainment workers have been badly let down by the government,” she said. “The chancellor claims that ‘any employer’ will be eligible for the job retention scheme – not in our sector. Suspension of the universal credit minimum income floor and tax deferrals are a drop in the ocean compared to the losses experienced by our members, and fall far short of the support available to workers elsewhere in the economy. “We will fight on to put the case for our members who have provided billions in revenue for the UK but are not being protected in their hour of need.”​ Last week saw the cancellation of Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary festival, with headliners Paul McCartney and Taylor Swift asked to bide their time. Deposits already paid by fans were rolled over for a year. Eurovision is also over before it began. Yet both rock and classical musicians, denied access to an audience, have been among the first to react by trying to reach the public online. Singers including Rufus Wainwright have been posting solo performances recorded at home for fans, and on Friday the London Symphony Orchestra released details of Always Playing, a digital programme of concerts which will be streamed free on the LSO YouTube channel this month and next, replacing its scheduled performances at the Barbican in London. The Royal Opera House has also unveiled a selection of free ballets and operas available on its Facebook and YouTube channels. Perhaps the most unnerving cultural news for the wider population has been the production paralysis of filmed and televised drama, mainstays of the national conversation. Continuing series such as the BBC’s EastEnders and Holby, and Channel 4’s Hollyoaks, have either been paused or scaled down. ITV has changed the scheduling of Coronation Street and Emmerdale, but aims to continue filming in Manchester and Leeds “whilst carefully adhering to the latest health advice”. Postponed alongside Daniel Craig’s James Bond, who will not be operational again until next year, is Disney’s live-action remake of Mulan. But much of the entertainment impact will not be felt until next year, as filming of hit returning drama series including the BBC’s Peaky Blinders and Netflix’s The Crown and Stranger Things, has all halted, in addition to all major movie productions. Warner Brothers has suspended production on The Batman while another Disney live-action remake, The Little Mermaid, is now waiting indefinitely in the wings. In addition, Jurassic World: Dominion is no longer being filmed by Universal. Tom Hanks, perhaps the world’s highest-profile coronavirus sufferer, was to play “Colonel Tom” Parker in Baz Luhrmann’s biopic of Elvis Presley, but production stopped well before he and his wife could finish their period of isolation together in Australia. On Thursday, organisers of the Cannes film festival admitted defeat. The showcase on the Côte d’Azur has been shifted back to high summer at the earliest. In London, the British Film Institute’s Flare festival was also cancelled, although hopes that the main film festival can go ahead in October have survived. Also on the upside, several distributors are now releasing major films straight to streaming services. The new version of Jane Austen’s Emma and the sci-fi thriller The Invisible Man, both released in cinemas just three weeks ago, will be available on the small screen this week. Even the world of books has been affected, with the cancellation of the Hay festival. The annual event makes more than £20m for its host, Hay-on-Wye, but organisers have said they believe that skipping a year means its existence is threatened. Making an appeal for donations, Peter Florence, the director of Hay, said: “As we face these coming weeks of uncertainty and isolation we will work hard to carry forward our spirit of togetherness, and to share stories and ideas.” In the early stages of this crisis, the arts have become more than a symbol of national pain: they are a way to respond and to communicate, as well as a welcome distraction. Before performers and companies could check whether the chancellor’s new measures would help them, many were offering to perform online. Actors Samuel West and Lisa Dwan will read out requested work, while artists and music teachers have set up lessons. Book and film clubs have gone virtual. The BBC is to broadcast Culture in Quarantine, a virtual festival of the arts. The corporation’s head of arts, Jonty Claypole, explained: “For me, a precious ray of sunshine has emerged in the clear determination of artists, performers, curators and producers to keep creating and connecting with audiences.” Tristram HuntV&A directorWe all feel great sorrow. Our cultural role in civic society has had the rug pulled out from under it. But we had to respond to the dramatic escalation this week. There had been no clear message from government, but this situation is so hard and we’ve not had sight of the information the advisers are seeing, nor of what the consequences are. And, of course, we are an arms’ length national body and we normally like that. Initially we thought we had until the end of last week, so we operated a 50/50 system, with half the staff going in on alternate days, but we closed on Wednesday after the prime minister’s announcement. Since then I’ve been in meetings with our estates management team working out how to secure and look after this 160-year-old building and ensure the safety of a collection that belongs to everybody. Things are changing every day so we are constantly catching up. Staff are understandably anxious and full of confusion so the job was to try to be clear. We have made no redundancies, but we have had to work through our contractual obligations with events management and that kind of thingand the like. We are dealing with set designers and lighting designers, people who we don’t want to leave in the lurch. Our caterers and cleaners are part of large outside organisations which should be fairly stable I hope. We are now looking at giving more access to the collection online. Catherine MallyonRSC executive directorActors do live with uncertainty, like many other freelancers, but that is in the context of there being other work out there in the West End, or in regional theatre or on telly. This situation is materially different. We are like a family in a way, because actors are with the company for such a long time. So they have that support network and we have offered more, largely online. At Christmas our planners picked up on news of the spread of the virus and so we increased hygiene immediately. We thought we were likely to have to suspend, but we were not prepared for the sudden nature of it. On a day when there were performances at 7pm, 5.30pm was difficult. Now we are working around the clock to protect people and let them know what is happening, as we know it. We’ve given a reassurance we won’t leave anyone who was working unpaid. But we can’t do this for an unlimited length of time. We will work in staging posts towards reopening. We could take out a loan, but we wouldn’t have any income to repay it with after a certain point. It is going to have a huge effect on the whole economy of Stratford. Our digital content is going to be available to schools and we want to revive the shows that were in rehearsal, The Winter’s Tale and A Comedy of Errors. We hope we have not lost them. Kwame Kwei-ArmahYoung Vic artistic directorI did have a little cry on Tuesday. And then I thought, “How can I serve?” This pandemic shows us not only how fragile we are, but how fragile our whole economy is. We have told staff we will meet our payroll obligations, including to front-of-house staff, and look after our freelancers. No one knows how long this coronavirus pandemic will last, but we are looking at planning for three months to start with. We have closed down some of our discretionary expenditure straight away and sadly on Friday we closed down the building. We had wanted to keep it open as a place for people to come, and so we spaced out the seating and gave away free tea and coffee. We have modelled this now, so we can do it again in the future when it is needed. We have mothballed the premiere of our house music opera, Orfeus, and are looking for ways to bring it back, as well as to see if the production of Second Woman, which was to be part of the cancelled Lift festival, can come back. Our core mission is about gathering people and so we are going to try to do that digitally now, if we can’t do it physically any more."
"How clever of Hilary Mantel to write a 900-page novel to help us through the end times. How stupid of me to fall asleep in the bath while reading it. Maybe you’re in the same predicament. While we wait for our copies to dry in the proverbial airing cupboard, here are some other ideas to stop you becoming, during this testing period, what the Russians call ni kulturni (uncultured yahoos). New York’s Metropolitan Opera is streaming, free, an opera a night until they run out of material or humanity is reduced to feasting on its own brains, whichever happens first. From Monday until Sunday 29 March, it’s Wagner week – incluing, from Tuesday to Friday, the whole Der Ring Des Nibelungen tetralogy from the Met’s 2010 to 2012 productions, starring Wendy Bryn Harmer, Deborah Voigt, Eva-Maria Westbroek, Stephanie Blythe, Jonas Kaufmann, Bryn Terfel and Hans-Peter König. If, like me, you yearn to know how self-isolating star Neil Young is holding up at this difficult time, you won’t have to wait too long. On his elegant website, the NYA Times-Contrarian, Young promises that soon he will be streaming from his fireside. It will be “a down-home production, a few songs, a little time together”. He will be flanked by sleeping dogs and filmed by his wife, Daryl Hannah, as he tears into Cortez the Killer. Art Basel just opened its Online Viewing Rooms offering publicly accessible, timed, online exhibitions from 233 participating galleries. Works you can experience, albeit virtually, include a Yayoi Kusama infinity mirrored room, Life Shines On (2019), and Philippe Parreno’s My Room Is Another Fish Bowl (2016), an installation of 150 fish-shaped Mylar balloons that float gently through a glass-enclosed pavilion in response to human interaction and atmospheric changes. While we’re self-isolating, Hampstead theatre is very astutely streaming on Instagram its 2018 production of I and You, whose protagonist, Caroline, is housebound through illness and reliant on social media and the internet. Played by Game of Thrones’ sword-wielding star Maisie Williams, Caroline’s story speaks to me and perhaps you: she’s mad at the world and loves only her cat, ice-cream and glitter. Her solitude is rudely interrupted by classmate Anthony (Zach Wyatt) who invites himself in and, as Michael Billington put it in his review, “breaks through her defences with the aid of Whitman’s Leaves of Grass”. Which never worked for me. Sophie Duker is not only host of the Wacky Racists comedy club but also a black pansexual living in post-Brexit Britain, a comic whose managers reckon she tells jokes “with the confidence of a cis straight middle-class white man”. Sadly, her live shows this spring have been nixed. So, instead, we must bask in her wonderfulness online. Try some of her best bits, such as The Funny Thing About Privilege or I Accidentally Put Chilli in My Vagina. After their sell-out run of Showstoper! at the Lyric theatre in London’s West End was cancelled last week, the Olivier Award-winning improv group the Showstoppers decided to stream a show on Facebook Live. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram users suggested possible settings and plot twists. The result was – for one night only – a 45-minute Scottish musical called Haggis! (their exclamation mark) performed in an empty theatre. Watch it online now. It’s very silly and will cheer you up. In one of art’s earliest depictions of social distancing, Titian’s Noli Me Tangere (1514), the resurrected Jesus swerves the outstretched hands of Mary Magdalen even though, quite possibly, she has just washed them for 20 seconds. Paralleling Jesus, who did not want his followers to cling to his physical presence, the closed National Gallery in London has ascended into cyberspace by means of a Google virtual tour. Many of its masterpieces – including works by Titian, Veronese and Holbein – can now be enjoyed in perfect self-isolation. Yungblud, the 22-year-old Doncaster rock star (real name Dominic Richard Harrison), has been forced to cancel live gigs because of the coronavirus pandemic, but that won’t stop him getting his music to his fans. “Get on your bed, your kitchen table, your couch – and jump!,” he shouts from an eerily empty theatre during his new online gig before his band kick into another raucous ditty. Welcome to The Yungblud Show, a live-streamed gig that also features likable oddball rock’n’roll approximations of Saturday Morning Kitchen such as Yungblud swigging vodka from the bottle before testing a Flamin’ Hot Cheetos pancake. “Let me see your hands in the air! In your bedroom!,” he exhorts his virtual followers. How does he see those hands? I’ve no idea. It’s rock’n’roll, just not as we knew it. Eastbourne’s loss is the world’s gain. The Original Theatre Company’s production of Alan Bennett’s The Habit of Art, starring Matthew Kelly as WH Auden and David Yelland as Benjamin Britten, was due to start a tour at the Devonshire Park theatre last week. After the theatre was closed, the cast filmed a performance that will soon be available online. The production was given fives stars by the Observer in 2017, with critic Clare Brennan arguing: “The result is a take on life, sexuality, death and everything, that is witty, moving, laugh-aloud funny and understatedly profound.” Which is more than you can say for The Grand Tour. The superb Celeste’s British tour has been cancelled because of the pandemic. But there are compensations. She has created a live-streamed gig from what looks like her bedroom. Celeste (full name Celeste Epiphany Waite) is the BBC’s Sound of 2020 winner and the soul singer behind such quietly devastating songs as Strange, Father’s Son and Coco Blood. The impromptu gig on Instagram is part of the World Health Organisation’s Together, At Home virtual concert series that also features John Legend, One Direction’s Niall Horan and Coldplay’s Chris Martin. Is laughter the best medicine right now? No, medicine is the best medicine. But comedy can help. Comedian Mark Thomas is offering online access to a live virtual gig to fundraise for food banks. To see his show, called Check Up: Our NHS at 70, you make a donation to the the Trussell Trust – a charity that runs a network of 12 food banks. Once you’ve done so, you will be able to download the final performance of the show, which Thomas performed in Wakefield, along with interviews he did with NHS workers. The premise was that the approximate UK national average life expectancy is 84. So, if Thomas makes it to 84, the NHS will be 100 – but which will be in the better shape? The question prompted Thomas to go on a journey through the NHS, witnessing stomach surgery and visiting renal units and dementia care before reflecting on his own and socialised medicine’s mortality. But, you know, with laughs. As long as you’re prepared to pay £15.99 to Amazon for the privilege for each film, you can now watch a few recent cinema releases at home. Jeff Bezos’s drones call this service their “early access” facility. Movies available include the latest big-screen adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma, and Hilary Swank in The Hunt, which the Observer’s critic Simran Hans found to be a silly satire sending up “smug, bourgeois liberals complaining about climate change, all the while humanising their gun-toting conservative counterparts”. Most promising of these releases is The Invisible Man in which Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) is pursued by her invisible, abusive ex. As Hans pus it in her four-star review, this take on HG Wells’s story has a Hitchockian twist and reveals “the way women’s concerns are so often rendered invisible”. The BBC is launching a service called Culture in Quarantine, by means of which shows including Emma Rice’s Wise Children, which was first shown at the Old Vic, and Mike Bartlett’s Albion – filmed at the Almeida – will be broadcast. The idea is that, while theatres are closed, “new theatre and dance performances will join with modern classics to create a repertory theatre of broadcast”, according to BBC arts director Jonty Claypole. The launch date for this service is yet to be disclosed. One of the great pleasures of virtual art tours is that not only do you save on air fare, entrance fees and queuing time, but you can explore empty galleries in your own time without getting elbowed or having your backpack checked by security. One of the best such tours is the Vatican Museums’. Swivel upwards in the Sistine Chapel to see Michelangelo’s Adam and Eve being shown out of the Garden of Eden in shame. Then head over to the Raphael Rooms. Not another soul in sight. Bliss. The Coronavirus Theatre Club goes live on 29 March. It comprises Samantha Neale, Brian Lonsdale and Michael Blair, a group of actors from north-east England who are trying to create work during the epidemic by linking up actors with writers to live-stream monologues and short scenes. Fingers crossed, the results will be terrific. Roll up the rug, kick off your shoes, push the furniture against the wall and try not to pirouette into the dog or smack your dance partner in the face with a flailing arm. The fabulous Tamara Rojo, artistic director of the English National Ballet, as well as a lead principal dancer. is offering streamed ballet classes on Facebook. The safe money says she’ll not only be getting quarantined Brits en pointe and fitter than ever, but also making her Dennis the Menace-style red-and-black-striped legwarmers must-haves this season. Jonathan Biss plays Beethoven’s last three piano sonatas from the empty concert hall of the 92nd Street Y in New York on 26 March. I’m looking forward to Op 111 as a whole, but especially the boogie woogie moments that pre-dated Jools Holland by the best part of two centuries. Heather Phillipson has spent the past couple of years working on her sculpture for the fourth plinth in London’s Trafalgar Square, only to have this month’s unveiling postponed. Bask in her multimedia work in another way, starting with Almost Gone on BBC Sounds, billed as a “a deranged sonic landscape, addressing the Earth as an eruption, on the verge of termination”. It’s the perfect soundtrack to our times. Then try her poetry, say, Relational Epistemology and virtually tour her recent Age of Love installation at the Baltic in Gateshead. By the time you’ve got through that lot, it’ll probably be time to come out of our bunkers, wander down to Trafalgar Square and see what she has in store for us on the fourth plinth. Appropriately, it’s called The End."
"“Every now and then, in the middle of Tuesday afternoon, when you’ve seen a run of really bad films – Mighty Pups, say, followed by some terrible Michael Bay movie – and you’re scuttling from one screening room to another, and it’s raining, and you’ve got a deadline, and you’ve been up since 5am, and you think: ‘Ohhh, life is so hard!’ But then you go: ‘Hang on a minute…’” Mark Kermode takes a breath and reflects on his professional fortunes. “When I went to the school careers office, they told me I should probably work in an insurance office. Instead,” – he draws the next six words out for emphasis – “I watch films for a living. Which is astonishing to me. I should never ever complain about the job that I have, because I have the best job in the world.” Kermode got the job as the Observer’s chief film critic in 2013, taking over from the late, great Philip French, who was retiring after 50 years in the role. Prior to that, he had written for Time Out, NME and Fangoria, as well as broadcasting about film for the BBC and Channel 4. Each new gig delighted him, but when the Observer first got in touch in 2003, asking him to fill in while French was away, Kermode recalls being “completely overwhelmed” by the opportunity. (Aptly, given his love of horror films, his first review was of the Japanese chiller Dark Water.) Every Monday and Tuesday, in normal times, Kermode travels to London from the New Forest, where he lives with his wife, the film studies professor Linda Ruth Williams, and watches eight or nine films in Soho’s screening rooms. He takes notes as he watches – “I don’t use a light-up pen or any of that nonsense, I just taught myself to write in the dark” – jotting down things that particularly strike him, “like the composition of a shot, or a particular line, or the use of a piece of music, or a striking juxtaposition of scenes”. Agreeing on his film of the week with his editor at the Observer, he gets his notes in order on the train home and writes his column on Wednesday morning. Kermode admits to finding writing “the most stressful thing on Earth”. After filing at 1pm, “I worry away at it for the rest of the afternoon while subbing queries come in. And then it goes off on Thursday and I am filled with the belief that what I’ve written is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written ever and it will bring the newspaper to its knees. Then it comes out on Sunday and it starts all over again.” In spite of this, Kermode’s love of film criticism runs deep. As a kid, growing up in Hertfordshire, he used to keep notes of all the films he watched. Now, in his home office crammed with movie memorabilia, books and DVDs, he is adamant the form remains as vital and relevant as ever in the social media age. He welcomes one significant change. “There have always been brilliant female film critics, but I think people finally started to realise that the fact that a room full of the same ageing white blokes wasn’t doing anybody any good.” His Observer deputies Wendy Ide and Simran Hans are, he says, brilliant. “Working with them makes me constantly up my game.” The career moment I’ll never forget“The Sunday that the first review I wrote for the Observer came out, I remember sitting with the paper open on the kitchen table, just looking at it going: “I’ve arrived.” I thought to myself, look, I’m in the Observer, I must know what I’m talking about!” “It seems to me it comes in three stages,” says Laura Cumming of the process of reviewing art for the Observer New Review. “First, there’s the exhilaration of seeing the show. Then there’s the torture of thinking it through; and finally the torture is relieved by the writing.” Cumming has been working through these stages on an almost weekly basis for more than 20 years. Born in Edinburgh to artist parents, she studied English literature at university and started out as a producer and presenter for the BBC. Her deeply held interest in art was channelled first through radio shows on painting and then through writing for the New Statesman and the Guardian before she became the Observer’s art critic in 1999. Over the years, Cumming has taken great pleasure in witnessing artists embrace “film and video and performance and installation and ballet, and every other field that has come into art to enrich it” – and she still feels exhilarated every time she goes to a gallery. “The prospect of each new show,” she says, “is like virgin snow.” She prepares by poring over the catalogue and soaking up everything else she can find about the artist, from books to online video clips. Then she goes to a critics’ preview, usually on the weekend before her review comes out. Making notes and sketches with pen and paper, she also uses her phone to “photograph astonishing details that I know I will never see again – I’ve got billions of them stored away”. Occasionally, she’ll catch herself saying out loud things like “shocking, shocking” or “for God’s sake!”, but there’s rarely anyone around to hear it, because, as she acknowledges: “We see exhibitions when the galleries are completely empty, which is of course both an enormous privilege and an unreality.” Back home, in south London, she commits her notes to laptop and lets it sit, usually overnight, while she wrestles with “the thinking bit, which is the torture”. Then comes the release. “I write in our bedroom in the loft – I don’t have a study,” she says. “And I write a lot in bed, because I don’t really have a desk either.” The words come slowly. Reviewing a Jackson Pollock retrospective early in her career, she spent eight hours writing and rewriting the first paragraph. “So thank God for deadlines,” she says. “I love deadlines. I love the clarity they impose on your thought.” What’s striking about her home in Clapham, which I visited before the coronavirus outbreak, is how little art there is on the walls. She has some reproductions of prints, notably “a blow-up of Las Meninas [by Velázquez] on a big card, which I love looking at”, but otherwise it’s mainly work by her parents – her father James’s geometrical paintings (an example is in the photograph above), her mother Betty’s tapestries. “I don’t collect art,” she says. “I’m not acquisitive. I’m much happier seeing it in its natural state in the wild, in the gallery, rather than in my house.” There are things that dismay her about her field. “One big change in the past couple of decades,” she says, “has been the crowning of curators – sometimes you are following a curator’s mind rather than an artist’s.” She is suspicious of the commercial workings of the art world and tries to steer clear of curators, artists and publicists when seeing shows. “Our job,” as she puts it, “is to be critics, not courtiers.” For all that, reviewing for the Observer is a high point of Cumming’s week, which is also taken up by authoring books (On Chapel Sands, her 2019 memoir-through-photography about her mother has been shortlisted for many awards). Despite the torturous moments that precede the writing, “it is not agonising,” she insists. “It is an absolute privilege and a total joy.” The career moment I’ll never forget“In 2006, before the Velázquez exhibition at the National Gallery, I came upon one of the paintings laid out on a table while conservators were trying to work out whether or not a fleck of paint had come off the surface. It was a scene like The Anatomy Lesson of Doctor Nicolaes Tulp, with low lights over the painting and people in white gloves carefully examining whether or not they’d lost a dot of light on the hem of an infanta’s gown. They hadn’t, as it turned out, but to be in the room and be able to see what they were looking at in such close-up was extraordinary.” Bidisha has written about books, art, film and music since she was a teenager, but when she became a regular dance critic last year, a role she shares with the critic Sarah Crompton, she almost couldn’t figure out how to handle it. “Every single person I spoke to said: ‘Don’t you realise it’s absolutely the dream job?’” she laughs. “And I realised that my feeling was actually just sheer disbelief that I get paid to do something that doesn’t feel like work at all.” The role fits seamlessly with her wider career as a journalist, writer and film-maker – and her natural night-owl tendencies. “I get home at 11, so if you finish by two that’s just a normal bedtime,” she says. “The most fun thing is coming home, making the decaf coffee, and then sitting at the computer. The street’s really quiet; your thoughts are really clear.” Her pre-virus morning routine may prompt howls of jealousy in those working nine to five: she usually sleeps till 10.30. “That’s the norm – but I get most done in the evenings, I’m most awake then.” Bidisha also finds it rather helpful to have to go out a few nights a week. “I love to work from home because you just get so much more done. But we’re living in a time of increasing atomisation, where we watch films on our laptops, we watch TV on our laptops, we read at home, so being pulled out is incredibly valuable.” Plus writing about dance has a fruitful impact on her own creative practice of making short films: “You learn so much about how to present something dramatic from dance. It’s teaching me a lot about lighting and music and costume, about editing and storytelling.” If she’s reviewing in the evening, Bidisha will spend the day catching up with life admin before heading to the theatre for 7pm. “I love to people-watch beforehand – dance audiences are the most fabulously dressed,” she says. She’ll take “very complete” notes during the performance, so that almost the whole review is in her notebook by the end. Writing it up involves topping and tailing with context and interpretation. “But I’m very, very against obscurantism,” she says vehemently. “A lot of critics fall into the trap of saying ‘Well, this Beethoven was nothing like when I saw it in New York in 1974’. It’s a form of willy-measuring, and I can’t stand it.” Bidisha’s approach is simply to describe the movement. “People think you need a special kind of vocabulary for dance, which you don’t at all. You don’t have to find a story; just sit back and enjoy it. And that’s what I try to do.” But for all the joy, criticism is still a job. “I’ve stopped going with friends because they’re a bad influence! We always wound up having two martinis and dinner at 11. Now I eat enough at five so I’m full during the performance, then have hot skimmed milk when I get home if I’m peckish.” She also tries to leave as quickly as possible. “It’s not a night out, so I just want to pack up the stuff, and beat the rush for the exit.” That means that she – and the other critics, usually sat on the ends of the row – scoot out without applauding. “And it’s because we’re cynical, jaded hacks,” she admits. “How many times can you possibly clap for a thing?” Interview by Holly Williams Before Rowan Moore became a full-time architecture critic, he worked on the other side of the fence, training as an architect and co-running his own practice until 1994. Though he went on to edit Blueprint magazine and review for the Daily Telegraph and Evening Standard – as well as heading up the Architecture Foundation from 2002 to 2008 – his early experience helped him appreciate the difficulties of the profession from the inside. “Although I criticise architects,” he says, “I think to put up a building that has some kind of intention to it, that realises an idea, is a hugely impressive achievement.” Moore, who joined the Observer in 2010, considers it his job to weigh up “broader issues around architecture as well as architecture itself”. Instead of simply writing about “a single work by a master of the art form”, he’ll think carefully about the people who move through the building, the area in which it stands, and the social, political and economic factors that shaped it. One unusual aspect of his job is that – unlike other forms of criticism that, in normal times, depend on a weekly schedule of releases – it’s not always clear what he’ll write about. Sometimes, in the absence of a new building or exhibition to assess, “it’s a case of making your own story”, he says. Lately, this has meant taking aim at Tory planning policies or surveying architectural responses to the climate crisis. Another difference is that Moore’s job often involves speaking to the people whose work he’s critiquing. “I don’t believe in writing about buildings as magical objects that just appear one day, because they’re always there for a reason, or many reasons,” he says. “So I talk to people – clients as well as architects – and ask them what they’re trying to do.” He jots all this down in a notebook and snaps details with his phone, before heading home to write – ideally over a couple of days so he can take a fresh look at his copy before filing. Having previously worked on daily newspapers with fast turnarounds, Moore finds it “a fantastic luxury on the Observer to be able to take more time over articles”. He’s susceptible to the odd bit of procrastination – “I distract myself by looking at football results and the news” – but when it comes to writing Moore doesn’t seem at all precious. “I can write with noise in the background,” he says, and at home in Whitechapel, east London, “I just wander around with my laptop and write wherever I fancy.” There is plenty of space to wander around in: his home consists of two smallish 1830s terraced houses joined together, with dividing walls removed on the ground floor so that the kitchen opens into a spacious living room with a huge desert-scape by his painter friend Jock McFadyen on the wall. At the back is a long, gently sloping extension which was added to accommodate Moore’s late wife, who was diagnosed with MS in her mid-30s. By 2011, she was using a wheelchair and no longer able to access the bedroom and bathroom upstairs. “The extension was about giving her everything she needed without any steps,” says Moore. It was also about “enhancing the house rather than the opposite”. When architects design for disability, “there’s still a bit of an attitude that if you’re fixing somebody’s practical problem, they should be grateful for it,” says Moore, “even if it’s really ugly and messes up the house.” With this extension, which slopes gracefully down to a bedroom and bathroom, opening on to a garden with decked pathways amid sumac and eucalyptus trees, Moore and his wife, who died in 2017, were challenging that view. In its joyful layering of different periods, the house repudiates one of Moore’s pet hates in architecture. “When I started out in the 80s, the dominant narrative was: modern architects have messed everything up,” he recalls. “Now lots of people get the idea that modern design can do something for you. But it’s the opposition of modern and old that I find very unhelpful.” Though he expresses strong views in his columns, and mostly regrets “the ones when I was too nice – when I tried too hard to be positive in a situation where it wasn’t warranted”, Moore doesn’t regard himself as a “final arbiter” on any given project. “I have a viewpoint that I think has a validity, because I know about this subject and I’ve spent a lot of time looking at buildings,” he says. “But whatever I write, it’s not the be-all and end-all – it’s a contribution to an ongoing process of understanding architecture.” The career moment I’ll never forgetIn 1986, after finishing university, he went to Los Angeles to write some magazine articles, which put him in contact with Frank Gehry and other interesting architects. “The climate in Britain at that time was extremely suspicious of new architecture, so it was really exciting and encouraging to go to California, where there was a very positive view and really interesting things going on. It gave me a lot of faith that new buildings could be good.” “Sideways,” is how Susannah Clapp describes her route into writing about theatre. In 1994, after years of working in and around the publishing industry – she helped found the London Review of Books and wrote a biography of the writer Bruce Chatwin – she was asked to review plays for the BBC Radio 3 arts programme Night Waves, a gig that involved dashing straight from the theatre to deliver a “match report” on the latest stage action. Moving into print, Clapp reviewed for the New Statesman before becoming chief theatre critic for the Observer in 1997. Having spent so much time focusing on the written word, “it was exciting to work in something which also required you to think about how things looked,” she recalls. “Theatre involves so many different reactions – acoustic, visual, working out how people’s gestures influence or interrupt what they say – all of which is instantaneous and can’t be captured instantaneously in a book.” One of her aims, starting out, was to avoid writing literary reviews “which suggested that plays were composed of cut-out text walking around the stage”. Instead, she wanted “to write about [characters] as if you’re writing about an enhanced group of friends, or enemies, a hyperactive piece of life, and I suppose that’s joy of it – that, at its best, theatre either takes you out of your life or further into it.” The fact that “there are so many different things going on at the same time” on the stage is endlessly compelling. “Even if you’re squirming with boredom or frustration, you can isolate an element of design, or the one actor who elevates it – and if it’s simply a travesty, that in itself is interesting.” For her Observer column, Clapp usually reviews three plays per week. This involves a considerable amount of pre-planning – she keeps a “long, obsessive list” of forthcoming openings around the country. Even when the week ahead has been finalised, she can never be quite sure, until she’s seen them all, which of the three plays will be her lead review. As a result, “the major part of the writing always gets done at the last minute”. She makes notes in the theatre, “but they’re often unreadable because I don’t have very good handwriting”, she says. “Quite often, I forget to turn over the page and I find that I’ve written my already indecipherable scrawl on top of something else – but I hope that the act of writing fixes it in my mind.” She tries to identify her “line” on the play in the same night – “just simply, whether I liked it or not. And what is the first thing I would say about this if I were describing it to a friend?” There are a number of small but niggling dilemmas that accompany a theatre critic through her week. The hours are odd – you’re starting work when others are clocking off – and the timing of dinner is often fraught. “Do you eat beforehand and risk getting sleepy? On the other hand, if you go hungry, and there’s a play with a lot of eating in it, it’s a nightmare.” It’s odd, too, rubbing shoulders with fellow critics night after night – “we share a vocabulary, we share a task, though we’re not exactly colleagues” – while having to resist discussing the play at hand, lest it sway your opinion. “It’s certainly the most male profession I’ve ever worked in – much more male and, of course, white than broadcasting or publishing or literary journalism. It’s changing now, but very slowly.” Home is a flat overlooking a square near King’s Cross, London. Here Clapp does most of her writing in her front room, which is lined with play texts, theatrical biographies and reference books, though she sometimes works in a cafe or library. “I am a big believer in walking as writing (or vice versa),” she says. “If I get stuck, I charge around the square and often find a sentence slips into place. I work out what I think more easily on the hoof – going to or from the theatre, or emptying the rubbish – than when stooped over my desk.” The career moment I’ll never forget“Punchdrunk’s site-specific production of Faust in a warehouse in Wapping – a meticulously created Edward Hopper world with bubbling test tubes and stinky herbs and extraordinarily fragrant pine forests. When I came out, I felt that my eyes and my body had been dismantled and put back together, and I looked at what I saw in a different way.”"
"A Brit school alumna, singer and producer, Georgia Rose Harriet Barnes was born in 1990 in London. Her debut album, Georgia, came out in 2015 and her latest, Seeking Thrills, released in January, went to No 1 in the UK indie charts. She is the daughter of Neil Barnes, co-founder of electronic music group Leftfield, and was previously a drummer for artists Kwes and Kate Tempest. She was longlisted for BBC Sound of 2020 and is currently on tour. Avenue 5 I absolutely love Armando Iannucci – he’s one of my favourite comedy writers. I’ve been a fan since The Thick of It. He is so on point when it comes to the politics of today. I love his new comedy Avenue 5. It’s set in the future, when travelling into space becomes the new form of travel. Something terrible goes wrong and it’s going to take years to get back to Earth. It’s about the collapse of society on a spacecraft. I’m fascinated by Iannucci’s mind. He’s able to portray the madness of society so brilliantly. Gary Numan: The Pleasure Principle – The First Recordings I’m a big Gary Numan fan. I was flicking through the new wave section in Rough Trade in Nottingham and came across this new reissue of the Pleasure Principle demos. I’m fascinated by the process of making records. I’m often more interested in that than in the outcome. These are an interesting ride. You get to hear how his song Cars started out. Perhaps I should release some demos, too. I think it’s interesting for the audience to hear the whole process. Crimetown Presents: The Ballad of Billy Balls The second instalment of the true-crime series that investigates different mysteries tells the tale of a man who bursts into an East Village apartment in 1982 and shoots punk musician Billy Balls. It’s a totally mesmerising story that kept me and my touring party entertained through Europe. It has a great narrator who is on a personal journey, so you feel like you are on the journey with him. It’s about murder, lies and coming of age – it’s really one of the best podcasts I’ve ever listened to. Also, I love New York and particularly the whole CBGB scene. Beyond Heaven: Chicago House Party Flyers 1983-1989 I’m an obsessive about the Chicago house scene, and this was a birthday present from a good friend who was in the city. It’s a book of flyers from those parties. They’re so colourful. It’s something we don’t really do any more, but through these flyers, you can tell a lot about the era. I’m on tour a lot and it’s hard to find time to read, but something that is this visual, I can really enjoy. It makes me feel centred and grounded when I read it as I pay respect to the sounds that I’ve used on my own records. Cai Kitchen, Hamburg While travelling in Germany, I tracked down this vegan Szechuan Chinese cafe after discovering it on Holy Cow, a vegan and vegetarian food app. I ordered the fried sweet potatoes in a black bean sauce, a rice bowl with fermented mushroom, ginger, greens, tofu and sesame. You mix it all together and it’s pure heaven. It’s probably my favourite restaurant in the world. It’s so cheap. I was a bit worried about putting it on my Instagram because I didn’t want it to blow up, but I felt like this place really deserved to be known. Everybody in the Place: An Incomplete History of Britain 1984-1992, by Jeremy Deller Rave culture is very personal to me because my father was in Leftfield. I don’t think I’ve ever watched anything that has got it so right: how it changed people’s lives and the way music was affected by politics. The film felt so cohesive and truthful to the movement, and the way that it was presented as a lecture to a class of kids from different backgrounds was genius. It almost brought me to tears. I really like Jeremy Deller and his art and the way he celebrates working‑class culture."
"The Long Goodbye follows the standard tropes of a breakup album: voicemails from loved ones checking in, lyrics questioning what went wrong, karma coming for the toxic ex. Only the breakup here is between actor/rapper Riz Ahmed and his country: Britain becomes “Britney”, who laid with him and took his independence. It’s an evocative, albeit sometimes overwrought concept. Over humid beats from producer Redinho, Ahmed uses fast-paced rap and spoken word to interrogate colonialism. Toba Tek Singh jolts searingly; Fast Lava is all raw urgency; Deal With It pulses with confidence and wry bars (“they don’t like no ’fugees/ but they still killing us softly”). Plus, there’s a welcome feature from “R&Bollywood” prince Jay Sean on Any Day. Since his work as Riz MC, Ahmed has always admirably considered third culture identity in his music (that grappling with the idea of “home” for the children of immigrants), but perhaps in addressing a wider audience and sociopolitical issues that feel more pressing than ever, The Long Goodbye can feel heavy-handed: even those phoned-in messages from famous friends (Mindy Kaling, Asim Chaudhry) sound jarring. Ultimately, though, Ahmed delivers, offering up some clever writing on this powerful concept album."
"The British Museum has acquired a shimmering 3,000-year-old gold sun pendant heralded as one of the most important bronze age finds of the last century. The astonishingly well-preserved pendant, or bulla, was discovered by a metal detector enthusiast in Shropshire in 2018. Neil Wilkin, the museum’s bronze age curator, recalled dropping everything when he first saw it. “I was absolutely flabbergasted, I couldn’t believe my eyes,” he said. “To me it is the most important object from this period, the first age of metal, that has come up in about 100 years.” The pendant has been purchased for £250,000 using money from the Art Fund and the American Friends of the British Museum. Wilkin said it could easily pass as a glorious example of art deco jewellery from the 1930s. In reality it was made by someone who was clearly skilled in their craft around 1,000-800BC. “The skill and care with which it has been put together is remarkable,” he said. “It is just exquisite.” It comes from a period that is often misunderstood, associated with people living in huts or caves. Wilkin said that was understandable. “This is a subject, a period, that hasn’t been taught in school curriculums until very recently … I didn’t learn about it at school.” The pendant is decorated with semi-circles and geometric motifs, and on one side is a stylised solar design, reflecting the importance of the sun and its path across the sky to bronze age farmers. That depiction of the sun is seen in famous objects as the Trundholm sun chariot in Copenhagen and a small number of gold pendants found in Ireland, “but we haven’t really seen it on British objects until now,” said Wilkins. The pendant was found in a landscape that would have been boggy and wet during the bronze age. Curators think it would have been intentionally cast into the water as an offering, much as people today throw coins into fountains. It was found by a metal detectorist who wants to remain anonymous. All the correct procedures were adhered to in that it was reported to the local finds liaison officer who notified the coroner and brought it to the British Museum under the treasure process. A coroner found it to be treasure and the independent treasure valuation committee recommended to the culture secretary a valuation of £250,000. It will probably be known as the Shropshire sun pendant and will go on display from November at Shrewsbury museum and art gallery, near the find site. In 2021 it will come to the British Museum in London and will be displayed near other bronze age treasures such as the Mold gold cape. The pendant, 3.6cm by 4.7cm, is the second one ever found in Britain. The first was discovered during canal digging in Manchester in 1722 and was assumed by many experts to be Roman, because of its quality. It was last recorded in 1806 before disappearing from sight. Could it still be out there? “It is possible,” said Wilkin. “To find it would be astonishing but in some ways it wouldn’t surprise me. The weight of it means you wouldn’t necessarily think of melting it down for bullion. I do have a sneaking suspicion it is out there somewhere, just misunderstood or mislabelled.” "
"Trevor Noah broadcast live as results trickled in for Super Tuesday, a consequential night in which voters in 14 states “will decide whether the Democratic nominee should be an old man, or an even older man”. Vermont went handily to “the original founder of the state”, Bernie Sanders, as did Colorado. But the big story of the night was the surge of Joe Biden as black voters across the South pushed him to victory in Virginia, Alabama, and North Carolina. “Right now, black people are embracing Biden so hard I wouldn’t be surprised if he rolls up to his next debate speech like ‘Wakanda, For … you know the thing, you know the thing,’” said Noah. Super Tuesday – or, as the Daily Show called it, “Enough of this one-state-at-a-time bullshit” – was a great night for Biden, who over-performed polls with last-minute endorsements from three former Democratic rivals. On Monday night, he hosted a rally with former candidates Pete Buttigeg, Amy Klobuchar and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke. “Buttigieg came out to say Joe was the only one who could unite the party, Klobuchar came out to say that Joe is the best choice for moderates, and Beto O’Rourke came out to remind people he still exists,” Noah recapped. Mike Bloomberg, however, performed poorly, not winning a single state despite “spending money harder than a dad at Chuck E Cheese trying to keep custody of his kids”, Noah said. Bloomberg has spent $500m of his own money, on the campaign, far outpacing the other candidates. Joe Biden, for example, spent $4,000 on ads in California; Bloomberg spent $78m. (The state is projected to go to Sanders, and Bloomberg dropped out of the race Wednesday morning). But “all that money seems to have bought him is people digging up skeletons from his past and a debate where Elizabeth Warren completely burned him to the ground”, Noah said. So, for everyone asking whether a billionaire can buy an election, we might have an answer: “Bloomberg is not having the night he thought he paid for,” said a commentator on MSNBC. On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also recapped the Super Tuesday Senior Citizen Slam Down. “Yes, the moderates are consolidating,” said Colbert of Joe Biden’s surge and endorsements from former rivals. “We are reaching extreme levels of centrism.” The Late Show “politigraph” riff on the New York Times’ prediction needles showed a distinctive “meh”. At 77 years old, Biden is now the youngest man vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. “Keep in mind that the average life expectancy for men is about 76,” said Colbert. “So, if one of these Democratic men gets elected you know his first year is just going to be checking off the bucket list – ‘My fellow Americans, in my first 100 days I will learn to surf, I will buy a motorcycle and I will make out with Angie Dickinson’.” Biden was certainly boosted by the endorsements of two candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who dropped out last weekend. Former Texas congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke also endorsed Biden at a Super Tuesday eve rally. “Wow, Beto’s back too? This is like a reunion of Friends if some of the friends were gone longer than others and none of them were friends,” said Colbert. Trump, meanwhile, held a rally in North Carolina, where he pandered to the crowd by claiming his granddaughter was named Carolina “for a reason”. “Are his grandkids named after things he needs to win re-election?” said Colbert, impersonating Trump: “These are my granddaughters Carolina and Pennsylvania, those are my grandsons Voter Suppression, Rust Belt Coal Miner Who Votes Against His Economic Self-Interest, and of course, little Ku Klux Kenny.” By the time Jimmy Kimmel aired from Los Angeles, it was clear Mike Bloomberg’s cash dump in California was not paying off. Bloomberg, who spent $500m of his own money on his late-entry campaign, “basically spent the cost of an Avatar movie to find out nobody likes him”, Kimmel said. The elections demonstrated that perhaps a billionaire can’t buy the presidency, and that “adults love stickers, too”, said Kimmel. “I feel like some people are only voting so they can post a selfie with an ‘I Voted’ sticker on Instagram.” Meanwhile, Trump met with pharmaceutical executives at the White House on Tuesday to discuss coronavirus, and “of all the clips we’ve seen of our president at work, this one might be the scariest one of all”, said Kimmel: an executive explaining how no one in America has been vaccinated for coronavirus, because a vaccine does not exist (it’s likely over a year or more away), then Trump suggests using an ordinary flu vaccine. “As if they wouldn’t have thought of that... You’re a genius – you killed the coronavirus!” Kimmel deadpanned. “I have another idea: next time there’s a hurricane, we’ll just open all the toilet lids and flush it.”"
"Back in the music industry’s 1990s boom, when tenner-a-pop CD sales were skyrocketing, going on tour was a good way of shifting more product. After digital piracy burst that bubble in the early 2000s, however, touring became more of a financial necessity, creating a new, lopsided business model only accentuated in recent years by the rise of subscription streaming services. With gigs and festivals essentially banned under new measures to stave off the spread of coronavirus, how can we help artists who can no longer tour? Readers of a certain age will remember the thrill of holding an album in their hands but, guess what? They still make physical product! Vinyl sales are booming, you can still buy CDs and – in nostalgia news – cassettes are back, too. If there is nothing that immediately takes your fancy, maybe buy a voucher from an independent online retailer for later. Or, if your favourite act has recently put out a not-at-that-price lavish box set, such as Björk’s Utopia collection featuring 14 handmade bird call flutes, or Depeche Mode’s MODE, in which all 14 of their albums come housed in an elegant black cube, now might be the best time to treat yourself to a day’s worth of B-sides, remixes and forgotten radio sessions. The rise in touring has also meant a rise in merch, most of which is readily available directly from artist’s official websites, and has evolved to include not just T-shirts and caps, but tote bags (lo-fi pop experimentalists Girl Ray have a particularly fetching pink lipstick one), pillows (including a very sweary Cupcakke one), socks adorned with Aussie DJ and producer Flume’s name, FKA twigs shoelaces and – with time on our hands, why not – sex toys from the likes of Marilyn Manson and Sophie. Or, if your fave act is too cool for an official online shop, try Bandcamp, which only takes 10% for merch and music sales, and doesn’t charge artists to upload their music in the first place (the site has also started waiving its revenue share completely on certain days to boost direct sales for artists). The knock-on effect for future tours and festivals looks grim, but at least with the shows that have already been postponed financial losses can be sutured if people keep hold of their tickets where possible, rather than asking for a refund from promoters that likely don’t have the money any more. If classical music is more your thing, then you could spend a lockdown night at the opera (Opera North’s acclaimed Ring cycle is on its website), or how about soothing your fears with the London Symphony Orchestra, who are streaming full-length concerts every Sunday and Thursday evening. And, if more acts are going guerrilla and doing online “gigs” – as pop newcomers L Devine and Yungblud have done recently – then let’s all pop a dressing gown on and get involved. A sense of community is what we need right now. MC Outside the Royal Court theatre in London, the play banner reads: “Back soon”. At the Battersea Arts Centre, a new sign reads: “Hope”. Theatres have temporarily gone dark, but the response from the theatre industry has been swift, optimistic and tirelessly creative. A number of online theatrical enterprises have already emerged. The Show Must Go On will see the complete plays of Shakespeare read live on YouTube. A festival of musical concerts are to be streamed live from London’s Theatre Café, and Notflix – featuring some of the UK’s top female improvisers – will be performed on Facebook live throughout spring. Enterprising artists are moving their work online. Christopher Green’s No Show, about a performer who would rather stay at home than perform live, streams on the web-conferencing platform Zoom in March and April. The bods behind Showstopper! The Improvised Musical filmed one of their last productions before the shutdown. Kieran Hurley’s Bubble is streaming until 23 April: it was rehearsed and recorded on Skype, is set entirely on Facebook and is written in text-speak and emoji. Theatres are working hard to support their emerging artists. The King’s Head, Papatango, Southwark Playhouse and Luton’s Next Generation Youth Theatre are offering a selection of online advice sessions, workshops, play-reading clubs and choreography courses. The Bruntwood prize website includes interviews, mini-plays and live-recorded workshops by David Eldridge, Jo Clifford and Winsome Pinnock. (Bruntwood recently received an email from a woman in lockdown in Italy, delighted to be able to “learn things that would otherwise be unreachable”.) All the Web’s a Stage will feature a variety of live performances to raise money for artists struggling during the pandemic. The BBC has launched a virtual festival of arts, and Manchester’s HOME has launched a range of online theatrical experiences, including new work from Chris Thorpe and Bryony Kimmings. The National Theatre and Shakespeare’s Globe have particularly brilliant online catalogues. Bloomsbury’s Drama Online is a treasure trove for students, and LIVR – which provides recorded theatre in 360° VR – is available for a subscription fee. Amazon Prime also includes a healthy selection of live-recorded theatre, including Rent, Company, Billy Elliot and Cats. And yes, it’s the Elaine Paige Cats. And yes, it’s heaps better than the film. MG When gallery doors shut, art fairs are cancelled and public space empties, survival for many artists looks tough. Ordinarily, most make ends meet via a tangled web of teaching gigs, squeezed funding bodies, public projects and, sometimes, selling work. Can art lovers help out? Art dealers have sold to those with deep pockets on the strength of Jpegs for a long while. So, if you are a wealthy collector, keep buying. For everyone else, the good news is that there are ways you can support artists and experience new work from the safety of your living room. Artist’s prints, individually made books and other editions are often touted as a collector entry point. Art book publisher Phaidon’s platform Artspace has a bit of everything, with art historical greats for sale alongside newbies. Another way to help protect the system artists depend on is to buy works specially created to support not-for-profit public spaces. Cubitt, the cutting-edge gallery and artists’ studios in Islington, north London, sells everything from a tote bag to a £3,000 print box online. Among the editioned prints at Bristol’s Spike Island, Andy Holden’s Lecture on Nesting – with its cocoon-building birds – offers apt imagery for days indoors. Available through BALTIC in Gateshead, top painter George Shaw’s prints circle the housing estate where he grew up. But sales are just one part of art’s fragile ecology. Spreading ideas and keeping people engaged is essential. Commercial galleries, from international big gun Pace to smaller operations such as London’s Kate MacGarry are now organising shows and talks online. The charity Art UK, meanwhile, is inviting everyone to curate their own virtual exhibitions from the 216,000+ artworks it lists from the UK’s public collections. For original digital art commissions, there are a few institutions that have long led the way in terms of what is achievable in the virtual world. Among the Serpentine Galleries’ current web projects, you can navigate Suzanne Treister’s The Escapist BHST (Black Hole Space Time). With its promise of inter-dimensional travel to see painting archives in new universes via your computer screen, The Escapist … certainly feels like art for our housebound moment. SS Comedians are uniquely exposed by the outbreak. Their counterparts in theatre and music, visual art and dance have received words of support – with actions promised to follow – from the Arts Council of England and other organisations that exist to support them. Not so comics, whose work – individualistic, largely unregulated and mostly funded by ticket sales – is not recognised by the arts bodies. The flipside is that they may be more entrepreneurial than practitioners of other artforms. They are certainly well versed already in retooling their skills for digital media. The dictum about a technology only really existing once it is used to create porn could equally be said of comedy. In the time since the Covid-19 shutdown, there has been an uptick in the number of comics making material available online. If you want to help out struggling standups, look no further than NextUp, the so-called “Netflix for British standup” which has nearly 200 downloadable sets from the cream of fringe comedy – and shares revenue from downloads directly with performers. Comedian and activist Mark Thomas has launched another streaming initiative with the DVD label Go Faster Stripe. Each week, a comic will have one of their standup specials broadcast for free in exchange for a donation to the crisis-relief charity the Trussell Trust. One of the acts signed up is Richard Herring, who has also contributed to NextUp’s #hecklethevirus crowdfunder to help comedians stay afloat during the pandemic. At time of writing, it had raised £81K of an initial £100K target. Trading in moral support, if not yet money, the indie comedy producers Berk’s Nest and Fight in the Dog are offering advice sessions for the comedy industry using Zoom. Several of their acts, meanwhile, are likely to be appearing on Robin Ince’s hastily cobbled together Stay at Home festival, a daily (sometimes twice daily) livestream promising chat and entertainment from comics, scientists and artists, Chris Hadfield, Sara Pascoe, Mark Gatiss, Jo Brand and Prof Brian Cox among them. It is free to watch, but donations are requested for “performers and venues most in need in these difficult times”. BL"

"Organised crime is being blamed for a rise in illegal metal-detecting at heritage sites, including one of England’s finest medieval castles and the battlefield of Hastings. English Heritage said December last year was the worst month for such incidents in more than four years and there were more than double the number of incidents in 2019 as there were in 2017. In some cases there were up to 100 holes where the illegal metal detectorists – known as nighthawkers – had dug up the soil. “How many of those are productive we just don’t know,” said Win Scutt, a properties curator and archaeologist at English Heritage. The organisation is calling on members of the public to become its “eyes and ears” and report suspicious activity to the police. However, after some violent incidents it advised people not to confront nighthawkers. Scutt said it was not only about artefacts being dug up, taken and presumably sold. “It is the damage to the sites. They are destroying the archaeological record. You can compare it to a scene of crime and seeing a knife and a gun and thinking: ‘I’ll be helpful, I’ll take them along to the police,’ and they say: ‘You’ve just destroyed all the information.’ “This is why we protect our sites so carefully. Not even we dig them. We are trying to preserve the record for future generations.” Scutt said the activity was distressing. “These sites are in a sense libraries of archaeological information and poking holes in them is like burning down a library of documents that have never been read.” English Heritage said sites targeted included the Hastings battlefield in East Sussex, Goodrich Castle in Herefordshire and Old Sarum in Wiltshire, the site of Salisbury’s original cathedral. The majority of the more than 400 places maintained by English Heritage were unstaffed and free to enter. Scutt said he did not think ordinary metal detectorists would be naive enough to think it was acceptable or legal to use their detectors on scheduled monuments. “There seems to be a criminal element deliberately going on to our sites. We attribute the increase to organised crime … they are going for the goodies and they don’t care.” Mark Harrison, the head of crime strategy at Historic England, said it was not a victimless crime. “We may never see or fully understand the objects taken or damaged because they have been removed from their original sites with no care or record as to their history or context.” "
"Love (and sex) are very much in the air on television this spring as the much-hyped adaptation of Normal People, Sally Rooney’s bestselling novel, arrives on BBC Three. Relative newcomers Daisy Edgar-Jones (best-known as Olivia in Cold Feet) and Paul Mescal (making his TV debut) take the lead roles of Marianne and Connell, two very different teenagers who fall unexpectedly in love. It is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald and adapted by Rooney herself alongside Alice Birch and Mark O’Rowe. Amid the hype, the biggest question remains just how they’ve turned Rooney’s slender yet satisfying tale into a six-hour, 12-episode series. Elsewhere, Sky Atlantic has snaffled one of spring’s most glamorous casts as Nicole Kidman, Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland star in The Undoing, a psychological thriller about a marriage which collapses when the husband (Grant), a successful paediatric oncologist, vanishes, leaving his wife (Kidman) to discover that little in his life was as claimed. It will air in late May. Finally, sex of a less glamorous kind as playwright Lucy Kirkwood, author of Chimerica and The Welkin, returns to Channel 4 with Adult Material, a four-part look at the British porn industry. With original star Sheridan Smith having pulled out with a scheduling clash, the role of Jolene Dollar, a mother-of-three who is the UK’s biggest porn star, is taken by I, Daniel Blake’s Hayley Squires. Kirkwood has said she’s interested in exploring power structures and complicity in the workplace … so expect no easy answers. Sarah Hughes Two comic American writers, one new and one familiar from hit screenplays such as Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, are offering to help you through the spring with plangent tributes to the emotional clarity of a bygone era – represented in both cases by cinema. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has put a neurotic film critic at the centre of Antkind, his first novel, published by Random House on 12 May. The discovery of an unknown film masterpiece should change everything for this failing pundit until, of course, it is destroyed. At the end of the same month, Fourth Estate is to bring out debut novelist Simon Stephenson’s Set My Heart to Five, in which an android is moved by watching films from the 1980s and 90s. The run of highly rated literature on both sides of the Irish border continues with Roddy Doyle’s new novel Love, published by Jonathan Cape on 14 May. It starts with Joe and Davy reuniting in a Dublin restaurant to talk about their old but mislaid friendship. And one of them has a secret to share. Vanessa Thorpe You’ll have to hustle to get a ticket for 4000 Miles – expect queues for day seats and returns to be, well, almost as long as the title. For many, the draw of Timothée Chalamet making his British theatre debut will be enough to make it worth a shot. He stars in Amy Herzog’s inter-generational drama, alongside the redoubtable Eileen Atkins, at the Old Vic from 6 April. Under Milk Wood meets Twin Peaks in a new musical comedy: Milky Peaks is Seiriol Davies’ long-awaited follow-up to his hit 2016 show, How to Win Against History. That brought to life the story of a cross-dressing Marquess of Anglesey; Milky Peaks looks likely to have more eccentrics in its sights, being a “queer Welsh fable” about tensions within a Snowdonian settlement nominated as Britain’s Best Town. It’ll be at Theatr Clwyd in Mold, from 20 March, before touring Wales till 9 May. Actress Kate Fleetwood – who’s given very good villain in Medea and Macbeth – is surely perfect, terrifying casting as Cruella de Vil in a new musical version of Dodie Smith’s 101 Dalmatians. Zinnie Harris’s production arrives at the Regent’s Park Open Air theatre in London from 16 May; expect heart-stirring puppetry, too, from Toby Olié, who’s worked on War Horse and Running Wild. Holly Williams The most anticipated show of the year, if not the decade, is devoted to Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1654), Italian painter, precocious Caravaggio successor, fearless traveller and all-round heroine of art. Gentileschi painted women as strong as herself: Cleopatra, Lucretia, Judith cutting off the head of the despotic Holofernes. She is also the first woman to show herself, sleeves rolled, sweat on her brow, in the very physical act of painting a self-portrait. The National Gallery’s show, opening on 4 April, will be a surprise from first to last, not least because many of the masterpieces have never been shown before in this country. From 2 April, meanwhile, the Manchester Art Gallery will be hosting Derek Jarman Protest!. Director, writer, set-designer, political activist and gardener of the shingle at Dungeness, where he lived his last years at Prospect Cottage, Jarman was one of the most influential polymaths of the late 20th century. From the great films – Sebastiane, Caravaggio, Jubilee – to the anguished self-portraits and righteous protest paintings, the designs for opera, ballet and the movies of Ken Russell, all the way to the enthralling diaries and sketchbooks, this show will present every aspect of his mind: Jarman in the round. Just as summer begins, the British Museum will plunge deep into the mysterious icescapes of the Arctic, where 4 million people still live in a culture shaped by the climate. From 28,000-year-old jewellery, discovered in newly thawing ice, to sculpted figures of men and dogs, walrus ivory needles, fur clothes and contemporary photography, this is a portrait of a society through the lens of time and weather. Expect the show, from 28 May, to be as revelatory as the museum’s magnificent blockbuster Ice Age. Laura Cumming Spring’s seasonal pop uptick hits warp speed in April. Fresh as a daisy is Brighton singer Celeste, who – like Adele before her – recently picked up a Brits Rising Star award to add to her BBC Sound of 2020 accolade. This velveteen-voiced soul singer heads out on tour supporting Michael Kiwanuka in March, but she has her own short UK headline tour in April, taking in Glasgow (27 April, Manchester (28 May) and the Shepherd’s Bush Empire, London (29 May). Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds’ latest album, Ghosteen, is both a hugely affecting, once-in-a-lifetime record, and an album you fervently wish had never been recorded. A song cycle based on the death of one of Cave’s teenage sons, this keening document of grief is playing arenas all over Europe. The UK leg starts at Birmingham Arena on 2 May and ends with two nights at the O2 in London on 14 and 15 May. Kitty Empire Released in 1997, Final Fantasy VII, the first video game epic, has become the Star Wars: A New Hope for a generation of players now in their 30s. The visuals have dated terribly but the story, about a group of eco-terrorists fighting a corporation that’s turbo-sapping the earth of natural resources, has never been timelier. Prime time for this remake then, cherishingly rebuilt from the ground up using cutting-edge technology. That the project has been broken into multi-parts (of which this – Final Fantasy VII: Remake- will be first when it is released on 10 April) bespeaks the scale of the work. The chance to resurrect and reconnect with some of the medium’s most beloved characters is exhilarating. Simon Parkin This season brings a double-whammy of edgy, exciting debuts from new British female film-makers. Rose Glass’s sensational Saint Maud, which earned her a special jury mention at last year’s London Film Festival, is a uniquely unnerving religious horror film, anchored by ferocious performances from Morfydd Clark and Jennifer Ehle, in which a pious home nurse hired to care for a hedonistic, cancer-stricken dancer reveals an ominous higher calling. Imagine Lynne Ramsay directing Carrie and you’re some of the way there, though it’s best experienced cold. Don’t read too much about it before it opens on 1 May. Meanwhile, Emerald Fennell’s Promising Young Woman, which opens on 17 April, made a buzzy, bloody splash at January’s Sundance festival: an audacious blend of revenge thriller and pitch-black comedy for the #MeToo era, it gives Carey Mulligan the meatiest and most surprising lead role of her career as Cassie, a seemingly hapless barfly who turns out to be waging a crafty vendetta against sexual predators. Expect laughs, gasps and much ensuing debate – a combination you’d expect from Fennell, the writer-director who succeeded Phoebe Waller-Bridge as scriptwriter on Season 2 of TV’s Killing Eve. Waller-Bridge has her own big-screen writing debut out next month: a little film you may have heard of called No Time to Die. It’s hoped that the Fleabag creator’s addition to the team behind the latest James Bond spectacular will bring a sharper, more modern edge to the usual macho 007 derring-do. We’ll find out on 2 April... Guy Lodge Beyond Beethoven 9 is Beethoven as you’ve never heard before. A massed choir of 350 singers – including Only Boys Aloud, the Bach Choir, the London Philharmonic Choir, Kaos Signing Choir, Voicelab, Lister Community School Choir and Finchley Children’s Music Group – together with the 164-strong National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, performance group Kinetica Bloc and jazzers Tomorrow’s Warriors, celebrate Beethoven’s 250th Anniversary at the Royal Festival Hall with a new version of his Ninth Symphony. Three new compositions will be interspersed before and between Beethoven’s original four-movement work for two performances on 16 and 18 April. Poet Anthony Anaxagorou has made a new English text of the Ode to Joy, and Marin Alsop conducts. Fiona Maddocks This May a legend of dance will collaborate with a pioneering company to present a unique spin on a classic work of contemporary dance: the Pina Bausch Foundation is working with École des Sable, the international centre for traditional and contemporary African dance in Senegal, to stage Bausch’s ferocious 1975 take on Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring. Pulling in global influences and using an all-black cast of dancers to express the story of ritual femicide, the evening will feature performers Germaine Acogny, founder of École des Sables, and Malou Airaudo, who was an early member of Pina Bausch. It promises to be unmissable and unforgettable. Launching in Dakar at Théâtre National Daniel Sorano on 25 March, The Rite of Spring/common ground[s] will receive its UK premiere at Sadler’s Wells from 17-20 May. Bidisha This article was updated on 4 March 2020 to correct the name of one of the companies producing Rite of Spring at Sadler’s Wells in May."
"The closure of so many libraries in the UK over the last decade has been “violent and vile” and is “absolutely heartbreaking”, the artist Edmund de Waal said as he opened his own temporary library at the British Museum. De Waal has created an installation titled library of exile, which contains 2,000 books by exiled writers from Ovid and Tacitus to TS Eliot and Judith Kerr. It was partly inspired by the “toxic environment” refugees have faced over the last 10 years, after De Waal looked at his bookshelf and realised he was surrounded by books written by people in exile. The work is also a celebration of libraries and a meditation on how many have been lost, including in the UK. The library was a highlight of last year’s Venice Biennale, installed in the city’s Jewish Ghetto. It then went to Dresden and from Thursday it will be open to visitors in the UK for the first time. “If you think about the violence that has been wreaked on our social fabric over the last 10 years, the closure of libraries has been violent and vile,” De Waal said. “There are very few spaces where kids can go to be silent and quiet and read books and discover things. The idea that there are 20% fewer libraries open now than there were 10 years ago is absolutely disgraceful. “We should not be a society that closes libraries. It is absolutely heartbreaking.” De Waal said the closure of any library was an act of fear, “a way of closing down possibilities”. Visitors to De Waal’s library are encouraged to do things normally frowned on in libraries: talk to people around them and write in the books. When someone finds a book which means a lot to them they can borrow a pencil and write their name on labels inserted in the books. The library, its walls made from liquid porcelain, includes the work of almost 1,500 writers from 58 countries in dozens of languages and is still growing with people encouraged to suggest new titles. After six months at the British Museum the books in the library will be donated to the library of the University of Mosul in Iraq, which is being rebuilt after it was burned to the ground in 2015 by Isis. A million books were lost. De Waal is an artist best known to some for his beautiful porcelain pots. To others he might be better known as a writer, particularly for his internationally bestselling memoir The Hare with Amber Eyes in which he used his inheritance of 264 Japanese netsuke from his great-uncle Iggie to trace the fortunes of his ancestors, the Ephrussis, one of the richest of Europe’s Jewish banking families. He said he was spurred by the library of his great-grandfather, which was looted by the Nazis. “I needed to make a new library. I needed to do something incredibly positive. It was a feeling of: ‘How can I do something which is generative and positive against a landscape of polarisation and rhetoric?’ “It is the most personal and significant thing I’ve done. It feels like a bit of beautiful activism really.”"
"British-Ghanaian fashion model and activist Adwoa Aboah, born in 1992 in London, has featured on the covers of Vogue and Time and has a Barbie doll designed in her honour. In 2015, she founded Gurls Talk, an online community for all women to discuss mental health, body image, addiction and sexuality. Gurls Talk recently launched a podcast with guests including Serena Williams and Jorja Smith. Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo I’m an avid reader, so Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other caught my eye in the bookshop. It’s phenomenal. Even though the stories cover different eras and places, her ability to form such solid characters really spoke to me as a woman of colour. And because the stories were set in England, it felt really close to home. She tackles so many of the challenges that women face today but in a beautiful non-cliche way. She’s a professor at Brunel — that’s where I went to university - and I felt a moment of pride. Billie Eilish: No Time to Die Billie Eilish doing the James Bond theme song at just 18 years old is something that needs to be celebrated. It’s great to watch her check these huge accomplishments off her list. No Time to Die is great — I saw her perform it at the Brits and it was beautiful. There is something about her that is really authentic. She’s risen to fame while she’s navigating through her teen years, and that has its problems but she’s really honest about it all through her music. I’m a fan of her energy. Queen & Slim This has the whole package; the music, the way it was shot, the direction. Jodie Turner-Smith is the star and is a new face in acting. It’s nice to see someone being given the chance to shine. I love how the film explored the romance between men and women. Women are moving forward in major ways and don’t need what we used to from men because we have our own independence. But I love that the film explores this idea of letting go of the ego. I’m all for fresh new things and this film really felt like that. Paloma Elsesser for Fendi I haven’t really got involved in fashion month this past season; it can be a trigger because it’s based so heavily on what we look like. There’s rejection involved. But [plus-size US model] Paloma Elsesser has been a shining light in all of that. To see her killing it on the Fendi catwalk has been great. I just hope that it isn’t tokenism and they’re including her because they care and not just because they want to be part of the conversation [on inclusivity]. She deserves to be up there with the other girls. Anything she’s part of, I want to be part of too. Cheer (Netflix) Cheer had me on my sofa trying to do backflips. It’s a docu-series about competitive cheerleading and it made me so happy. I love the community that it was highlighting. I think everyone should watch it. I’m passionate about women at the top of their game in terms of sport, because I do a lot of sports myself. I felt inspired. I also got to meet the cast and had such a fan-girl moment. It’s talent at its best. I’m obsessed with people who are obsessed with what they do. #MeToo The Harvey Weinstein verdict really put into perspective what is important. Seeing women you don’t know finding the strength to stand up and share their story, you have to find a connection in that. I’m happy that justice has been served for those individual women. But it’s also a win for those who are all still out there and now feel like they can come forward. It doesn’t matter about how powerful a person is, courage tops it all. A new time is on its way. Maybe this is a new era."
"Native Americans whose ancestors suffered at the hands of 17th-century European settlers and adventurers are hoping commemorative events marking the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower’s journey will reveal their story to the whole world – and even lead to the recovery of one their long-lost treasures. A year-long series of exhibitions, performances and community events will be centred on the Devon port of Plymouth, four centuries after the ship set sail for North America, and thousands of people from both sides of the Atlantic are expected to take part. Organisers say that the close involvement of members of the Wampanoag nation, whose ancestors were all but wiped out following the arrival of the colonists in 1620, is crucial to the success of the project. “We’re very pleased to be standing up as equals on an international platform to tell our story,” said Paula Peters, who is a member of the Wampanoag and sits on an advisory committee helping shape the British commemoration. “So often the story of the Mayflower is just about the boat. The Mayflower lands and the pilgrims are depicted as founders, not takers,” she said. For Peters’ ancestors, it was very different: a brutal tale of disease, enslavement and massacre. But it is not just about looking back, Peters said. “The commemoration also gives us the opportunity to remind the world who we are and that we are still here. We are a viable and very active nation of indigenous people.” One of the most eye-catching commemoration projects is the exhibition of an ornate wampum (shell bead) belt, which is being created by more than 100 Wampanoag people. Patterns on the belt made out of thousands of quahog (clam) shells tell the story of the Wampanoag through symbols such as whale, deer, fish and a creation tree. The belt has been worked on at powwows and other gatherings in Massachusetts since July and will be complete by February. It will be a star attraction in a show that will tour UK cities connected to the Mayflower from April, led by the city’s new cultural centre The Box. Peters hopes the making of the belt may prompt the return of an old one, that of the Wampanoag chief Metacom. It has not been seen since it was taken to England in 1677 following the bloody King Philip’s War between Native Americans and colonists. “We continue to look for this belt,” said Peters. “It’s not just a treasure, it’s our story. It could be in England still, perhaps in a private collection. It may be pie in the sky but we hope the tour of our new belt may jog someone’s memory. That’s a tangible thing that could come out of all this.” Julia Marden, the weaving manager for the new belt, and a specialist in eastern woodland art, said she was honoured to be part of the project. “We’re getting as many tribal members as possible involved,” she said. Marden, who is also a member of the Wampanoag, said she supported the idea not of recovering the Metacom belt, but seeing others held in places such as the British Museum handed back. “As an indigenous person I would say we want it all back, but we’re realistic. We know we’re not going to get it all back.” Marden also said she hoped the commemoration would remind the world that the Wampanoag people and other Native Americans were still around. “We’re hidden in plain sight,” she said. “If we’re not living in a teepee or riding a horse on the plains we’re not recognisable but we’re your neighbours, your co-workers, we go to school with you.” Among the other commemorative events in Devon involving Native Americans is a community theatre piece called This Land, which wrestles with the history of the Mayflower and the impact of its arrival. It is to be performed and created with hundreds of residents of Plymouth in the UK and members of the Wampanoag people and will feature songs written and performed by the Devon folk artist Seth Lakeman. Another intriguing project is Settlement, billed as a collaboration between a Plymouth collective and the Native American artist Cannupa Hanska Luger. It will involve Native American artists “occupying” Plymouth’s Central Park to explore colonialism. Charles Hackett, the chief executive of Mayflower 400, said Native Americans had been missing from previous UK commemorations. “This is not a story about a boat leaving one place and arriving in another place,” he said. “It is a story that has a huge sweep of history.” Hackett said the arrival of the Mayflower was a seismic moment in the creation of what is now the west, but was cataclysmic for the Wampanoag people. “It’s important we include all the voices that are significant. We won’t get it entirely right. How can you? But we’re committed to doing it better than it was before.”"
"More artists, writers and composers at an early stage of their careers should get public money from Arts Council England, the body’s chairman, Sir Nicholas Serota, has said. The east of England could also benefit from extra investment in the coming years and libraries are set to get more help to play a larger role in their communities. ACE will next month publish its 10-year strategy for the arts outlining its strategic visions and goals. It replaces its previous strategy, Great Art and Culture for Everyone, which covered the years 2010-20. In an interview with the Guardian, Serota recalled a “salutary” survey of 5,000 people who were asked what the arts meant to them, to which a number replied “not very much”. People were also asked if they listened to music and replied “all the time”.  Serota said: “There’s obviously an idea about the arts which is about it being elitist. In sport they don’t have any difficulty at all in recognising the difference between a knockabout game and the Premier League. They recognise there is the professional game and something they can be involved with on a Sunday morning. “If we could get to the same position in the arts we would be well placed. It [arts and culture] is just something that is part of life rather than something which is over there and separate.” Serota said a priority in the strategy would be “to try to reach those people who are not participating. There are too many places that in order to see something of real quality you have to travel long distances.” That could include more money for the arts in eastern England. “It is interesting, looking at where the big investments have been made in recent years,” Serota said. “Frankly there has been more on the west side of the country than on the east, for various reasons. Manchester has been very successful. If you look up the east coast from the east Midlands to Newcastle … there are a whole range of towns and cities which need further investment.” Helping artists early will be a priority. “It will be about giving more support to writers, artists, composers at an early stage in their career so that they can make a career and then flourish.” He said it was astonishing how many winners of the Mercury music prize had benefited from ACE support early in their careers, and not big sums. “Maybe £10,000 to £15,000 to get help and on their way … it makes a difference at the right moment.” Libraries, which have suffered badly in recent years due to government spending cuts, could get more help. Serota said: “There is big scope when you talk about what is happening in high streets and communities for libraries to play a much larger role. Many are already. Libraries are trusted places. They are places people feel safe in. Sustaining libraries and helping them move into the 21st century is an important part of what the Arts Council should be doing.” Many in the arts are nervous about the future, unsure of the consequences of Brexit, how pro-arts a Boris Johnson government will be, and whether the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport will be scrapped or merged into another government department. Serota said he would be disappointed if the culture department went, but on the whole he was optimistic. “I have to be.” He added: “Brexit will make us have to paddle even harder. The strength of the arts in this country depends partly on international exchange and having good companies work here but also being able to draw on international talent just as countries abroad draw on British talent. The exchange of individuals in that way is very important. “I think Boris did demonstrate he recognised that when he was mayor of London. When he made his first speech as prime minister in Manchester, he mentioned the arts high in his list of priorities. So I think he understands and appreciates the value of the arts in themselves but also the value of what they can bring to communities.” Serota became chair of ACE in 2017 after three decades in charge of Tate galleries. It has meant seeing far more theatre and dance than visual arts previews, which has been a thrill, he said. Asked which shows he had enjoyed recently, he mentioned The Arrival at the Bush theatre in London, Matthew Bourne’s The Red Shoes at Sadler’s Wells and the National Theatre’s production of Three Sisters, a retelling of Chekhov by Inua Ellams that relocates the action to late-1960s Nigeria. It was a really bold production, he said, and a joy “to see the NT filled with a different kind of audience from the one that would normally be there. To see that audience seeing things in that play that a British white audience didn’t understand.”"
"England’s arts chiefs have said they want to create a nation that has better access to culture in every “village, town and city” by 2030, where creativity in each individual is valued and “given the chance to flourish”. Arts Council England (ACE) will publish a 10-year strategy on Monday called Let’s Create, produced after 18 months’ work including numerous workshops, consultations and public conversations involving more than 6,000 people. The strategy, which focuses more on broad-brush aspirations rather than specific statements about levels of funding or support for different art forms, is a new version of one published in 2010, Great Art and Culture for Everyone.  The key differences in the new strategy include more emphasis on supporting people individually and at every stage of their life, championing a wider range of culture, and increasing spending and support for libraries. It also aspires to give communities in every “village, town and city” more opportunity to design and develop the culture on offer there. The strategy lists four principles guiding whether ACE will invest public money: “ambition and quality”, “inclusivity and relevance”, “dynamism”, and “environmental responsibility”. The ACE chief executive, Darren Henley, said he wanted to move away from having centres of excellence in a small number of places and instead bring “world-class art and culture to people’s doorsteps”. He added: “This is setting out our intentions, how we want to see arts and culture in England over a 10-year period. It is not a flick of a switch, it is a journey we are going to go on with audiences, with people who work in arts organisations, libraries, museums and individual artists.” Henley said it had not been developed “by a bunch of bureaucrats sitting in a room on their own” but after a long period of consultation with professionals, audiences and potential audiences. In the report, the ACE chair, Sir Nicholas Serota, uses the example of a 2016 nationwide arts project by Jeremy Deller and Rufus Norris, which he says encapsulates the aims of the 10-year strategy. The project, to mark the centenary of the first world war, involved hundreds of volunteers standing in uniforms, in silence, in places across the UK, representing soldiers who died on the first day of the battle of the Somme. Serota said it embodied boldness, collective creativity, partnerships “and perhaps most important of all, the dissolving of barriers between artists and the audiences with whom they interact”. The report lists a number of important issues requiring action. They include: The report does not identify which areas or arts are likely to get funding changes, although Serota told the Guardian earlier this month that the east of England was likely to benefit more. A delivery plan for the strategy is expected in April. Most people working in England’s arts sector will get their first sight of the strategy on Monday, although five arts policy experts last week pre-empted the report, which they said would contain “vague generalisations” and “arcane art-speak”. Instead, Shelagh Wright, John Holden, John Kieffer, John Newbigin and Robert Hewison published, on the Arts Professional website, an alternative cultural strategy for England which calls on ACE to recover key values such as justice, trust, accountability and risk, “rather than rely on bland outcomes that are so obvious that no one could disagree with them”."
"When the Chicks, the Texas trio of singer Natalie Maines and sisters Emily Strayer and Martie Maguire, abruptly dropped the “Dixie” from their name in late June, they set forth a crystalline, encompassing mantra: “We want to meet this moment.” The band, whose thumping proto-feminist, bluegrass-pop ballads made them the highest-selling female group of all time in the United States, made the decision partly in response to America’s racial reckoning after the death of George Floyd in police custody and partly due to longstanding discomfort with name’s romanticization of the Confederacy. It also mirrors the release of their first new music in 14 years: unbowed, unapologetic yet open to growth, soundtracked by a scorched-earth record of divorce and resilience with a title, Gaslighter, oft-invoked in the Trump presidency. But coverage of Gaslighter invariably invoked another moment, 17 years away. The Chicks’ return and rebrand in 2020 could not be untethered from 2003, when backlash to Maines’s offhand criticism of the then president, George W Bush, in the days before the invasion of Iraq derailed one of country music’s most lucrative and popular acts. Which is why it’s worth revisiting Shut Up and Sing, the documentary which tracked arguably the swiftest backlash in modern pop music, what has become shorthand for career suicide by outspokenness in country music. Shut Up and Sing, directed by Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck, was released in 2006 and recalled the tribulations of the Chicks’ prior three years; the New York Times called it a “sad commentary on pop culture and public relations”, a fly-on-the-wall look at how “reason is drowned out by noise, and there can be hell to pay”. Watching the film now, 14 years and ten thousand layers of internet sediment later, feels like tracing an underground cable to our frenzied, hyper-political, roiling present of the internet’s collapse of scale, political identity and celebrity, the lines between on and offline already blurred and consequential in 2003. The film – all cinéma vérité footage, no talking heads, filmed as the Chicks recoil and recover for a new album and tour from 2003 to 2006 – blazes like a signal flare of cultural strands which have since cemented and metastasized: anonymous harassment campaigns incited online; how mass media greases the tracks for pile-ons; the ferocity with which said campaigns target women (or other marginalized groups – the Chicks were blonde, white women from the south associated with a genre notoriously resistant to non-white, non-male performers – imagine if they weren’t); the conservative dogma of patriotism as unwavering, unquestioning and deeply insecure devotion to military power and jingoism; celebrity statements as arenas for the culture wars (“shut up and sing,” the criticism levied often at Maines, foreshadows Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s derision for LeBron James to “shut up and dribble”). To backtrack: in 2003, the Chicks were on top of the world. They sang the national anthem at the Super Bowl, scored a No 1 record, Home, while their previous record, Fly, remained No 2. There were sold-out arena shows, a lucrative partnership with Lipton Iced Tea, tens of millions of physical album copies sold. That March, the Chicks kicked off their tour in London, as TVs backstage played updates of American troops poised to invade Iraq. After playing their No 1 hit at the time, Travelin’ Soldier, Maines spitballed with the crowd: “Just so you know, we’re on the good side with y’all,” she says. “We do not want this war, this violence. And we’re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.” The crowd cheered, she giggled and they launched into the next song. The scene backstage after the show, captured on camera, is breezy and relieved. But in a strange harbinger of disproportionate, staggeringly targeted repudiations to come, the banter, first quoted by the print Guardian in London and then disseminated by the Associated Press, ricocheted back to the States. Shut Up and Sing traces what becomes a mushroom cloud of recrimination: local news segments quote Maines derisively, a rightwing group called Free Republic demands a boycott of their music and their concerts, radio stations – the backbone of recognition in country music – heed calls to ban their music. Their single plummets from the top 10. Their website, overwhelmed with traffic, is forced to shut down. They return to Texas, and have a roundtable with a Lipton representative concerned for the tea brand. “It’s not about our point of view,” says Emily Strayer, the band’s banjo player, to pressure for a more apologetic or comprehensive apology from the group. “The story is about how out of hand it’s gotten, isn’t it? It’s snowballed.” The snowball kept rolling, and the incident cast a long shadow over country music and its listeners. In her 2020 Netflix documentary Miss Americana, Taylor Swift, a lifelong Chicks fan, cited her fear of getting “Dixie Chick-ed” as the reason why she remained politically reticent – a “good girl”, agreeable – even past the 2016 election; the film returns to Shut Up and Sing like formative bedrock. Even the indomitable Dolly Parton has invoked the incident as a reason to placate rather than provoke. (“Of course I have my opinion about everything, but I learned years ago to keep your mouth shut about things. I saw what happened to the Dixie Chicks,” she told NPR in 2019 for the “Dollitics” episode of the Dolly Parton’s America podcast). Watching the blowback to Maines’s words unfold on screen feels, even in 2020, absurd in its precipitousness, especially for criticism of the president that is now so commonplace in public as to be unrevealing. But in 2003, less than a year and a half removed from 9/11, “political” words against the president by a band supposedly (though as the Chicks say in the film, inaccurately) representing the American heartland curdled with startling momentum. Radio stations set up garbage bins for people to toss their CDs. People protested at their US shows with signs (“shut up dixie twits”) or bedazzled shirts (“I’m only here because I couldn’t get my $$$ back”). The Fox News host Bill O’Reilly called them “callow, foolish women who deserve to be slapped around”, on air. In one horrifyingly mundane sequence, the Chicks are briefed on a death threat against Maines reported for their Dallas concert deemed credible enough to loop in the FBI; fiddler Martie Maguire and Renshaw ponder how someone could easily get a handgun past pat-downs – tucked into their crotch, maybe? Tied to their ankle? The FBI recommends cancelling the show. They don’t. “Everything was so bizarre it was almost humorous,” Maines reflects in the film, just two years removed from the exile. The comment feels as apt now as it probably did then, and one of the film’s enduring fascinations is how it’s at once recognizable in its dynamics – a comment spinning out of control, strangers resorting to their worst impulses, media rehashing the story as one of proportional debate rather than internet-fueled harassment campaign – and of a totally different time. Elements of the backlash to the Chicks seem laughably homespun now – delivering physical CDs to trash cans outside radio stations and running them over with a tractor? Who has the time for that? – even if the outsize anger, especially directed at three women, remains disturbing. The boycotting of the Chicks is often referred to in any article written about the Chicks in the 2010s as one the first internet “cancellations”, but the film reveals, in detail, how this is a misnomer. It’s not so much “cancel culture”, a bogeyman often reductively invoked by powerful people unused to and upset by substantive and consistent challenges to their platform, or an umbrella term more descriptive of the person using it, than an early, visceral, scarring example of a relentless, exacting identity-forming cycle of harassment, that we’ve seen many times since. Maines’s indirect comments about Bush in 2003 now feel airy, quaint; it’s a striking, and hopeful, testament to the engagement and expectations of audiences now that popular music has shifted from a norm of “apolitical” to political authenticity as near-requirement to be taken seriously. That is, with the notable, frustrating exception of country music, from which the Chicks long ago divested. The country music industry in general has, from its overwhelmingly white and male ranks to the queasy attempt by Lady Antebellum to rebrand as Lady A (while suing the black blues singer from Seattle who goes by the name), has failed to meet this moment of reckoning or celebrated the genre’s black roots. Country music radio might be forced to forgive the still-popular Chicks, but the radio scene in Nashville for female and non-white performers remains downright dismal. At 14 years old, Shut Up and Sing acts like an old mirror – clear, if warped – a strange reflection for a band that has grown up and on, even as country music has struggled to follow suit; an artifact of stricter bounds for critiques of power, the mechanisms for online rage less baked in. In press for Gaslighter, Maguire told NPR that she recently allowed her teenage daughters to watch the film for the first time. “They’re like, ‘I don’t get it. Why couldn’t you say that? Why couldn’t she say that?’” They were confused by a time graspable but mostly gone. “Things have changed so much, and that is not their world,” she said, though I’d argue Shut Up and Sing shows the path to this one."
"A worn metal tool with a hefty-looking handle, a delicate gadget with pedals, arms and cogs, and a piece of glassware with a snail-like coil in the middle. They might seem a motley collection of objects but they have one thing in common – they are all mysteries. The objects are among the 7.3m items, from photographs to devices, that form the collection of the Science Museum Group. Curators are seeking the public’s help to solve the puzzle of what these items were used for, and the stories behind them. Many of the mysterious items have come to light amid the transportation of 300,000 objects from Blythe House in London to a purpose-built facility at the Science Museum Group’s National Collections Centre in Wiltshire. “As part of that move we are having to look at and handle and inventory, and photograph every object stored at Blythe House,” said Jessica Bradford, the keeper of collection engagement at the Science Museum. “It is like one giant house move project but with the added excitement that these objects are part of the national collection, and that they have incredible stories to tell.” Bradford said discoveries have already been made by the team over the course of the project, which began in 2018, through detective work. This ranged from hunting through records to looking at the items a particular object was stored with.  Among the revelations was an understanding of a Chinese incense clock – a device with small square, metal tray and maze-like stencils – that had been something of a head scratcher – until a curator who had spent time in China had a look. The mazes, it seemed, were used to create a trail of incense that would burn for a specific length of time. “Essentially, the way it works is that the incense is burned and there are different fragrances and different fragrant notes throughout the incense wick,” said Bradford. These scent-based, time-measuring devices were often used during rituals or ceremonies, she added. But the stories of many other objects have yet to be uncovered. “In some cases we reach a dead end and that is where it would be amazing to see whether the wider public, the hive mind of the public, can help us unpick some of these mysteries,” said Bradford. Among the mystery objects is a gadget with a base like a hat stand and a hook at the top, a semi-circular scoop-like device on a handle, and a metal object in a silken box that is said to be an air purifier presented to Pope Leo XIII. The latter two items are part of the Wellcome Collection, a huge, eclectic array of objects gathered together by Sir Henry Wellcome, who died in 1936, that is cared for by the Science Museum Group. “Often the only thing we know about the object is what, potentially, Henry Wellcome himself will have known about it when it was sold to him or brought to him by one of his agents, or presented at auction,” said Bradford, adding that is likely the source of the information about the “air purifier”. Since Wellcome is drawn to strange and curious objects, Bradford said there could be many surprising items. “They are likely to be the kind of thing that maybe only one or two people in the world have ever seen before, because that is the kind of thing that he was after, he was after the edges of the human experience,” she said.  The questions marks also extend to images, among them a portrait of a bewigged man holding a book open at a picture of a skeleton. At one point it had been attributed to Gainsborough, and was said to be of the Scottish anatomist and physician Dr William Hunter. But the style of the painting and the clothes of the sitter reveal neither identity is correct. The team are turning to the public to help shed light on the mystery items, including 10 objects featured in a Guardian gallery. They encourage those with an inkling to drop the team a line either on Twitter (@sciencemuseum) or via email mysteryobject@sciencemuseum.ac.uk. “These 10 objects are 10 great examples of the opportunity to help us solve mysteries, but there are many, many more,” said Bradford.

"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all When I told a friend I was writing about the first reality TV show, they WhatsApped back: “Surely the news is the first reality show?” Ooh, deep! But also: absolutely not. The news is well-researched reporting and facts about important, life-changing events. Reality TV is the opposite. An important point: don’t get confused between reality TV and “structured reality”, which came along in 2004 with Laguna Beach, then snowballed into The Hills, Jersey Shore, Towie, Keeping Up With the Kardashians and the 800 Real Housewives spin-offs. Structured reality is set-up situations where casts row until someone chucks a drink. Reality TV is ordinary people in real-life situations, whether those situations are playing out in a house, a jungle or on an island. So you are probably thinking Big Brother was the first reality TV show. First aired in 1999 in the Netherlands, the format came to the UK in 2000 and we all played along with the idea it was a social experiment until Craig caught Nasty Nick passing notes and it all kicked off – possibly the moment that show bosses realised that its 4 million viewers weren’t tuning in to see the housemates make pottery or read books; they wanted drama. But even as Big Brother veered towards structured reality with tasks designed to cause conflict, viewers clung on to the smaller, more “real” moments: Helen and Paul’s forbidden romance; Jade and PJ’s undercover fumble; drunk Alex dancing behind the door in series three. When Channel 4 tried to pull it back to a psychological study in 2003, it was branded “the most boring series ever”. Of course, the US was way ahead of the UK with MTV’s The Real World, which started in 1992 and was about what happens when strangers who live together “stop being polite and start being real”. However, the first reality show was actually 1973’s An American Family. The cameras moved in ostensibly to document the everyday life of, er, an American family, but ended up breaking it up – with 10 million people watching as mum Pat complained about husband Bill’s cheating, moaned about their sex life and then, midway through filming, asked him for a divorce on camera. And although it sounds bleak, it did have a semi-happy ending: son Lance became an LGBT activist and Pat and Bill eventually moved back in together as “roommates” but never remarried. The cameras, strangely, weren’t invited. One year later, we got a British spin-off, The Family. In the first episode, the Wilkins family from Reading were warned: “It’ll be a huge invasion of your privacy … we can film you any time, anywhere.” Horrified viewers saw mum Margaret and dad Terry fighting over their children, cheating and money – and although 8 million people tuned in to see oldest daughter Marion marry fiance Tom, the show was later parodied on Monty Python as “The Most Awful Family in Britain 1974”. Everyone on the show is now divorced, dead or desperately trying to forget their reality show past. At the time, Margaret said the family agreed to do it not for the money but so viewers had the chance to “see ordinary people on telly”. Margaret: this is all your fault."
"The organiser of an open letter decrying “a vogue for public shaming and ostracism” has said companies such as Netflix and the New York Times will have to take into account the views of its signatories, after a counter letter accused the first letter’s backers of failing to recognise those “silenced for generations”. A debate about free speech, privilege and the role of social media in public discourse continued over the weekend as the writer Thomas Chatterton Williams, who signed the first letter along with more than 150 prominent authors, thinkers and journalists including JK Rowling, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, argued that it had “moved the needle”. Speaking to NPR, Chatterton Williams said: “Someone has to look around and say: ‘Well, actually, a lot of these people on the list I do still want to work with. I do still want to make Netflix adaptations of some of their work. I do still want them to make podcasts or report at the New York Times or the New Yorker,’” he said. “‘And so I have to take into consideration their point of view too, not just these kind of whipped up mobs online that are faceless.’” The letter, which was published in Harper’s Magazine on Tuesday and signed by cultural figures also including Noam Chomsky, Malcolm Gladwell and Gloria Steinem, said the spread of “censoriousness” was leading to “an intolerance of opposing views” and “a vogue for public shaming and ostracism”. On Friday a counter letter signed by 160 journalists and academics said the signatories of the Harper’s letter were writing from a position of privilege. “They miss the point: the irony of the piece is that nowhere in it do the signatories mention how marginalised voices have been silenced for generations in journalism, academia and publishing,” they wrote in a response published in the newsletter the Objective. “The signatories, many of them white, wealthy, and endowed with massive platforms, argue that they are afraid of being silenced, that so-called cancel culture is out of control, and that they fear for their jobs and free exchange of ideas, even as they speak from one of the most prestigious magazines in the country.” At least two original signatories of the first letter distanced themselves from it after they saw the names of others who had signed. Asked about the accusation that signatories included people accused of transphobia, such as Rowling, Chatterton Williams said: “I think that part of what the letter is trying to do is trying to argue against the idea that you have to look around and Google every statement that anybody on the list has ever said to know if you feel comfortable signing it. The point is that that’s irrelevant.” Billy Bragg, who in the Guardian on Friday said the George Orwell quote etched on the outside of the BBC – “if liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear” – made him cringe because it was “not a defence of liberty” but rather “a demand for licence”, said it was hypocritical to defend free speech while decrying “online mobs”. “The so-called Twitter mob is nothing more than a bunch of individuals exercising their right to freedom of expression,” he said. “I am not against free speech, it’s the absolute foundation of a free society, but it has to be balanced with accountability and respect for the views of others.”"
"The wealth of performances, whether brand new or archival, available online over the last four months has been wonderfully restorative. But much of what has been on offer has tended to be mainstream; anyone wanting something more challenging or iconoclastic could have been disappointed. Certainly the specially written lockdown pieces I’ve sampled, whether from the UK or farther afield, have been disappointingly thin. Distance/Intimacy, the festival of new music from the Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin, curated by Daniel Barenboim and flautist Emmanuel Pahud, was a wonderful example of what can be done. Ten specially commissioned pieces were presented in four concerts across four nights (online until 12 August), framed by platform discussions with Pahud and Barenboim, and sometimes the composers, too, and each concert began with a piece by Boulez. The first was the early flute Sonatine, given a performance of steadily mounting intensity by Pahud and pianist Denis Kozhukhin; the ensemble pieces Messagesquisse, Mémoriale and Dérive I followed on successive evenings. The commissions themselves were a mixed bag. Michael Jarrell, Philippe Manoury and Christian Rivet all wrote works for solo flute – wonderfully played by Pahud, but otherwise unremarkable. Of the others, the most striking were Johannes Boris Borowski’s Sphinxes for piano quartet and percussion, creating a world of glinting shards and explosive flurries, Irina Amargianaki’s Eumeniden, setting a passage from The Oresteia of Aeschylus, and Olga Neuwirth’s coronAtion II: Naufraghi del mondo che hanno ancora un cuore – cinque isola della fatica, an unwieldy title for a quintet for piano, strings and wind that dispersed the instrumentalists around the performing space before bringing them together for the work’s final resolution. Browsing elsewhere I found two treasurable performances by the great German tenor Fritz Wunderlich, who would have been 90 this year. One features Wunderlich as a heart-stoppingly touching Lensky in a production of Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin, sung in German, from the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1962, conducted by Josef Keilberth with Ingeborg Bremmert as Tatyana, Herman Prey as Onegin, and Brigitte Fassbaender as Olga. The other, sound only, has Wunderlich taking the solo tenor part in a performance of Stravinsky’s melodrama Perséphone, in German again rather than the original French. but bringing a vocal heft and lyrical intensity you rarely hear in this masterpiece of Stravinsky’s neoclassical period. Finally, a tour de force from the violinist Malin Broman. A performance of the final Presto of Mendelssohn’s Octet – even one as thrilling as this – may not in itself be particularly noteworthy, except that Broman herself plays all eight string parts, violins, violas and cellos, in what is not just an outstanding demonstration of musical versatility but a marvel of multi-tracking, too. My picks for the week ahead This week’s lunchtime concerts from Glasgow City Halls, all broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and streamed on the City Halls website, may not be as extensive as June’s Wigmore series, and were certainly launched with less of a fanfare, but arguably they offer more adventurous and varied programmes. The bass-baritone Michael Mofidian, accompanied by Julia Lynch, begins the series on 14 July with Tchaikovsky, Ravel and Vaughan Williams; Steven Osborne plays Schubert’s last piano sonata, the B flat D960, and tenor Thomas Walker is partnered by harpsichordist John Butt in a Handel-centred programme, while percussionist Colin Currie ranges from Per Nørgård and Bryce Dessner to Toshio Hosokawa and Xenakis, via Stockhausen and Kevin Volans. And on Friday, the 2020 BBC Proms begin. We’ve been promised six weeks of recordings from the Proms archive on Radio 3 and BBC4 before a final fortnight of live concerts performed in an empty Royal Albert Hall. Some details are still vague, but we do know that the opening night will include a specially commissioned mash-up of the Beethoven symphonies by Iain Farrington, a reprise of the premiere of Harrison Birtwistle’s Panic, which so scandalised the Last Night audience in 1995, as well as Claudio Abbado’s unforgettable performance of Mahler’s Third Symphony with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra from 2007."
"Visitors are finally returning to one of the UK’s most glorious buildings, Salisbury Cathedral, where they will be met by sights and sounds ranging from a shimmering Antony Gormley figure perched high above the choir to peregrine falcons on the tower. The cathedral believes that from Wednesday it will be able to welcome 600 visitors a day, well down on the 1,000 or so it would expect to greet on a normal busy summer’s day, but a huge boost for a building that depends on the income tourists bring. It has put in a range of safety measures including a one-way system that has the bonus of taking visitors past the works yard, where stonemasons can be spotted hammering and chipping away. Visitors must book online in advance and stay 2 metres apart. The cathedral shop and refectory are not yet ready to be opened but people will be able to enjoy a takeaway on the lawns from the Bell Tower Tea Rooms. “We can’t wait to welcome visitors back,” said Jane Morgan, the cathedral’s director of communications and development, who is overseeing the plans for reopening. “This building was designed to attract people to it. It just doesn’t feel right when it’s empty. We know people are keen to get back in. Coming to a place like this can feel like arriving in a place of refuge.” The income that visitors bring in is crucial as it costs £14,000 a day to run the cathedral. Morgan said: “Our visitors are vital to our survival. We receive no regular funding from government in normal times, or from the church, so we have felt their absence greatly in recent months. They play a key role keeping this national treasure going.” In March, the cathedral was days away from launching an exhibition, its largest contemporary show for almost two decades, to mark the 800th anniversary of the building’s move to its present site when lockdown struck. Almost four months on, visitors will finally be able to view the exhibition, called Spirit and Endeavour, featuring works by the likes of Gormley, Mark Wallinger, Grayson Perry and Youki Hirakawa carefully installed in nooks and crannies around the cathedral. The Gormley figure, GRIP (Net) can – just about – be spotted on an arch above the choir. Made out of fine webs of stainless steel, from some angles and in some lights the figure almost vanishes into the building’s fabric. “For me it, shimmers,” said Jacquiline Creswell, the cathedral’s curator and visual arts adviser. “It feels like a celebration of the people who built this cathedral – strong but also fragile.” The morning chapel is graced by a 30-minute Hirakawa video showing a candle slowly burning down. “It makes me think of resurrection and renewal,” said Creswell. Grayson Perry’s tapestry Death of a Working Hero is given a prominent place in the nave. It was inspired by the ceremony of the blessing of trade union banners in another great cathedral, Durham. A Wallinger video, Threshold to the Kingdom, is projected on to the stonework of the the Trinity Chapel and feel apposite. Filmed covertly, it shows air passengers arriving into a terminal. Some passengers are greeted and hugged while others walk off out of shot. “It’s so moving, especially in a time when we aren’t allowed to hug people,” Creswell said. There are more exhibits outside, including a Henry Moore. Look up and the visitor may see the peregrine falcons, which have nested successfully. But there are vivid reminders that these are not ordinary times. A notice in the north transept asks people to pray for everyone who has suffered because of Covid-19. People are asked to sanitise their hands before lighting a candle. The Chapter House, home to the 1215 Magna Carta, one of only four in the world, will remain closed for the time being, but a near-perfect facsimile is on display in the main building. Some curiosities being given prominence for the reopening include the rather gruesome remains of a rat that was found in the skull of William Longespée, the earl of Salisbury, who was present at the laying of the cathedral’s foundations. The rodent has been moved out of the Chapter House and, appropriately, placed beside Longespée’s tomb."
"“Folks, for four years, we’ve looked on in horror as Donald Trump tore down every norm in American life, from the constitution, to English syntax, to the definition of the food pyramid,” said Stephen Colbert in his first live show since the pandemic drove him from the studio in March. The Late Show host reacted in real time to the first night of the (virtual) Democratic national convention, in which Democrats launched what Colbert termed “America Endgame”. The convention’s first night featured a hodgepodge of pre-filmed segments from a variety of celebrities and political figures, including former Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich, who delivered a message underlining the convention’s theme, “uniting America”. The line, Colbert noted, is “slightly more inspiring than the Republican convention theme: ‘Gas protesters and throw mailboxes into the sea.’” Another common refrain of the evening was “we the people”, which ordinary citizens from around the nation echoed in recorded videos. “You know how when you repeat something over and over again, it starts to lose all meaning?” Colbert said of the convention’s invocation. “This is the exact opposite of that.” The repetition left Colbert “deeply moved, not just because some of my best friends are people”, he said. “It’s because this feels like the real beginning of the election. And a chance for the American people to do the work that our elected officials failed to do for the last four years, and that’s hold Donald Trump accountable.” It’s like you’re in the middle of a road trip, Colbert explained, “and you realized Dad’s lost and we have to take the wheel – and also send Dad to jail for stealing the car.” Former first lady Michelle Obama delivered the keynote address, in which she offered what Colbert joked was the “strongest possible endorsement” for Joe Biden: “I know Joe.” “Good enough for me!” Colbert shouted. “Release the balloons! He knows Michelle Obama!” For the first time, the political party conventions are going virtual, which means, “no crowds, no dancing, no balloon drops, and definitely no Bill Clinton kissing booth,” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. “Honestly, I’m looking forward to watching speeches without the crowd cheering every other sentence,” Noah added. But on the other hand, “we all have to admit that a convention which takes place over Zoom just doesn’t have the same juice. Like, imagine if Obama had to do one of his favorite speeches, but on Zoom.” From progressives such as Senator Bernie Sanders to John Kasich and other Republicans who have defected from the party backing Trump, the convention’s first night was “meant to showcase the broader appeal of Joe Biden across the political spectrum”, Noah explained. Joe Biden is “basically the Cheerios of presidential candidates”, he added. “He’s not the most exciting option, but deep down, you know he’s good for you.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers took a closer look at the Trump administration’s attempts to privatize or otherwise undercut the US postal service in the run-up to an election that will probably depend on mail-in ballots. “Even before Donald Trump’s rise to power, there was a decades-long effort by rightwing billionaires and dead-eyed corporate husks to privatize the post office,” Meyers said, despite polls demonstrating the post office is the single most popular government agency. The Trump administration’s escalation of calls to privatize the post office aren’t new, Meyers explained. “It’s been a goal of the conservative movement for years. They want to turn one of America’s most cherished institutions into a chain restaurant where you can buy a pack of stamps and unlimited breadsticks.” A central tenet of the privatization argument is that the post office is a poorly run business that loses money, as summed up by the Fox Business host Trish Regan, who tweeted “it’s just a bad business! Poorly run. Loses billions … we need to make it more accountable, not keep throwing money at it.” “Yeah, but it’s not a business!” Meyers corrected. “So telling that you ghouls never say stuff like this about Ice or the police. The Pentagon has had more flops than Johnny Depp but you guys still love throwing money at it.” Also, the post office was profitable, and would be today, if not for a law passed by the Republican Congress in 2006 which mandated the agency to pre-fund 75 years of health benefits and pensions in a decade, something neither the government nor private companies are required to do. Which means, Meyers said, that “the same Republicans who are now complaining that the post office loses money are the ones responsible for the post office losing money.”"
"All week, memes and scorn from Trump’s much-maligned interview with Axios’s Jonathan Swan have circled on social media and in headlines, which is “why Trump rarely steps outside his rightwing media bubble”, said Seth Meyers on Wednesday. “His brain is pureed cottage cheese and he can’t withstand the slightest scrutiny and, inside the bubble, the ghouls who profit off of him can make him seem alive so they can keep partying at his cool house.” But when he does dabble outside the rightwing media sphere, the Late Night host continued, “we end up with Jonathan Swan from Axios looking like a tourist who just watched a Times Square Elmo drop his pants and take a shit on the sidewalk.” Meyers recapped some of the most head-scratching moments from the 37-minute sit-down, including Trump’s attempt to deter Swan’s follow-up questions on America’s dismal coronavirus statistics by handing the journalist “the fakest-ass-looking chart I’ve ever seen – it’s just four random bars in different colors”, said Meyers. “Is this the printer test sheet?” Though the bar chart did look “like a prop they’d give a fourth-grader playing a businessman in a school play”, the craziest part of the interview, according to Meyers, was that Trump – floundering with a stack of papers, saying the US is “lowest in numerous categories, we’re lowest in the world” – “couldn’t even remember his own bullshit. That’s how fried his brain is – he wanted to say our case fatality rate is the lowest in the world, which would be wrong and misleading anyway, but he couldn’t even remember that.” Even Trump’s usual media allies recognized this interview was a disaster, Meyers concluded, and played a clip from the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh’s show. “I don’t know why he did it,” Limbaugh said of the interview, since Axios is not from “the friendly side of the aisle”. “At this point, ‘friendly side of the aisle’, just means ‘anyone who won’t ask a follow-up question,’” said Meyers. “You know it’s bad when even the president’s allies talk about him the way they would warn a child to stay away from strangers. They talk about legitimate journalists like they’re pulling up outside the White House in a windowless van.” After his disastrous Axios interview, Trump “cocooned himself with the weighted blanket that is Fox & Friends”, said Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show. The return to his beloved softball morning show after Axios and another widely mocked interview with Fox News’s Chris Wallace demonstrated how Trump “basically tried dating other shows then ended up back with his ex”, Fallon joked. The 53-minute ramble to Fox & Friends went “pretty much how you’d expect”, Fallon added – at one point, Trump tried to instill fear over mail-in voting for the November election, claiming such a practice would delay results for “months and months, actually could be for years”. “Months or years? It’s an election, not the results of a Covid test,” Fallon retorted. The morning show also asked Trump about reports that he’s considered giving his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential ticket from the White House instead of the convention in Florida; Trump said such a decision would be “easiest from the standpoint of security” in a “beautiful setting” where he’s spent a lot of time. No mention of coronavirus. “Basically, Trump’s message is: ‘Nobody should worry about the virus,’” Fallon deadpanned. “‘Anyway, totally unrelated, I’ll be giving my speech from home.’”"
"The British Museum is to reopen most of its ground-floor galleries on 27 August after being shut for 163 days, its longest peacetime closure. The museum, which first opened its doors in 1759, announced on Friday that it would reopen in time for England’s August bank holiday weekend. It will be one of the last of Britain’s big museums to reopen in a staggered process that began with the National Gallery on 8 July. As at other museums, visitors will need to book a timed slot. Numbers will be reduced and it will feel very different from the usual heaving crowds. Last year there was a 7% increase in visits to 6,239,983, making it the most visited attraction in the UK. Once inside, visitors will follow a single, one-way route that will allow them to see more than 9,000 objects, the museum said, including some of the most popular exhibits such as the Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon Marbles, the Aztec double-headed serpent, the Akan Drum and the Discobolus. Tickets will be available to book from 12 August. Huge demand is likely. The museum’s director, Hartwig Fischer, said: “Visitors are our lifeblood, and we have missed them greatly. It will be wonderful to welcome them back and I do hope that local, London-wide and UK audiences will take this opportunity to discover, or rediscover, the museum, exploring some of the most popular galleries in what will be a much quieter environment.” Initially, only ground-floor galleries will be open, meaning collections that cover ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome and Assyria before moving into Africa, Mexico, North America and the Enlightenment gallery. The artist Grayson Perry has agreed to lend a work that was the centrepiece of his exhibition at the museum nine years ago. Titled Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman, it is an elaborate, fabulously decorated iron coffin ship. Curators hope to display the work in room 17, next to the Nereid Monument from western Turkey, built around 390BC. The museum is reopening cautiously. For the first two days, hours will be 10am-3pm. From Saturday 29 August it will be open 10am-5pm. It plans to reopen some of the upper-floor galleries from 21 September. The museum also announced new dates and extended runs for postponed exhibitions. Tantra: enlightenment to revolution will run from 24 September to 24 January, and Arctic: culture and climate will run from 22 October to 21 February. The display of Edmund de Waal’s library of exile in room 2 has also been extended. The museum said there had been a lot of hard work by staff to get the “splendid yet complex” building back into service. It pointed to objects such as the Lewis chess pieces or Nimrud ivories, which are especially vulnerable to fluctuations in temperature or humidity. “The presence of visitors plays an important part in keeping that humidity stable and we need to be careful as the objects reacclimatise during this first phase of reopening,” the museum said. Fischer added: “The British Museum’s extraordinary collection is a unique place to learn about the shared and complex history of humankind, with its many achievements and challenges, conflicts and innovations. It demonstrates humanity’s ability to endure and create even in precarious times. It will inspire us as we embark on this new chapter in the story of the museum, and the world.”"
"Jane Birkin began keeping a diary aged 11, with the entries addressed to her beloved stuffed toy Munkey. She was born in London; her mother was an actor and her father a spy during the second world war. Birkin’s concerns, initially, were typically teenage – boarding school, boys – but quickly become more juicy: aged 18, she married the James Bond composer John Barry; a year later, she appeared in Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blowup. In her 20s, she became involved (creatively and romantically) with the French musician Serge Gainsbourg and set out on a lifelong path of singing, acting, writing and being one of the most renowned muses of the 20th century and beyond. Now 73, she lives in Paris with her bulldog – regularly seeing her daughters Charlotte Gainsbourg and Lou Doillon, who are both actors and musicians; her oldest daughter Kate Barry, a photographer, died in 2013. Munkey Diaries: 1957-1982 is published this month. Can you introduce Munkey?Ahhhh, I think my father’s brother won him in a raffle. It might have been at a pub. He was very jaunty with his beard and jockey cap, a rather gaudy character. And I adored him, so my Munkey became something that was a part of all our lives. My father had his pyjamas. Serge had a pair of his jeans. My daughters had capes that were made by my grandmother, therefore that counted as magical clothing because they were made before I was 14. I left my Munkey with my father or Serge when they had an operation. We never took an aeroplane without Munkey. We never took a train without Munkey. And you never lost him?Amazing! For me who lost nearly everything. And he got better with the years, because his face on the cover of [Serge Gainsbourg album Histore de] Melody Nelson is much more attractive than when I first got him. So by the time Serge died [in 1991], the children – Kate and Charlotte – were so distressed, I didn’t know what to put in the coffin that would make the children feel that he might be a bit safer. So I ran back home and I got my Munkey and I put him in with Serge. Which is a crazy thing to do, but better than to have lost him in a stupid hotel or to have any other idiot thing that could have happened to him. You have kept a diary for most of your life – what do you like about them?My parents gave me a diary, like lots of little girls. And I gave my girls diaries as well. I mean, I gave them secret diaries with padlocks, but in fact, mine were just exercise books. And it’s a rather good thing to keep, because you can have a good laugh later on about the tiny things that made you miserable. You were more inclined to record the bad things that happened?Well, I think that diaries are very unfair. Because one has a tendency of writing when you’re sad; when you’re happy, you’ve got lots of better things to do. When I read them, I find myself extremely tiresome. It must have been such a drag for John Barry to come back home and there you’ve got this waif-like 17-year-old who is there running his bath, giving him his newspaper. When I look back at that I think: oh my god... I only saw my side of the story. Was it different with Serge Gainsbourg?I really came into my own with Serge because he did nothing all day long but think of jolly things to do with me. So I was extremely happy. He was as jealous as I was. And although now people consider him as really quite a genius in France, which indeed he was, he was never a boring genius. He never said: “Well, now I’m going to go up to work.” I never saw him work. No, when I did rather bad films, he had a tendency of writing his best stuff because he was pissed off that I was not there. He used to come on to all the film sets, then sit miserably in the hotel bedroom where he wrote The Man With the Cabbage Head or Melody Nelson. In that way it was a rather ideal 13 years. There’s a story in the book about how you threw yourself in the Seine after an argument with Gainsbourg. You describe him as a fan of “grand gestures” – would you say the same thing about yourself?As we were both plastered, the grand gestures came rather easily. Also, not being too stupid, I realised I’d done something so outrageous that I had to do something pretty enormous to win him back again. What did your daughters think of your diaries?Neither of them read them. Lou said in a rather frank interview she gave: “Who’d want to read their mother’s diary?” That said it all. Put me in my place. What book would you recommend for a young person?Well, I’d say they should discover Graham Greene. My favourite book is The Heart of the Matter, or Brighton Rock; they should read Brighton Rock immediately. Didn’t you meet Greene?Yes, I did his play Carving a Statue when I was 17 and he was involved in the casting. He had an extraordinary face, his eyes were so blue, it was like looking straight through to a blue sky through a skull. What was the last really good book that you read?I have just read Les Misérables, [Victor] Hugo, which I’d never read before. I’d started [it] I don’t know how many times, so I thought I’d plunge in. All the characters are wonderful, one sort of knew them, but they’re even better when you read them. And you find all the bits of Paris that you didn’t know, or rather you did know but these people lived there. You have to put up with him being a bit historical, so I used to jump little bits. But then in War and Peace I used to jump a little bit of war as well."
"I hate watching comedy. I know, it’s weird for someone who has performed as a comedian for a decade and a half to say that. But I don’t like it, largely because I’ve been a comedian so long. I’ve got so much experience working as an improviser, standup, musical comedian and haunted cabaret Shrek clown that when I see someone else perform comedy there are only two outcomes for me.1. I pick the joke before it arrives and find the experience tedious. 2. I don’t pick the joke before it arrives and instead become extraordinarily envious that I didn’t think of such an excellent joke first. I am largely immune to comedy but that’s not to say I don’t find things on the internet funny. I do, it’s just that they’re often really weird and creepy or displays of hubris, idiocy or misfortune. What’s not to love about this gentleman? Witness as he strikes his pose on a winter’s day. Marvel at his defiant proclamations and announcement of his new band. Observe as he launches himself, coccyx first, towards the frozen pool. Nothing warms my shrivelled heart more than seeing a grown man get owned by a child. Particularly if the man is trying to be a cool hip dude talking about fireworks. What is the smelliest food in the world? That’s a question I happen to know the answer to: surströmming. It’s Swedish for sour herring. Basically, they put the herring in tins with juuuuuuust a tiny bit of salt. Just enough salt to stop the fish from completely rotting. They they leave the almost rotting fish in the tin for at least six months. Then this guy opens it in his car. This kid is going to be so pissed. I am fascinated by the exploits of the internet’s many subcultures. I’m especially fond of those folks who get a hold of old Furbies and modify them to have really long bodies. They’re just so dang elegant. The Mona Lisa is nothing when sat next to the glory of the opening line of Katy Perry’s 2016 hit Firework repeated over the entire tune of Katy Perry’s 2016 hit Firework. OK, so there are exceptions to the whole scripted-comedy-doesn’t-make-me-laugh thing. This is one of them. It’s kinda hard to find light in the times of coronavirus. Our lives have changed so much – but this dude replaced all the bottles of hand sanitiser in his workplace with lube. There’s something magical in this duet. The earnest US teenager next to the Australian ratbag in glasses that are way too small, and a life lesson we should all listen to. I will say to you now, in complete sincerity, that this video is responsible for snapping me out of multiple depressive episodes. I don’t know why Tony was trying to stand on that egg. But I do know that his attempt has brightened my life. 29 January 2016 was the day the perfect video was posted to YouTube."
"If you thought a black comedy about a toxic, mutated monster on the loose in Seoul would be a complete escape from your reality, think again. Before Parasite, Korean auteur and Oscar-winner Bong Joon-ho released his first crossover hit with 2006’s The Host. An uncommon genre in his home country, Bong has said people initially laughed when he first decided to make monster films. But in spite of the scepticism, The Host became the highest-grossing Korean film that year and a surprising American hit, garnering fans such as director Quentin Tarantino. Monsters have always been prevalent in Bong’s films – figuratively and literally. In his crime thriller Memories of Murder, police are on the hunt for a serial killer that can’t be found and in Okja, the monster is not the giant, pig-like creature at the centre of the narrative but a multi-national corporation headed by Tilda Swinton. In The Host we may have a typical monster but just like all of Bong’s films, the villain is never definitive. I knew when I pressed play on The Host it wasn’t going to be just a typical series of superficial CGI moments and one-liners. And thank god for that. Inspired by a real-life case in 2000 in which a US morgue official was convicted of dumping hazardous chemicals into the Han River in South Korea, the film’s opening scene is of an American scientist ordering his Korean subordinate to pour a large amount of formaldehyde down the lab drain. Fast forward a few years and we are introduced to our protagonists, the dysfunctional Park family, who own a little convenience stall alongside the river: patriarchal grandfather Hee-bong; his lazy, buffoon son Gang-du (played by Bong’s frequent collaborator Song Kang-ho); Gang-du’s charming daughter Hyun-seo; and her aunt and uncle, archery champion Nam-joo and failed activist turned unemployed alcoholic, Nam-il. Within minutes, the chemically mutated creature enters the screen, wreaking havoc on the river’s busy thoroughfare. The beloved Hyun-seo is swallowed by the monster and taken down into the depths of the sewerage system. The US military immediately overtakes the city – a critique on the lingering American presence in Korea – forcing a lockdown and everyone into quarantine (sound familiar?) due to the suspicion that the monster has unleashed a deadly virus. In quarantine, Gang-du receives a muffled call from Hyun-seo’s phone and the family becomes convinced she’s still alive. The authorities won’t listen, so the family breaks out, becoming fugitives as they attempt to rescue her, and that’s where the story really kicks off. Taking inspiration from Spielberg’s Jaws and M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs, Bong focuses on humanising the “loser” family rather than the otherworldly monster to elicit powerful drama and to create unlikely heroes of the flawed, complex and ultimately relatable Parks who hold the moral compass. The family is also the through line that allows Bong to tie in his not-so-subtle political views around issues such as the convenient “weapons of mass destruction” claims justifying the war in Iraq to the use of Agent Orange by US forces in the Vietnam War. Perhaps the most startling social commentary in the film is the eerily prophetic event of quarantine. From a city in lockdown being advised of flu-like symptoms, to the government grappling with an unknown “monster”, the film directly taps into our current strange existence in Covid-19 times. For me, it all culminates in one comedic scene of masked citizens waiting for a green light and an unmasked man coughing and spitting loudly, causing everyone to tense up and edge away. An ambitious film that covers a lot of ground, The Host is funny, entertaining and poignant, and the CGI holds up pretty well for a mid-2000s film. Bong may have left a few questions unanswered, but it was definitely his plan to make us reflect on our present situation through the film’s messages long after the credits roll."
"“Are you in your bed like I am?” Geena Davis asks. It is late at night and I am talking to Davis by Zoom, me in my bed in London, her in hers in Los Angeles. I tell her that I only just resisted getting into my pyjamas for this call. “Ha ha! I changed into a sweatsuit!” she says, and she is, indeed, in an all-white sweatsuit. Yet even in athleisure, she still looks like a golden-era Hollywood beauty. Davis made her movie debut in Tootsie in 1982, in which she first appeared in just her bra and knickers, to Dustin Hoffman’s memorable confusion. But it was always easy to picture her in a film from the 1940s, wearing a long satin dress, holding a martini glass and making a snappy comeback to Cary Grant. I am not sure why Davis is in bed, given that it is the middle of the afternoon in LA. But she is so warm and personable that it feels as if we are two pals, having a cosy chat before bedtime. I ask how she has been finding lockdown, which she has shared with her 18-year-old daughter and 16-year-old twin sons. “Well, I’m a bit of a homebody anyway, so I’m good at amusing myself in downtime,” she says, snuggling down into her pillows. “I’m wiping everything down with Lysol, scrubbing the bananas with detergent …” When she is not scrubbing bacteria off bananas, Davis, now 64, has been putting together this summer’s Bentonville film festival, which, inevitably, will be online. She co-founded the non-profit festival in 2015 to promote women and minorities in the film business and in this summer’s festival, more than 80% of the films were directed by women, 65% by people of colour and 40% by LGBTQ people. By comparison, people of colour accounted for 12.6% of the directors of the top 200 Hollywood films in 2017, yet they make up about 35% of the US population. Similarly, only 12% of the directors of the top 100 grossing films in the US last year were women. Does Davis really think she can change representation in Hollywood movies with her festival? “Oh, we want to change the world!” she says with a big smile. “Our goal is very simple: the storytellers and people on screen should reflect the population, which is half female and incredibly diverse. It’s not like: ‘Wow, what a far-fetched idea!’ It just makes total sense.” Davis knows better than most how difficult this will be to achieve. Conversations about who is represented on screen, and how, are now part of the public conversation, with Patricia Arquette, Mindy Kaling and Lupita Nyong’o all speaking about it in recent years. But Davis has been talking about this for two decades and, for the past 13 years, she has run the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, a research-heavy endeavour focused on improving the representation of women and girls in children’s entertainment. She launched it after watching some children’s TV with her then toddler daughter and her “jaw just dropped to the floor” when she saw how – even just in crowd scenes – there were far more male characters than female ones, and the female characters were rarely in leadership roles. “I had this realisation that this problem we’re all trying to fix, gender inequality, well, a good way would be to stop teaching two-year-olds to have a gender bias,” she says. When she talked to people in the entertainment industry about it, they would say, “Oh we fixed that,” and then cite a show with one female character. “It was the Snow White and Seven Dwarves issue,” says Davis. She spent two years with researchers, gathering data to prove she was right, and when she presented it to the children’s entertainment industry, she says they were horrified: “They were like: ‘We make kids entertainment and we never even thought about this! We need to do better.’ And that’s been the story ever since,” she says. There is no doubt that Davis’s institute has had an impact. She won an honorary Oscar last year for her work, and according to the latest research from the institute there is now gender and even race parity on the most popular children’s TV shows. Yet she concedes that it is easier dealing with film-makers for children “because they care about kids and believe the data”. With the mainstream industry, she says: “They’ve known for decades about how few women directors there are, for example, and it does nothing to make them want to do better.” Davis’s institute has proved that films with female leads do better. Yet, in 2019’s top-grossing films, women accounted for 37% of major characters and 34% of all speaking characters. Hollywood is often misogynistic, but if there is one thing the movie industry cares about more than anything it is profit. So why aren’t female leads the norm, or even the majority, if they make more money? “Well, you know, it’s a mystery to me,” says Davis. “It’s like, for years, we’ve known that companies with more women on the board make more profit. So where’s the change? Then you have to wonder, is it ennui? Is it devotion to the status quo? It’s frustrating.” Despite all the talk about this subject in recent years, especially in the wake of #MeToo, it seems unlikely things will improve soon. At the moment, no one is certain when movie-making – and movie-watching – will get back to normal. Is Davis concerned that all her gains will be washed away as Hollywood retrenches to survive? “You know, I’ve seen headlines saying we’re going to lose gains for people of colour and women, and I’m not sure why that would happen. I’ll have to read up on it,” she says with the pluckiness of one who fully believes she can change the world. Davis’s optimism is impressive given how often she has been let down by the film industry. She won an Oscar for her fantastic performance as the eccentric dog trainer Muriel in 1988’s The Accidental Tourist: “That was the most fun. It was the first time I’d been nominated and I thought ‘Well, I don’t have to wonder if I’ll ever win an Oscar – because I did!’” Yet the movie that changed everything for her, she says, was Thelma & Louise, in 1991. “Before that, I’d be recognised on the street and people would say to me ‘The Fly’ or ‘Beetlejuice’,” she says, citing two of her greatest 80s hits. “But after Thelma & Louise, everyone wanted to talk to me, telling me how the film had changed their life, how many times they’d seen it. So that changed for ever how I considered what parts to play. I would think: ‘What are the women in the audience going to say when they see this movie?’” In 1992, she was in another feminist classic, A League of Their Own, playing the housewife-slash-baseball demon, Dottie. Both movies were massive commercial hits. “Everyone said: ‘Now we’re going to have so many movies starring women.’ And I was like: ‘Hot dog! I’m in something that started change.’ And then A League of Their Own comes out and everyone says: ‘Now there’s going to be so many women’s sports movies!’ And five years go by … It was a shock that absolutely nothing happened,” she says. Davis experienced sexual harassment as an actor – a director telling her to sit on his lap at an audition, seeing other directors sexually harass people on sets, but there was a feeling, she says: “You can’t say anything, because it will kill your career.” #MeToo has changed everything: “People really can talk about it now. It’s like night and day and it’s amazing,” she says. Yet not everything has changed. Davis is one of the most successful actors of her generation, yet once she had “a four in front of my age, I fell off the cliff. I really did,” she says. “In the early stages of my career, I was blithely going along thinking, ‘Meryl Streep, Jessica Lange and Sally Field, they’re all making these great female-centric movies. And I’m getting these great roles, really tippy-top roles, so things must be getting better for women.’ But suddenly, the great roles were incredibly scarce. It was a big difference.” Davis has continued to work, if not at the same high-profile as before. She was great as the first female president in the too-shortlived 2005 TV series, Commander in Chief, and I loved her cameo appearance in Lake Bell’s terrific 2013 film about sexism in the film trailer business, In a World. Most recently, she had a running role in the Netflix series Glow, in which she made an unforgettable appearance in a full Vegas showgirl outfit, with only rhinestones keeping her just about decent. She looked incredible, but I have to ask how playing a semi-nude showgirl fits in with her argument that we need to see more high-powered women onscreen. “You mean, playing the manager of the hotel bookings,” she corrects me cheerfully, but firmly, referring to her character’s main job, and then talks at length about how it was very much her decision to wear that costume. I ask if she felt more in control wearing the showgirl outfit than she did when she wore her lingerie in Tootsie when she was just starting out. She bats the question away again. “You know, it didn’t bother me on Tootsie, either. The first day of shooting [director] Sydney Pollack said: ‘Why are you not nervous? It’s your first day on a movie set, you’re in your underwear and there’s Dustin Hoffman. I would have expected you to be nervous!’ But I think I thought: ‘This is how it’s supposed to happen. My whole life I wanted to be an actress and now I’m in a movie. So it all makes sense.’” Davis was born in Massachusetts, the second child of a teaching assistant and a civil engineer. She studied drama at Boston University and worked briefly as a model before landing her role in Tootsie. She has been married four times, including to Jeff Goldblum, with whom she starred in 80s films The Fly, Transylvania 6-5000 and Earth Girls are Easy, and later to the director Renny Harlin, with whom she made 1995’s Cutthroat Island, a rare flop on her CV. Her most recent marriage, to Reza Jarrahy, a surgeon, ended in 2017. Would she marry again? “Oh man … I don’t think so. But with my track record people might be sceptical. I keep trying to get it right,” she says. With Jarrahy, she had her daughter when she was 46 and her twins when she was 48. I tell her that I had twins when I was 38 and was shattered, so I can’t imagine how she coped at 48. “I always felt lucky that I had my kids late, because I just feel like I changed so much. I always knew I wanted kids, but what I was doing waiting that long, I don’t know. I never tried before, in other words. But it’s been great. And twins are fun!” she says. A text message comes through, and it is from one of her sons, telling her that he has ordered a takeaway. “Oh, he’s probably starving!” she gasps guiltily. “Mommy’s just busy talking about herself again.” Davis can’t remember when she first realised she was a feminist. But in the early 90s, she repeatedly described A League of Their Own to journalists as “a feminist film”. “Can we write that?” the journalists asked, shocked. “It was so insane how shame-filled [the word] was then. And then there was that whole thing with [people saying] ‘I’m not a feminist BUT …’ I hate that,” she says. She can, however, remember when she realised she wanted to be an actor. “I was three years old, and how I even knew it was a job, I have no idea, because we were only allowed to watch Disney movies, which were animated.” Has the job lived up to her expectations? “Oh, yeah!” she says with a big smile. She doesn’t feel it let her down, in the end? Her smile shrinks, then vanishes. “Oh, yeah. I do feel let down.”"
"Seth Meyers returned to Late Night on Monday with some dismal coronavirus news: it is still, in August, taking more than two weeks to receive testing results in some states, “which is insane”, he said. “The whole point of testing is to find cases, isolate them, then trace their contacts. If it takes two weeks, it’s pointless.” “We could’ve avoided this with a coordinated testing strategy from the beginning,” he continued, and the US almost had one until Jared Kushner “slithered out of his Westworld milk bath and fucked it up”. According to a damning report by Vanity Fair last week, Kushner secretly spearheaded a plan for an aggressive national testing strategy in March and April that went “poof into thin air” after it met with a “changing sentiment” by the administration. Senior advisers reportedly believed the virus was subsiding and primarily affecting “blue states”, and thus sought to push the blame for testing failures on Democratic governors. “I guess it’s not surprising to learn that Jared Kushner is a sociopath,” Meyers said. “I mean, look at him. He looks like Hannibal Lecter in a CW reboot of Silence of the Lambs. ‘Did you hear about the new kid? I heard he ate someone’s liver with fava beans and a Capri Sun.’” “Kushner is the guy who takes his gloves off before dousing you with kerosene,” Meyers added, imagining the president’s son-in-law in action: “Gasoline is such a tricky smell to get out of leather. Were you aware of that, detective?” “So they had a national testing plan then scrapped it so they could blame the whole thing on Democratic governors,” Meyers recapped. Given that it’s the Trump administration, he joked that it was likely their testing plan was simply: “1. Have one.” But “not only is that evil, it’s stupid. This is an infectious disease. This virus has traveled all over the world. Did they not realize it could travel to red states too?” Meyers tried to imagine the mindset of a Trump official: “It’s a perfect plan – as long as no one from New York ever goes to Florida.” “Well guys, with the coronavirus surging and the economy cratering,” Jimmy Fallon opened on the Tonight Show, “President Trump is turning his attention to what’s really important”: threatening to ban the Chinese-owned app TikTok in the US, citing a vague national security threat. “What is he doing? Is he the president of the United States or the preacher from Footloose?” Fallon joked. “Apparently this is a real national security threat: the Chinese government knowing which Americans can and can’t dance,” Fallon added. “I’m sure it has everything to do with national security and nothing to do with the TikTok teens who sabotaged his Tulsa rally.” Or it could be that Trump is “playing hardball with China”, Fallon riffed, since “if he bans TikTok, China will only be able to spy on our phones, TVs, cars and refrigerators. So, that’s where he draws the line.” As for reports that Microsoft will purchase the app, Fallon found the idea of the American tech giant owning the video-loop app laughable. “The most non-TikTok-y people are buying TikTok,” he said. “It’s a big day for the three TikTok fans that also love Excel spreadsheets.”"
"We all know that face masks are a good thing, but why? Is it because they are a useful tool in slowing the spread of Covid-19? Well, yes. But more than that, it’s because we now have the opportunity to cover our nose and mouth with sweet, sweet, officially licensed merchandise. Until now, whenever we wanted to demonstrate our love of the arts, we have had to rely on clothing or – worse – actual verbal interaction. Now, when you wander into Tesco Express wearing a mask, everyone from the checkout assistant to the guys operating the CCTV will understand that you’re the world’s biggest Twilight fan. Here are some of the best and worst on offer … Never let it be said that Disney is not quick off the mark when there’s a buck to be made. At time of writing, the UK Disney store had no less than 24 different face mask designs for sale, ranging from “cleverly designed” (Mickey Mouse’s mouth, the Incredible Hulk’s mouth) to “this honestly looks like we just chopped up a load of pyjamas in a panic”. Nevertheless, what a golden opportunity to show the world that you have an affinity for an oppressive cultural monopoly. Meanwhile, here is arguably the world’s least imaginative face covering. Not only does it exist to promote a single – Stuck With U by Bieber and Ariana Grande – that came out two-and-a-half months ago and barely scraped into the Top 5, but it is also hopelessly designed. This looks less like a piece of official merchandise and more a primary school PE plimsoll that your mum has written your name on with a knitting needle dipped in bleach. If you’re going to wear a band mask, you should at least make sure that some of the band’s lyrics are visible, to better communicate your taste in music to the strangers you pass. A classic example is this Rammstein mask, which comes daubed with the legend “WER WARTET MIT BESONNENHEIT – DER WIRD BELOHNT ZUR RECHTEN ZEIT” from their 2009 song Rammlied. What does it mean? “The one who waits with prudence will be rewarded at the right time.” If ever there was a motto for post-lockdown life, it should be one that comes screamed by a load of fiftysomething German metallers. And then there’s this. If you are aware of Dario Argento, you will be familiar with the classic 1977 “The only thing more terrifying than the last 12 minutes of this film are the first 92” poster, featuring a closeup of a screaming face. But if you aren’t, you will just see someone strolling around town with their face contorted into a howl of psychic agony. It’s 2020 for crying out loud. That’s what our faces already look like. Perhaps we should look outside of official merchandise. Society6 has always been full of artistic interpretations of cult film and TV, but now it has inevitably made the leap to face masks. This Twin Peaks one does the job perfectly. If you love Twin Peaks, you’ll see the iconic Red Room chevron design and realise that you’re in the company of a fellow David Lynch aficionado. If you don’t, you’ll just see a neat design. This is the mask that all other masks should aspire to. The face mask market is so new that copyright seems to have gone out of the window. Type the name of any film, song, TV show or actor into a site such as Etsy or Redbubble and you’ll be swamped by all manner of unofficial face coverings. If you want one that says “We were on a break” in the Friends font, you’re in luck. If you want one that makes you look like Kevin McCallister from Home Alone trapped in a perpetual shriek, you’re in luck. And if you want one of Nicolas Cage you’re doubly in luck: there’s one covered in dozens of photos of his face, all bulging eyes and bared teeth, and another with his mug stretched across skin-shaded fabric. Both are such nightmarish flesh collages that everyone you encounter is guaranteed to flee from you in terror, but that’s what social distancing is all about."
"Ushers, stage hands, dressers and those who work on the stage door of the nation’s empty theatres are struggling to survive during lockdown, with some even contemplating suicide according to the industry charity, The Theatrical Guild. Now Sir Ian McKellen, the renowned stage and screen star, has helped to launch an emergency fund to support them . The actor, famous for playing Gandalf in Peter Jackson’s Tolkien films, has kicked off the fundraising drive with a donation of £40,000 of the money raised from his recent 80th birthday tour of British theatres. “Many people who work in the theatre industry have seen their livelihoods disappear due to the coronavirus lockdown,” said McKellen. “I, for example, have received a distressing letter from a stage manager who is facing eviction from his home and can’t access government relief.” The actor, who has recently announced a plan to play Hamlet again, 50 years after the last time, and who is now attending virtual rehearsals for the role, added that the emergency fund scheme is “a wonderful opportunity”.  The guild was set up 125 years ago to support those who, with their varied sets of skills, are the unsung heroes of staged performances. Most are low-paid, self-employed or on zero hours contracts and as a result many have fallen through the safety nets put up by the government to protect those who lost work during the pandemic. Actors Eddie Redmayne and Prasanna Puwanarajah are also backing the new fundraising effort because of the evidence of serious need in the front-of-house and backstage community, which includes costumiers, wig makers, props assistants, scene painters, lighting and sound operators, box office and bar staff as well as cleaners. The privations of lockdown have meant many have been unable to pay their rent and several have considered suicide, Adam Bambrough, the guild’s general manager told The Observer. “These people are a huge part of every single theatrical building in the country and they are the public face of many theatres. As well being mainly freelancers, those with jobs have been hit heavily by the swathe of redundancies happening in theatres,” said Bambrough. “Sadly I have heard from nine or 10 people who have been contemplating taking their own lives in the last few weeks. Many others are struggling to find the money for food and rent.” The emergency appeal is aimed at helping with food bills, housing costs, mental health services and other basic essentials. The guild cites the example of one stage manager, Maria, who lost her room in theatre digs overnight when her production shutdown. The guild has given her money for temporary accommodation."

"I grew up in Witton Gilbert in County Durham and started Prefab Sprout with my brother [Martin, bass] and Michael Salmon, who lived down the street. Michael borrowed a drum kit and Martin and I shared an amplifier. We rehearsed in my dad’s run-down wooden-framed petrol station. We were as rough as can be, but we sounded like a band, at least to ourselves. I didn’t have music lessons but I was drawn to music that I read about and devoured everything from T Rex to Stravinsky. It’s almost embarrassing now, but I dreamed about influencing the course of pop. I’d been writing songs since I was 13, but after David Bowie’s Station to Station came out, when I was 19, I started to study his methods, likes and dislikes. He didn’t like country and western, so I wrote Faron Young from the worldview of someone who disliked country music. Bonny was written around the same time. People think it’s about my father’s death, but he wasn’t dead then – I imagined grief. Goodbye Lucille #1 started out as a 50s doo-wop parody – “Ooh, Johnny Johnny Johnny” – in waltz time, but turned into something serious. Most breakup songs were sad or accusatory, but I straddled the viewpoints of both the intense guy and the girl breaking up with him (“She’s a person too”). I’d always written on an acoustic guitar, but just as we started making records I had a crisis and thought I’d exhausted the guitar and started writing instead on a Roland synthesiser. I was too eccentric or nervous a songwriter to incorporate a big chorus, but when When Love Breaks Down came along I didn’t fight it. I wrote that, and Appetite – over a hip-hop-type groove on a drum machine – and then Desire As in the same week in June 1984. “I’ve got six things on my mind. You’re no longer one of them” is so cold. I wouldn’t want to say that to anybody. “Desire as a sylph-figured creature who changes her mind.” I’ve no idea where these things come from. I’d used my most off-kilter ideas on our first album, Swoon, and I’d deliberately held back my more commercial songs. The album title – Steve McQueen – came to me in a dream. It doesn’t mean anything, but I decided to use it and we shot the cover using a motorbike like the one McQueen had in The Great Escape. The album went gold and has sold steadily ever since. I’m humbled that it’s become a classic and people still discover it, but I still remember driving away from the studio in the snow thinking we’d get a lot of praise for something I felt I didn’t have much to do with. It was us playing the songs in the studio – Thomas Dolby and the team did a marvellous job of making us sound grand and opulent. When we were doing Johnny Johnny there was this embarrassing clunk, which was the sound of me hitting the microphone stand while singing. Thomas loved the take and wanted to keep it, so he went to the Fairlight sampler, looked at the wave form of the sound and just took out the clunk. I remember thinking, “Wow, so that’s what pop is going to be like in future.” I was on Radio 1’s Roundtable programme reviewing records, and the other guests were raving about all these awful Christmas songs. Then Prefab Sprout’s Don’t Sing came on. I’d never heard anything like it. Paddy’s ideas seemed detached from everything except maybe a mid-20th-century American novel. The next thing I knew their manager invited me up to their old rectory in Consett. Paddy’s bedroom was twice the size of a single mattress. He sat with a guitar and played me songs from sheets of paper. I recorded them all, took them home and whittled 40 down to 12. There was fantastic flair and imagination but the arrangements were hard to listen to, so we restructured the songs in a rehearsal room right down to the exact placement of a crash cymbal – Neil Conti was a tasty drummer. We recorded in a big London studio over three months, which today would only be an option for a platinum-selling band. Paddy’s voice was warm and emotive, Wendy [Smith]’s was pure and pristine – they created a nice aura. I played Paddy’s chords on my synthesiser using my own sounds. The Fairlight sampler had just come out so I could make orchestral arrangements. The gunshot on Faron Young came from a BBC sound effects disc played backwards. I did things like sampling Wendy’s voice and “playing” it on a few songs. I’ve never seen a band eat like Prefab. Wendy would say “Paddy, do you want a bacon sandwich?” and they’d all go off for a fry-up. We recorded Horsin’ Around after a pub break. Paddy launched into a swing version à la Frank Sinatra. I laughed my head off, and thought it might make an interesting style for the middle section, so we kept it."
"After criticizing John Bolton last week for holding his criticism of the Trump administration for a lucrative book deal, Stephen Colbert hammered Trump’s former national security adviser in an interview on Tuesday’s Late Show. Bolton’s book The Room Where it Happened, which the Trump administration has unsuccessfully attempted to block from publication, contains a number of revelations about Trump’s fascination with autocrats that are “shocking” but “really shouldn’t be shocking because they’re so true to form for Donald Trump,” Colbert said. Colbert wondered why Bolton, a war hawk who has served in numerous Republican administrations, would work for Trump. “You didn’t have to go into government and you didn’t have to go into the Trump administration,” he said. “Why did you go in knowing how chaotic it was? Did you think that chaos was a ladder that you could climb?” Bolton answered that he “certainly heard all the stories” but spoke with Trump before he took office and “entered aware of the problems but optimistic that they could be overcome”. Asked by Colbert about what long-time Republicans in government are saying behind closed doors, Bolton said that “in fairness to Trump,” many conservatives see the comparison with Joe Biden, “as I did in 2016 with Hillary Clinton,” and say, “whatever we think of him, he’s not going to be a Democrat subject, especially these days, to the pressure of the left.” Colbert laughed at the “pressure from the left” idea and interjected: “No, he’s going to be subject to the pressure of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping! “He’s a person who’s going to sell out the interests of the American people for his own re-election. What could be worse in Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden’s philosophy than betraying your own country to a hostile foreign leader, sir?” “Trust me, I understand that point,” Bolton stuttered before Colbert shot back: “But will you answer that question?” Bolton explained that his view of Trump in 2016 was “we at least have to try it out” – which is why he voted for him. But “having experienced 17 months of working with him, I can’t in good conscience do that again.” Bolton again confirmed, as he has previously, that he would not vote for either Trump or Biden in November. “I guess what’s exasperating is there is absolutely nothing that Donald Trump has done that is surprising to me,” Colbert responded. “My rule is, everything you think about Donald Trump is probably true. Because he’s not deep enough to get your socks wet in. He’s incredibly readable,” which is why when he ran casinos, “the house lost” – a comment which drew a laugh from Bolton. But Bolton’s smile darkened as Colbert continued: “There’s nothing to learn about him. He’s essentially a boring person. How did you not know beforehand that he was just callow?” “Because I couldn’t believe it was that bad,” Bolton replied. “And I know other people say they saw it from the beginning – ” Colbert cut him off, laughing again, and asked: “But you’re an international negotiator, how could you be naive? You’ve dealt with the worst people in the world.” “You’ve really insulted me now by calling me naive,” Bolton replied. “I thought it was possible to work with somebody,” he said of Trump, because “surely they would want to learn about the complexities of arms control negotiations and that sort of thing. As I detail in the book, that turned out not to be true.” And on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah investigated systemic under-representation of black people in corporate America despite a flurry of Black Lives Matter solidarity tweets and posts from companies who clearly have some internal work to do. Nike, for example, ran an ad proclaiming, “Don’t pretend there’s not a problem in America,” though all of the company’s executives are white. “If you are just some random person who has like ten followers on Twitter and you tweet Black Lives Matter, maybe that’s the best you can do,” said Noah. “But if you’re a major corporation that hires thousands of people, you can actually show that black lives matter in a material way that goes beyond your social media feed.” Noah thus investigated actual avenues for corporate accountability for anti-racism in a new segment called “\This Black American Life. “Despite what your racist uncle says on Facebook, for many black Americans, getting a job is almost impossible,” Noah explained, starting with getting one’s foot in the door; as Pascal Desroches, chief financial officer at WarnerMedia, told CNN, white Americans are hired on potential while black Americans are hired on demonstrated accomplishment. “That’s the thing I wish more people understood,” said Noah. “Black people are looking for equality, not charity. They’re not asking people to ‘hire black people’ just because they’re black, they’re asking companies to stop not hiring black people just because they’re black.” If black employees do get a foot in the door, Noah continued, climbing the ladder is difficult – only 3.2% of corporate executives in America are black – and one’s challenges are compounded by micro-aggressions such as “you’re very articulate,” “you’re not like the others,” and hair-grabbing. Such thoughtlessness is “what you get from living in a segregated society,” said Noah. “Instead of knowing black people and black culture, you’ve got white folks interacting with black people like they’re making contact with ET.” Noah ended with a message to corporate America: “If you really believe in rooting out systemic racism and supporting black lives, then I say to you: examine your own actions within your companies before history leaves you behind. Or as I would put it if I wasn’t in the office: you better check yourself before you wreck yourself.”"

"Failures has a very Joy Division title, but the sound is sub-Raw Power-era Stooges. Meanwhile, the fact that Ian Curtis sounds about 13 years old underlines the slightly amateur air. With the best will in the world, you would have needed powers of clairvoyance to work out that its authors would turn out to be epochal. Unavailable for a decade after Ian Curtis’s suicide, Joy Division’s debut EP An Ideal for Living developed a mythic aura that its contents don’t warrant. Warsaw sounds like the band they were – a primitive Mancunian response to punk – rather than the band they would become. Better remembered for Bernard Sumner’s ill-advised opening shout of “You all forgot Rudolph Hess” than the song itself, Joy Division’s contribution to the Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus compilation has a certain power – the band had taken the stage shortly after a fight with members of the Drones – but it’s not a great song: note Curtis’s raw, unformed vocals. Also from An Ideal for Living, No Love Lost took inspiration from a novella about brothels in Nazi concentration camps that also give Joy Division their name: it’s got a certain dark, schlocky power, but little spark. The solitary track on An Ideal for Living that points towards the future, Leaders of Men is not a great song – you can hear a faint echo of Bowie’s Queen Bitch in its bridge – but the echoing drums and jagged guitar presage the sound Joy Division would subsequently pursue. As with a number of outtakes posthumously released on the compilation Still, you can see why Joy Division abandoned Something Must Break. Recorded at the same session as Transmission, it is off-key and strangely tinny, features a reedy garage rock organ, and is notable mainly for Stephen Morris’s hyperactive drumming. In May 1978, Joy Division recorded an album’s worth of material, ostensibly for RCA. Most of it was subsequently re-recorded, save for The Drawback, and you can see why: its stop-start punkiness feels lightweight and indebted to Buzzcocks. The weaker of the two songs Joy Division contributed to A Factory Sample, Glass feels transitional. The ghost of punk is still lurking, with a Rotten-ish keen to Curtis’s vocals, and Martin Hannett’s production adds a weird sense of space to the sound, but it’s one of their less memorable songs. Another Unknown Pleasures outtake that turned up on Still, Walked in Line has a very Transmission-esque guitar solo and heavily compressed Hannett production but still sounds unfinished, with something distinctly tentative about Curtis’s vocal. Perhaps they abandoned it on account of the lyrics: a depiction of goose-stepping soldiers ambiguous enough to cause trouble. Released on a flexidisc alongside Komakino, the influence of Kraftwerk’s Trans-Europe Express hangs heavy over this electronic instrumental. Essentially improvised synthesizer over a rhythm track, it is interesting rather than essential. You can see how Incubation worked as a powerful set-opening instrumental onstage, its role during Joy Division gigs in 1980, but the studio version reveals it as basically a Transmission redux – similar bassline and guitar – albeit with stompier, glam-inspired drums. Proof that Joy Division never entirely left their roots behind: at the same session that produced the peerless Atmosphere, they recorded Ice Age, which would have sounded like a straightforward punky thrash were it not for the bizarre drum track, which lends an unsettling off-kilter feel. A good-quality leftover from their debut album that eventually turned up on Still, The Kill suggests the version of Unknown Pleasures that Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner initially said they would have rather released: more visceral and punky than producer Hannett’s futuristic vision. As harrowing and oppressive as anything off Closer, The Sound of Music was debuted on a 1979 John Peel session then recorded again during the sessions for the Love Will Tear Us Apart single. It is tough going – the lyrics are utterly hopeless; the voice singing them sounds authentically desperate – but as a portrait of a mind at the end of its tether, it is horribly compelling. In one of the weirder twists in their career, Joy Division once attempted to record a cover of NF Porter’s northern soul stomper Keep On Keepin’ On. They eventually reworked it into Interzone, but there is a distinct northern backbeat to Novelty, too. Tucked away on the B-side of Transmission, it also boasted one of the band’s sweetest melodies. On which Joy Division improbably transform the aforementioned soul stomper Keep On Keepin’ On into a ragged homage to William Burroughs, sung by Peter Hook, with Curtis providing impenetrable backing vocals. The flipside of Love Will Tear Us Apart in every sense, These Days reflects on a collapsing relationship not with sorrow, but cynicism and anger (“Took threats and abuse until I learnt the part”). It tempers its poppy lushness with starker, harder music, although the burbling synth that runs throughout seems to prefigure New Order’s later direction. Remarkably sparse – its bass and drums intermittently streaked with densely effected guitar – From Safety to Where …? has a lyric that could be about smalltown claustrophobia, or Joy Division’s decision to step beyond the increasingly codified confines of punk: “Just passing through until we reach the next stage / Should we move on or stay safely away?” You get the feeling Exercise One might have been intended as an atmospheric opening track for Unknown Pleasures before being usurped by the more direct Disorder. Either way, it still sounds amazing: a brooding storm of guitar noise and thumping drums with Curtis’s voice distant and swathed in cavernous echo. Arguably the best of the previously unreleased songs on Still, it seems faintly surprising that Joy Division chose to leave The Only Mistake off Unknown Pleasures. It would have fitted perfectly: the sound of Curtis’s vocal fighting for space with its sheets of guitar noise – and occasionally losing – is potent, and fits with the lyrical depiction of suffocating relationship woe. You can hear the influence of Pere Ubu’s Sentimental Journey – with its smashed crockery sound effects – on the final track of Unknown Pleasures. It is a bold choice of closer: no melody, the song barely there at all, and everything resting on Curtis’s pained vocal delivery and the obliquely disturbing imagery. Blessed with an oddly funky riff, Komakino feels distinctly like a relative of Closer’s opening track Atrocity Exhibition, in both its title – which translates as “coma cinema” – and the intense, thundering rhythm of Morris’s drums. The lyrics, meanwhile, cover similar emotional territory to that found on Closer: “How can I find the right way to control all the conflicts inside, all the problems beside?” Finally released in 2011, Joy Division’s rough rehearsal version of a song subsequently recorded by New Order is, as Peter Hook noted, “too much”. The muffled sound heightens the mood of oppressive darkness until it is intolerable, and the final verse – which literally depicts a hanging – suggests that however tempting it is to envisage a different, happier outcome to Joy Division’s story, it was never on the cards. It is the mark of what a great album Unknown Pleasures is that even its lesser tracks sound spectacular, Wilderness among them. It takes a simple garage rock riff into an entirely unexpected space – enveloped by cavernous echo – and ends by ratcheting up the emotional temperature, repeating the line “they had tears in their eyes” with a mounting sense of alarm. Inspired by Franz Kafka’s short story In the Penal Colony – about a machine that tortures and executes condemned men, but grants them a religious epiphany in the process – Colony’s music takes a Stooges-esque riff and disrupts it with an unsettlingly jerky stop-start rhythm. Sonically Closer’s starkest track, Passover stares unflinchingly at the chaos of Curtis’s personal life – his marriage, “brutally taking its time” to collapse completely, his relationship with girlfriend Annik Honoré – and the impact on his mental health: “Doubting, unsettling and turning around … disturbing and purging my mind.” Evidence that the huge artistic leap that occurred between Joy Division’s contributions to A Factory Sample and Unknown Pleasures was not solely down to producer Hannett’s idiosyncratic vision: they simply hadn’t recorded material as majestic and controlled as Day of the Lords before. Some albums’ opening tracks lure you gently in: Closer’s smacks the listener in the face. Six minutes of twisted guitar noise, hypnotic bass and thundering drums, Atrocity Exhibition’s melody, such as it is, is entirely carried by the vocals, forcing your attention on the frankly horrifying lyrics: bedlam, genocide, the violence of the Colosseum. “Joy Division sounded like ghosts,” offered Manchester writer Bob Dickinson in Jon Savage’s oral history This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else. Never more so than on Unknown Pleasures outtake Autosuggestion, six minutes of backwards guitar, echoing drums and a vocal reliant on long, mournful notes that slowly reaches a frenetic climax, topped by Curtis’s repeated invocation: “Lose some sleep and say you tried.” A perfect example of post-punk’s subversion of disco’s relentless four-to-the-floor beat – Joy Division’s manager Rob Gretton was apparently a great collector of US dance singles – A Means to an End’s lyrics seem to conflate Curtis’s personal situation with warfare, a subject he returned to again and again, as topic and metaphor. The syndrum – the perky “bing-boo” noise voguish on disco records circa 1979 – was an unlikely addition to Joy Division’s sonic arsenal, but it works to striking effect on Insight. Bizarrely, it sounds as desolate during the verses as Curtis’s melancholy croon of “I remember when we were young”; elsewhere, it was manipulated until it sounded, in Morris’s memorable phrase, “like a flock of marauding pigeons”. A mammoth leap forward from the Ideal for Living EP, Digital is the sound of Joy Division carving out their own unique space in the post-punk landscape: clipped and hypnotic, driven by Hook’s bass – the guitar colouring rather than driving the song – it keeps building to a series of stark, intense climaxes, during which the emotional mood shifts from claustrophobic to distressed A last burst of nervous energy before the dark, enveloping calm of Closer’s final two tracks, Twenty Four Hours features Curtis’s voice floating over a ferocious double-time rhythm that keeps collapsing, as if it can’t carry the weight of the emotional desolation in the lyrics: “Look beyond the day in hand, there’s nothing there at all.” A bold masterpiece of understatement, Heart and Soul’s cloudy sound – mists of electronics, a vocal swathed in echo, a listlessly strummed guitar – refuses to build to any kind of climax: it just drifts along, atmospheric and ghostly. If you want to make a claim for Joy Division’s influence on goth, this is the place to start. Joy Division were famously put through the wringer by producer Hannett during the making of Unknown Pleasures, but the results were startling, as evidenced by the becalmed but unsettling atmosphere he created on Candidate – the guitar chaotic and feedback-heavy, but low in the mix – that only serves to heighten the lyrical anxiety. Slower and darker in tone than New Order’s re-recording, Joy Division’s version of Ceremony is still lighter and poppier than anything on Closer, although such things are obviously relative. Nevertheless, you can hear the makings of an epic single that might have followed Love Will Tear Us Apart in breaking the band to a wider audience. There is an oft-repeated line that Joy Division sounded like the decaying environment of late 70s Manchester. You can hear it on the superb opening track of Unknown Pleasures, its taut rhythm and streaks of electronic noise conjuring, as writer Savage put it, “endless sodium lights and hidden semis seen from a speeding car, vacant industrial sites”. On Unknown Pleasures, synthesizers ornamented Joy Division’s sound: on Closer, they started to become their sound. The chaotic live versions of Isolation and Decades included on Still showed the drawbacks to this approach, but the studio take is fantastic: a brutal machine-like beat, an icy hook, Curtis’s voice drenched in queasy effects. New Dawn Fades is among the greatest songs on Unknown Pleasures. Its thrilling surges of power – guitar slashing, Curtis’s voice becoming harder and more impassioned – carry a disturbing lyric: “A loaded gun won’t set you free,” he sings. “So you say.” Covered by Moby, it improbably turned up on the soundtrack to the 1995 Robert de Niro film Heat. Decades appears to conclude Closer on a note of calm: it glides along, richly melodic, thick with synthesizer. The lyrics, however, offer a distressing depiction of soldiers suffering from what would now be called PTSD: “We knocked on the doors of hell’s darker chamber / Pushed to the limit we dragged ourselves in.” Shadowplay was the song Joy Division chose to play on their first TV appearance in 1978. You can see why. Its murky atmosphere, its vision of a car journey not as a means of escape, but an alienating experience, underscored presenter Tony Wilson’s assessment: “Joy Division is the most interesting new sound we’ve come across.” Robert Smith’s favourite Joy Division song (its cloudy, synth and piano-led sound was clearly an influence on the Cure’s album Faith), The Eternal was inspired by a child with Down’s syndrome who lived near Curtis in Macclesfield. Both beautiful and deeply moving, it depicts his struggle to communicate with remarkable empathy. Opinion is divided as to whether the definitive version of She’s Lost Control lurks on Unknown Pleasures or the subsequent 12-inch single: either way, its shattering lyrical depiction of a woman in the throes of an epileptic seizure, its electronic rhythm and its unremitting bassline, are a spectacular achievement, the work of a rock band who sounded like no one else. “A duel of personalities that stretch all true realities, it seemed like he was two people,” noted Bono after meeting Curtis, an incisive depiction of his fractured character. Dead Souls is almost unbearably intense, its Stooges-y riff churning away behind an increasingly desperate-sounding vocal. Essential, difficult listening. Transmission has almost nothing to it – two chords, a three-note bassline, an icy synth drone – but the sheer power it builds up over the course of four minutes is extraordinary: a mounting wave of tension that is finally broken with Curtis’s anguished yell of “and we can dance!” The writer Paul Morley recalled his reaction to hearing Love Will Tear Us Apart live as one of shock: “Oh my God, this is a fucking great pop song.” But its unique power comes from the fact that it was pop warped to Joy Division’s specifications rather than vice-versa. Its catchiness concealed a strikingly blunt, agonising, inconsolable depiction of a crumbling marriage. It seems bizarre that Joy Division initially gave their greatest song away to what Curtis called “a French limited-edition magazine-cum-record thing”: Sordide Sentimental, that released only 1,578 copies of it. But then, incredible songs were coming in profusion to Joy Division at the time: Atmosphere marked the start of a remarkable burst of creativity that no one – except possibly their lead singer – realised would be their last. It is stately, emotive and epic. Moreover, there is an airiness to its beauty and a faint hint of optimism in its lyrics, both noticeably absent from their other later songs: a last, gorgeous flicker of light, before the darkness irrevocably descended."
"In the summer of 1518, in the French city of Strasbourg, a woman walked into the street and began to dance unstoppably, for days on end. Within a week, dozens more had been overcome by the same compulsion. Within a month, some of the hundreds who found themselves imprisoned by this irresistible urge to dance had danced themselves to death. In 2020, another lone dancer begins to move, standing in the corner of a darkened room. Others join her, each in their own confined space in different countries around the world, locked in repetitive patterns of exhaustion, in movement that is both defiant and despairing. At points they collapse, but rise to dance once more. Strasbourg 1518 is a 10-minute film by Jonathan Glazer, best known for feature films such as Sexy Beast, Birth and Under the Skin, and for visionary videos for bands such as Radiohead. “What caught my attention was the people of Strasbourg, 500 years ago, dancing in despair,” he says, “and the connection between them and Pina Bausch saying, centuries later, ‘dance, dance or we are lost’.” This all came back to mind as Covid-19 swept the globe. For some time, the director had been talking about creating a piece of work with the art commissioner Artangel, the organisation behind a multitude of era-defining art projects from Rachel Whiteread’s House to Steve McQueen’s Year 3, about creating a piece of work; when the feature film he was working on was postponed because of the pandemic, he and Artangel’s co-director Michael Morris discussed making something inspired by the Strasbourg story. The result, created in a record 13 weeks from first conversation to its broadcast by BBC Films, is a response to one moment in time, inspired by another. “The appeal of the story is that it rhymes with our own times,” says Morris. “Our own lockdown, our own epidemic, our own confinement and fear of catching something. There’s a timeless quality about the film. We wanted the viewer to feel the dance has been going on for centuries and it continues after the viewer finishes watching it. There’s a continuum through time. It’s not exactly set in the present, or in the past. It’s ambiguous.” Strasbourg’s “dancing plague” is in itself an extraordinarily ambiguous and mysterious event. “In terms of strangeness and of understanding the extremes the brain can take us to, it is one of the oddest events I have ever heard of,” says John Waller, associate professor of history at Michigan State University and author of A Time to Dance, A Time to Die, a book on the subject. Waller says facts on the contagion, which swept through Strasbourg over the month of July, are elusive. Chronicles suggest that “many people died”, and one report puts that at 15 deaths a day. The most detailed accounts come from the minutes of the town council, as the city elders attempted to contain the dancing. At first they consulted physicians who suggested that the best course of action was to let the sufferers get rid of their “overheated blood” by dancing more. So they built a stage in the market place and provided musicians to urge the dancers on. Eyewitnesses reported “the dancers’ frantic movements created the impression of people attempting to keep their legs and feet from burning, as if they were poised above a fire”. When dancers continued to die, the burghers tried another strategy, confining them to their homes, while simultaneously attempting to purge the city of sin – banning prostitutes, chronic gamblers and habitual drunkards. When even that didn’t work, they arranged for the dancers to be tied to carts and taken to the shrine of Saint Vitus, the patron saint of dance. There they had their feet put into red shoes – a fact that Hans Christian Andersen used when he wrote a story about a girl cursed to dance herself to death – and were blessed with holy oil and water before being walked around the shrine. After that they appeared to recover, and the outbreak died out. Waller believes that the entire affair was a case of mass psychogenic illness, where people who were convinced they had been cursed by Saint Vitus fell into dissociative states, a kind of trance of possession. They were susceptible to this because of the extreme distress of their lives and oppressive, unsettled social conditions. “This is a period where you have a series of terrible harvests and grain prices are at a generational high,” he says. “You also have a fear of the new disease of syphilis, as well as of the plague, and something called the English sweat, which no one really knows what it was.” All of which makes the Strasbourg story a rich jumping-off point for Glazer’s film. It’s not about the “dancing plague” any more than it is about the Covid-19 pandemic, but both provide a backdrop for something more allusive and haunting, powered by an insistent, eerie score by Glazer’s regular collaborator Mica Levi. Appropriately, given its inspiration, the majority of the dancers are drawn from Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, which Morris and Glazer have visited together down the years. They are direct inheritors of Bausch’s belief that it’s not how dancers move, but what moves them that matters. “Their training with Pina was that they just gave and gave,” says Morris. “You feel that in the film.” Others, recruited with the help and advice of Sadler’s Wells, include Botis Seva, the British choreographer, and Germaine Acogny, the pioneering dance-maker from Senegal. The meetings between the collaborators were organised on Zoom. “All I really did was talk through the idea with them, then send Mica’s music,” Glazer explains. “And [said] if they liked the combination, to think about what they wanted to express, from their rooms basically. A few days later they showed us a run-through and we went from there.” He was bowled over by the results. “I felt privileged to see what they were producing. Each dance was like a monologue,” he says. The final filming took place via iPhones at three points of the day and night; then Glazer set to work in the editing suite. For cinematographer Darius Khondji it has been “a once in a lifetime” experience. “It was like creating a creature of dance and imagination,” he says. “When I watch it now, it is one piece, one dancer. It was like a living sculpture we were creating every day.” "
"Two of Birmingham’s most important venues, the Symphony Hall and Town Hall, have become the latest arts institutions to announce major staff cuts because of the Covid-19 crisis. The charity that runs the two halls expressed sorrow at the prospect of losing around half of its 65 permanent staff but said that reducing its workforce was necessary for the venues to have a chance of survival. Hundreds of freelancers who work on the shows and concerts staged at the two venues are also out of work. The venues have called for clarity on when they may be able to reopen and the government’s rescue package. Opened in 1834, the Town Hall has hosted political and public meetings and performances by Charles Dickens, the Beatles and Led Zeppelin while the Symphony Hall is considered one of the best in the world and is home to the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. In a statement released on Tuesday, the venues said: “It is with great sadness that Town Hall and Symphony Hall have entered a period of redundancy consultation. “The future of these two iconic concert halls looks very different from the plans we began the year with. This period of closure has already resulted in huge losses and it is still unclear when it may be possible to reopen.” More than 90% of the halls’ turnover comes from ticket sales and other activities. Some of the money it makes from presenting international stars on its stages is ploughed into emerging local talent and working with schoolchildren in some of the UK’s most deprived areas. Nick Reed, chief executive for the Town Hall and Symphony Hall, told the Guardian that both venues were a huge source of civic pride. The opening of the Symphony Hall in 1991 is seen as a crucial moment in the modern renaissance of Birmingham. “And there’s a straight line connecting Paul Robeson [the singer, actor and activist] appearing at Town Hall in 1949 to us taking grime artists out of clubs and putting them on the same stage,” said Reed. The venues say they desperately need guidance from the government on when they may be able to reopen – and the funding to reach that point. Other Birmingham arts institutions backed the call for clarity. Birmingham Repertory theatre, which is facing the loss of 40% of its staff – up to 47 positions – said it could not plan until the government told it how the £1.57bn it has promised for the arts and heritage sector would be divided up and distributed. Rachael Thomas, the executive director of Birmingham Rep, said: “We are mindful the money has to go a long way and cover the whole of the culture sector. We need clarity about the funds and clarity about reopening.” Thomas told the Guardian she feared that the theatre would not reopen until next spring. She said the loss of culture in the city was having an impact. “If you believe, as I do, that culture is a necessary part of civic life, the loss has all sorts of impacts on individual and civic wellbeing.” Fiona Allan, chief executive of Birmingham Hippodrome and president of UK Theatre, said: “We have no news at all about reopening dates and so everyone has to make drastic decisions about staffing. My fear is that people we’re losing are not going to work in this sector any more. They are saying goodbye to theatre. There are 290,000 people employed across theatre in the UK. We reckon 70% of those jobs are at some sort of risk.”"
"Edinburgh festival fringe is preparing for a “weird” visitor-free summer with a package of online initiatives including variety shows streamed every Friday. The world’s largest arts festival would usually be gearing up for an influx of 250,000 visitors to see nearly 4,000 shows spanning comedy, cabaret, theatre, circus, music and dance. Instead the 2020 edition of the fringe, along with the city’s other festivals, was cancelled in April. Hopes that lockdown rules might be eased in time for some live performance in August appeared to be dashed last week by the latest announcements from the Scottish government. Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, said there were no preparations for live performances. “Our concentration has been completely in the digital sphere. We were never going to do anything which was not aligned to advice from the Scottish government.” The plans announced on Monday include:  Fringe on a Friday, a 60-minute independently curated variety show that will be ticketed and streamed, presenting the best of the festival across a range of genres.  A FringeMakers crowdfunding campaign to help artists and venues raise funds for themselves by offering their own content and merchandise.  Fringe Pick ’n’ Mix, where performers will be able to upload 60-second films of themselves in action. Viewers can choose the snippets they want to watch or see them randomly.  Virtual Fringe Central, an online hub including panel discussions, workshops and network sessions. The society said it would help people navigate the many streamed performances planned by the festival’s independent venues. It has also released fringe merchandise and revealed the artwork for a 2020 programme that never was. McCarthy said it would be hard to imagine the city without the fringe. “I’m dreading walking up the Royal Mile but I plan to do it. I’m also planning to find some garden or park to bring our team together on what would have been the first day of the festival. “It is genuinely going to be just so weird for all of us this year, we owe ourselves a moment to come together and acknowledge the weirdness of it.” The Fringe Society is a charity that receives almost all its money from registration and ticket sale commissions. “Once you take that away we are left as an organisation which is potentially insolvent,” McCarthy said. It is hanging on via loans and grants, principally a £1m interest-free loan from the Scottish government. “We’ve survived for the next year and all our efforts are going to be on using the resources that we have to make sure the companies and the artists and the venues can survive as well.”"
"How many Black friends do you have? Can you name five Asian people? Did your ancestors own slaves? If you don’t have the answers to these questions, you might find a new live show by Ziwe Fumudoh, who goes by the stage name Ziwe, incredibly uncomfortable. Then again, discomfort is the raison d’être of the show, which sees Ziwe grill her guests over 30 intense minutes on Instagram live, asking them awkward, difficult and sometimes seemingly impossible questions on race and sexism. Her guests have included many a liberal white woman whom the internet loves to hate, such as the food columnist Alison Roman, the influencer Caroline Calloway and the actor Rose McGowan. But her guests recently have also included Jeremy O Harris, who wrote Slave Play, and the comedian Dana Donnelly. The live, interactive nature of the show allows viewers to chip in, so as guests fumble over questions such as “Qualitatively, what do you like about Black people?” viewers can – and do – roast them in the comments section. Roman apparently likes the way Black people dance and cook – but we’ll never know more because Ziwe stopped Roman short, simply saying: “I’m doing you a favor”. These moments – when Ziwe steps in to save her guests – are a brief reprieve for those who find the show lacking in generosity. But her questioning does, at times, feel torturous. Asking Roman (who faced a backlash after she called Chrissy Teigen and Marie Kondo – two Asian women – sellouts) to name five Asian people was never going to go well, and even if Roman could name 10, it wouldn’t be particularly illuminating. So what, exactly, is Ziwe trying to achieve with this exercise? Ziwe says she does not want her guests to fail, but she does believe in asking hard questions. “What comes out in my interview tactics is I’m actually trying to be nice, to be kind, to educate, not shame, necessarily,” she says. “Sure, I do it in a way that is really confrontational, but my goal is to help and heal people. I get comments like ‘Ziwe, you hate white people and you’re the devil.’ I don’t think those people necessarily understand the concept of my show or have watched a longer clip,” she tells me on an early morning phone call from her Brooklyn apartment. There are moments when her frank questioning captures something that sensitive questioning cannot. After Caroline Calloway proudly exclaims that she is fed up with white people pretending they’re not racist, Ziwe’s sharp reply – “Oh, so you’re a proud racist?” – reminds us that bragging about doing the bare minimum shouldn’t be commended. After Roman’s numerous defenses for her recipe for a bastardized curry (ingredients: chickpeas, coconut milk, turmeric) which she calls a “stew” – ignoring the recipe’s roots – it was refreshing to hear Ziwe ask: “Would you consider yourself the Christopher Columbus of food influencing?” “No, I wouldn’t,” said an irked Roman, who went on to define a curry as complex, while “a stew is a generic blanket term for like a thick soupy liquid dinner”. Lest you think she is too harsh on her guests, there’s a method to this exchange, Ziwe argues. “Calling someone a proud racist, it’s radical – it seems very cruel and intense and violent but I am actually making the statement that like, ‘Hey, we need to name this thing that is sort of plaguing our nation or else we are doomed.” Some argue that making people feel embarrassed is not a good way to tackle racism, but that often overlooks the other person in the debate: the person who is afflicted by a racist, sexist or homophobic comment, but has to prioritize the feelings of the offender above their own. In other words: why are we more worried about being called a racist than being racist? Considering she is a comedian, not an activist, to burden Ziwe with the far from enviable task of curing racist America with her show could be considered presumptuous. Why should her job be to change minds, rather than make people laugh? But she tells me it is supposed to be political during our interview, so I send her a text after our call and ask her whether the accusation is ever leveled at her: “Ziwe, I’m wondering, do you ever get people saying things to you like: ‘If you really want to change minds this is not the way to go about it. You’re putting people off; you’re probably only talking to people who agree with you.” “Nothing that literally, but here is a tweet I got tagged in,” she replies, sending me a screen-grab of a tweet, in which someone says: “I struggle to see how things like Ziwe’s ‘gotcha’ tactics are helping anything at all.” “How did that make you feel? Do you buy it?” I ask. “I disagree, but I encourage those who don’t approve of my tactics to join me in finding positive ways to effect change. I’m just doing my best like everyone else,” she says. Ziwe argues there are no wrong or right answers on her show, just honest ones. “The questions are designed to be impossible because ultimately the way that we are dealing with race is impossible. To pretend that you don’t have a racist bone in your body, that’s a fallacy, that is not based in reality,” she says as she suppresses an exasperated laugh. “It’s not an impossible question if you just say what you think,” she says. There are, obviously, incorrect answers. The internet has a furious appetite for wrongdoing: people are swallowed whole for making mistakes, and people often love to pile on, to admonish the wrongdoer. When this happens, there is no compassion, no context, just right and wrong – only, right and wrong constantly changes, and people’s moral compasses expand, shift and change overtime. At least her guests are showing they want to learn.  But Ziwe doesn’t really believe in cancel culture. “People who get ‘cancelled’ never really get cancelled, right? They get a lot of press and they are trending on Twitter but I don’t know if we see legitimate repercussions in their lives,” she says. “I think if you say racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist stuff then yeah, people are gonna be mad at you, and you shouldn’t be surprised or go home like a boo-hoo baby and cry. You deserve everything that comes to you, right?” This is a confusing set of statements, and relate to the main criticism that can be made of the show. If cancel culture is not real – with its victims suffering no concrete consequences outside of having their profiles elevated as the internet obsesses over them for weeks – it would be fair to ask whether Ziwe’s show feeds that publicity machine. Some will say there are impacts (Roman’s New York Times column was suspended after her comments about Teigen and Kondo). Still, to describe the show as simple “gotcha” comedy or a show based on the celebrity status of the formerly “cancelled” misses the mark. Ziwe’s former show, Baited, also used reductive questioning to remind us of our racial biases. In it, Ziwe deliberately race-baits her guests as a device to make people think about the way that we discuss race. In one episode, the tables are turned: Ziwe is interviewed by the completely un-baitable comedian Aparna Nancherla, who tries to get Ziwe to do something racist. They play a game where Ziwe has to help Nancherla guess the name of a celebrity – normally an ethnic minority with an accent. Ziwe seems uncomfortable, but she won’t bite.  “I want the audience to see these excruciating, hard questions and say, ‘Hey, how would I answer that question?’ I want to point out my guests’ racial biases, the audience’s racial biases and my own racial biases. I am constantly trying to critique culture. So if you’re asking me who am I laughing at? Everyone! Including myself, always!” It might be cringe-making to watch, but Ziwe warns that she doesn’t want you to just feel angry at Caroline Calloway when you watch her interview – she wants you to think about how Calloway is a product of the world we live in. She wants people to come away from the show equipped to have these conversations – something she could not do when she was younger. “I remember going to prep school, going to university, and I didn’t have the vocabulary where I could have these really tough conversations to really confront racism. I didn’t have the vocabulary to defend myself,” she says. For her, the show is not just radical, it’s a kind of therapy: “I am trying to think about my younger self. How would I want to defend that version of myself? I hope I am doing that for my audience too.”"
"Seth Meyers and his cohort of late-night hosts returned from a two-week summer vacation on Monday night to a country with surging coronavirus case numbers in numerous southern states. And after months of resisting calls to wear a face mask, Donald Trump finally appeared in public with the safety measure in place during a visit to Walter Reed medical center. “Wow, only four months too late,” said Meyers. “What’s he going to do next, drag his Christmas tree out to the curb? Start making sourdough starter and watching Tiger King? Govern?” During Late Night’s Closer Look segment on the administration’s vague guidance to hinge federal school funding on reopening, Meyers returned to Trump’s mask, which made him look like a “muzzled horse”, he said. “Trump’s team acted like this was a big deal but who cares? You’re four months late. It’s like someone saying, ‘Should we not do a live-action Cats? Now.’” Meyers also recapped the plan to reopen schools without federal guidance on how to handle coronavirus outbreaks, which was fronted by Betsy DeVos on TV this weekend. DeVos’s plan basically amounts to, according to Meyers, “it’s up to you to figure out how you’re going to keep your kid safe, and if you don’t, they’re going to unilaterally strip funding from your school, which they don’t even have the power to do anyway”. Meyers agreed that of course everyone wants schools to reopen, but coronavirus demands contingency plans. “No one knows how this ends,” Meyers said. “The best most of us can do is mitigate risk for the benefit of ourselves and others around us and take steps to make sure we’re ready for all contingencies. You can’t only have a plan A, especially when the guy in charge thinks ‘Plana’ is how you spell ‘plane.’” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also addressed the deja vu of coronavirus chaos in several US states that dodged the worst of New York’s overwhelming wave in March and April, which killed over 22,000 people. “I don’t know what’s worse, honestly – the fact that so many states opened too early, or the fact that they are now facing problems that should have been solved months ago,” said Noah. “Surging cases, PPE shortages, testing backlogs – these are all the same problems America was dealing with back in March.” The situation in states such as Arizona, where testing lines stretched for hours, or Florida, which set a single-day state case record over the weekend with over 15,000 new cases, reminded Noah of the moment “in a horror movie when the teenagers run upstairs away from the killer instead of running outside”. “This is like if they didn’t even run. They just stayed on the couch watching TV.” As for Trump finally donning a mask, “I know that is part of the reason Trump resisted wearing the mask for so long is because he is self-conscious about his image,” Noah said. “So let me go on record as saying: President Trump, don’t listen to any of the haters out there, who are saying you look like a diabetic Bane or ‘Shredder from the Ninja Turtles if all he shredded was cheese.’ You look great, so please keep wearing that mask.” “So coronavirus cases are skyrocketing,” Stephen Colbert said on his return to the Late Show, “but don’t worry, because the White House is working hard on an aggressive new plan: discredit Dr Anthony Fauci.” The nation’s top public health expert has been under fire from the administration after openly criticizing America’s numerous botched responses in handling the pandemic. “As a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don’t think you can say we’re doing great,” Fauci said in an interview on 9 July. In response to Fauci’s comments, Colbert broke out his Trump impression: “How dare you, Fauci! What kind of person would say America’s not doing great and needs to be made great again?” But Trump did finally wear a mask, “and I just want to say: Ha-ha! Fell for it, sucker,” joked Colbert. “This was all the long con. We’ve been wearing ’em just to get you to look stupid. You’ve been health’d.” “Trump maintains that he’s been a mask-man all along,” Colbert continued, but the president told reporters that he just thinks there’s “a time and a place to wear them”. “Yes, there’s a time and a place: pandemic and face,” Colbert said. And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon became the first late-night host to return to the studio since New York’s coronavirus quarantine began in mid-March, although with numerous safety precautions such as mandatory masks for crews, 6ft between staff, and temperature checks before entering the building. “This was truly done the safest way possible, and we would only do it that way if that was the case,” Fallon said. Having gone through the pandemic in New York, Fallon told viewers in states experiencing a surge in cases, such as Arizona and Florida, that he “knows how hard it is”, but “I guess I’m here to show you there is a light at the end of the tunnel if we all do our part to keep each other safe.” “I don’t know if anyone else feels this way, but normalcy, any type of normalcy, feels great,” he added. Later, Fallon also riffed on Trump finally wearing a mask. “Yeah, it was a really smart move – if today were March 13th,” he joked. “Years from now, that mask will be in the Smithsonian, and none of us will be able to see it because we’ll still be in lockdown.”"
"Elisabeth Moss, 37, has been nicknamed “the Queen of Peak TV” for her award-winning roles in several of the 21st century’s most acclaimed dramas. She played the president’s daughter Zoey Bartlet in The West Wing, secretary turned copywriter Peggy Olson in Mad Men and detective Robin Griffin in Top of the Lake. She currently plays June “Offred” Osborne in The Handmaid’s Tale, which she also co-produces. She stars in the new film version of HG Wells’s The Invisible Man. The Invisible Man seems a bit of a departure for you. What attracted you to the role?I’ve always loved horror films and secretly wanted to be that girl running around screaming. This role not only offered that but was an interesting character piece with deeper resonances. The story has been reimagined so it’s about a woman trying to escape a coercive, controlling relationship. Did that feel timely to you?Absolutely. [Writer and director] Leigh Whannell’s immediate take was: “What if you told it from the perspective of the victim?” because that had never been done. I thought it was so brilliant and totally timely for this era. Can genre films like this and Jordan Peele’s Us, which you also appeared in, tackle sociopolitical issues by stealth?That’s what the best horror films do, like The Shining or The Exorcist. There’s far more to them than what’s on the surface. The fantastical element means they can address those things without feeling like a moral lecture. It’s the same in sci-fi – Gravity isn’t just about astronauts but grief and the loss of a child. Genre films are at their best when they’re a lens through which to view issues. You’ve said The Invisible Man is one of your most challenging roles. Is that because it was so physical, with fight and chase scenes?People have got used to seeing me in emotionally challenging stuff, so they assume it’s the physical side that’s harder for me. And they’re exactly right! But I did as many of my own stunts as possible and really enjoyed it. Your character has a doberman dog called Zeus. What was he like to work with?A total diva! He’d never come out of his trailer and was very demanding about the catering. No, he was so sweet. They say never work with animals and children but I’m happily ignoring that rule. What would you do if you were invisible for a day?Go to a film set or theatre and watch an actor up-close who I really admire. Someone like Meryl Streep. I hope she doesn’t read this and take out a restraining order! That’s the least subversive thing I’d do, anyway. Everything else would involve sketchy, shady stuff. You move between film and TV. Which is your natural home?Luckily, I don’t have to choose any more. I can make a film that gets a short release in cinemas, then moves onto a streaming service and finds a whole new audience. People who were traditionally TV actors are doing films, while Meryl Streep is doing TV. Oh, I mentioned her again. That restraining order just got tighter! You’ve starred in several of the best TV dramas of all time. How do you choose your parts?It’s partly luck, partly instinctive. I look at the script, first and foremost, because writing is ultimately the only thing that really matters. If I find myself saying the lines in my head, that’s always a good sign. You start shooting season four of The Handmaid’s Tale next week. The role is pretty gruelling at times. Does it take a toll on your mental health?It’s been a great place for me to exorcise my emotions, honestly. Playing June has inspired me to be a stronger woman and advocate for issues I think are important. It hasn’t taken a toll, it’s helped me – in the same way that I hope it’s helped our viewers. The costume has become a form of feminist protest. How does that feel?It’s become a symbol of something so much bigger than a TV show. I feel proud when I put it on. June might wear a cape sometimes but she’s not a superhero. She doesn’t have any special skills except following her heart and refusing to give up. One of my favourite scenes was when June finds a DVD of Friends…Oh my God, how great was that? Any time we can incorporate reality into the world of Gilead, it’s an important reminder this is not an insane dystopian future, this is speculative fiction. It’s our world, our time, with parallels to what’s happening now. We’re doing more of that in the new season, actually. What will June be watching this time? Frasier? The Big Bang Theory?[Laughs] Maybe she’ll be watching Fleabag. What did you make of Margaret Atwood’s sequel, The Testaments?I’m reading it at the moment – except I keep getting bits spoiled for me by people on the show! It’s an unusual situation, like Game of Thrones, to be adapting a story that’s still being written by the author. You’re in Wes Anderson’s next film, The French Dispatch. How was being in his world?A surreal, dreamy experience. Just going on set, I felt like I was stepping into a Wes Anderson movie. I was dressed like I was in a Wes Anderson movie. All the people who appear in his movies were there. Even Wes Anderson looked like he was in a Wes Anderson movie. Who’s on your bucket list to work with?I’d always wanted to work with Wes Anderson, Scorsese and the Coen brothers. I’ve just crossed off Wes but I’d love to collaborate with him again. And there are directors coming up who I admire, like Jennifer Kent [The Babadook] and Alma Har’el [Honey Boy]. You’ve won two Emmys and two Golden Globes. Where do you keep them?Three Golden Globes, actually. But who’s counting? Just kidding. They’re on a bookshelf in my apartment, along with a bunch of memorabilia and trinkets from other things I’ve done. I should probably get something nicer like a glass cabinet. The Invisible Man is in cinemas from 28 February"
"Rafe Spall was born in Camberwell, south London, in March 1983. He joined the National Youth Theatre at 15 and despite rejection by Rada threw himself into an acting career, inspired in part by his father, Timothy. He has appeared in more than 50 films and TV shows, notably Edgar Wright’s Cornetto trilogy, Life of Pi, Black Mirror and the BBC’s The War of the Worlds. Spall is married to the actor Elize du Toit, with whom he has three children, and is starring in the one-man show Death of England at the National Theatre until 7 March.  CASisDEAD I heard a song called Pat Earrings by the London rapper CASisDEAD a couple of years ago and was so struck by it that I got his email address from Instagram and emailed him, saying: “Damn, this is one of the best songs I’ve ever heard.” Now we’ve struck up this friendship, but only over text message. No one’s ever seen his face – he raps in a mask. He’s only released a couple of mixtapes so far, but his particular brand of hip-hop fits in the apex of my musical tastes: it’s a bit like London Posse crossed with Kate Bush – and I just think he’s the best rapper in the UK right now. Sabrina Benaim I’ve been into performance poetry since I was a teenager (the Saul Williams film Slam had a huge effect on me), but I don’t go to live events these days because I’ve got three kids so I watch online instead. One of my favourite YouTube channels is Button Poetry, where you can find a Canadian poet called Sabrina Benaim. Not only is she a brilliant poet, she’s a fantastic performer too – I find her extremely engaging and watch her poems a lot. She’s a chronicler of love, disappointment, depression and all of the other stuff that makes for great performance poetry. My Name Is Why by Lemn Sissay This is one of the most moving books I’ve ever read. You can’t believe one person can take so much pain and then become a world-renowned poet, performer and intellectual. It relates how Sissay’s mother came to the UK from Ethiopia to study, got pregnant, and was forced to give him up for adoption. He went through the brutal British care system and was subject to abuse and humiliation, but he was in possession of an extremely fine mind and started writing poetry. Our culture is a deluge of terrible news and pain but there are still these examples of human goodness and resilience, and to me he embodies that. Fairview I saw Fairview at the Young Vic before it finished: it’s about race and the depiction of black people in popular culture. I don’t want to ruin it, but it features one of the most heartstopping endings I’ve ever experienced in a theatre. The play is about a middle-class black family in America and to begin with it could be an episode of The Cosby Show, with a gaudy set and exaggerated acting style. Then the scene is replayed but with white people commenting over it. Then the white people turn up in the scene and act out stereotypical depictions of black people. It was beautifully performed, wonderfully staged and it has really stuck with me. Growing by Amy Schumer, Netflix I’m doing a one-man play at the moment and to get my head around it I watched a lot of standup. I’ve always had a fascination with standup and I’ve watched pretty much every comedian’s TV special in the past three years. The one that really made me piss myself was Amy Schumer’s Growing. She is absolutely at the top of her game. It’s just masterful and so funny my wife was worried about me because I was laughing so much. Schumer was talking about pregnancy, with moments of seriousness and weight amid the laughs. It really is relentlessly, sidesplittingly funny. William’s, Nailsworth I moved to the Cotswolds last year and as a dyed-in-the-wool Londoner and lover of restaurants I was worried – I thought I was leaving good food behind. But the nearest town to me, Nailsworth, has a fish restaurant and deli which I can hand on heart say is absolutely world class. It’s one of the best restaurants I’ve ever been to but it’s an everyday place – you’d go there all the time. The food is really fresh and cooked with love – they do the greatest fish stew known to mankind – and the staff are amazing. It’s a lifesaver: it’s made my move to the countryside a whole lot easier."
"My friend Maik Hamburger, who has died aged 89, was one of Germany’s most renowned authorities on Shakespeare. He translated 13 of his plays for German theatre, as well as others by Seán O’Casey, Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams. He was also dramaturg to the Deutsches Theater in Berlin for 30 years, had a number of his Shakespeare translations published and, with Simon Williams, edited A History of German Theatre (2008). Maik was born in Shanghai, China, where in the 1930s his German mother, Ursula Kuczynski (also known as Ruth Werner), was a housewife who had a double life as a Soviet spy. His father, Rudolf Hamburger, also German, and an architect, was working undercover too.  When he was eight, Maik’s extended family moved to the UK, where they lived in the small Cotswold village of Great Rollright and remained there throughout the second world war. His mother sent him to boarding school in Eastbourne and after completing his secondary education he enrolled at Aberdeen University in 1949. Without completing his degree, he then went to East Berlin to join his mother and half-siblings, Janina and Peter, who had moved there. Maik subsequently studied physics at Leipzig University, where he became involved in amateur dramatics and met the theatre director Adolf Dresen, who was also studying at Leipzig. After university he taught at the Ernst Busch drama school in Berlin, the College of Dramatic Art in Leipzig and then at the University of the Arts in East Berlin, where he remained as a part-time lecturer until his retirement. His academic career ran in tandem with his three decades at the Deutsches Theater. After the fall of the Berlin wall he remained living in Germany but was for the first time able to lecture and lead workshops on theatrical practice and translation in various countries in the west, including the UK, the US and Canada. Following the death of his mother in 2000, Maik patiently dealt with a steady stream of journalists who for many years beat a path to his door to talk about her exploits.  I first met him at the annual International Shakespeare festival held in Weimar while I was making a documentary there. Later he helped me considerably when I wrote a biography of his family, A Political Family – The Kuczynskis, Fascism and the Cold War (2017). He is survived by his third wife, Gisela (nee Harich), five children from his three marriages, and by a half-brother, Peter, from his mother’s second marriage. Janina died in 2012."
"(Bong Joon-ho, 2019, South Korea) 132 mins After impressively breaking into (mostly) English-language pictures with Snowpiercer and Okja, Bong Joon-ho has returned home to South Korea with even more brilliant results. Parasite is both a satire on the haves and have-nots, and a suspenseful thriller about what happens when they all move in together. Amazingly, it has become a major force in awards season – and deservedly so. (Robert Eggers, 2019, Can/US) 109 mins Robert Pattinson fully justifies his status as cinema’s coming man in this berserk horror-thriller, in which he is the equal of veteran scene-dominator Willem Dafoe. They play lighthouse keepers descending into a delusional nightmare in 19th-century New England, the black-and-white visuals perfectly complementing the bleak, shifting mood. (Agnieszka Holland, Pol/UK/Ukraine, 2019) 116 mins There is a Guardian connection to this account of the activities of courageous Welsh journalist Gareth Jones; the paper published Jones’s eyewitness reports of the horrific famine in Ukraine in the mid-1930s that led to more than 3 million deaths and was denied by the Soviet government. James Norton plays Jones, and veteran Polish director Agnieszka Holland orchestrates events with clarity and flair. (Cathy Yan, 2020, US) 109 mins Enough people were presumably knocked out by Suicide Squad that a sequel is in the works; in the meantime here’s a spin-off containing arguably its most memorable character: Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn, inspiration for a thousand dubious Halloween costumes. Here, Harley has been ditched by Joker and is out to rescue fellow lawbreaker Cassandra Cain; it all leads to the start of the female vigilante squad of the title. (Elia Kazan, US, 1951) 120 mins In providing a great early role for Marlon Brando, as well as a much parodied showcase for Vivien Leigh as traumatised, faded belle Blanche DuBois, Elia Kazan’s Tennessee Williams adaptation has earned its place in film history. It might be a bit on the stagey side, but those performances pull it through. AP Last year’s fourth album, All Mirrors, propelled the Missouri alt-rock maven Angel Olsen into something approaching the big leagues. A Top 30 hit in the UK, it built on the success of the preceding My Woman by constantly keeping the listeners on their toes, showcased perfectly by its lead single Lark’s jet-black, string-drenched cacophony.Bristol, Monday 10; London, Tuesday 11; Manchester, Thursday 13; Glasgow, Friday 14 February Everything you need to know about north London’s Mae Muller is neatly tied up in new single Therapist. Over a jazz-inflected, Frank-era Amy Winehouse backing, she calmly eviscerates some poor, no-mark boyfriend, lyrically channelling early Lily Allen. Expect an abundance of attitude during her biggest UK dates yet.Dublin, Saturday 8; Glasgow, Sunday 9; Manchester, Tuesday 11; Birmingham, Wednesday 12; London, Thursday 13 February Finding themselves without a manager or label, north London indie waifs Gengahr started the sessions for third album Sanctuary at a bit of a crisis point. Eventually settling on Bombay Bicycle Club’s Jack Steadman as producer, they came up with a record that adds some much-needed pop lightness to lyrics inspired by death and loss. Manchester, Thursday 13; Leeds, Friday 14; touring to 21 February Norwich’s Bruce Fielder, AKA the DJ, producer and remixer Sigala, has been single-handedly keeping Capital FM going, clogging up its playlists with perfectly pitched Ibiza anthems. Since 2015 he has scored seven UK Top 10 singles, and worked with everyone from Nile Rodgers to Fuse ODG to Meghan Trainor. Would you recognise him if he passed you in the street? No you would not.Glasgow, Sunday 9 & Monday 10; Dublin, Wednesday 12; Belfast, Thursday 13; touring to 22 February MC Since his early-80s days making himself heard in the UK big band Loose Tubes, Julian Argüelles has made his signature sound as a sax improviser and composer – merging postbop, classical and Celtic and Spanish folk traditions – more distinctive with every passing year. Argüelles’s quartet on this rare British tour includes the powerful pianist Ivo Neame. London, Tuesday 11; Wells-next-the-Sea, Wednesday 12; touring to 23 February JF The London Philharmonic’s way of marking this year’s unavoidable Beethoven anniversary is more original than most. The 2020 series will bring together Beethoven’s symphonies with scores composed exactly 100 and 200 years after. The first concert, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski, juxtaposes his First Symphony from 1801 with Scriabin’s 1901 Symphony No 2 and Péter Eötvös’s Snatches of a Conversation from 2001. Later concerts include the second symphonies of both Sibelius and Beethoven, and the Eroica Symphony with Ravel’s Shéhérazade.Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Saturday 8 February It is a special week for Verdi fans, with productions of two of his more rarely seen mature works. Welsh National Opera’s staging of Les Vêpres Siciliennes is brand new, and follows La Forza del Destino and Un Ballo in Maschera to complete a Verdi trilogy directed by the company’s recently departed artistic director David Pountney and conducted by its former music director Carlo Rizzi; Jung Soo Yun as Henri and Anush Hovhannisyan as Hélène lead the cast.Cardiff Millennium Centre: Donald Gordon Theatre, Saturday 8, 15 & 22 February; touring to 9 May English National Opera’s production of Verdi’s Luisa Miller comes to the Coliseum from Wuppertal, where it was first seen in 2018. The updated staging marks the UK debut of director Barbora Horáková; Alexander Joel conducts and heading the cast are Elizabeth Llewellyn, Olafur Sigurdarson and David Junghoon Kim.London Coliseum, WC2, Wednesday 12 February to 6 March AC Once he stood stock still as a house fell around him. The strength of character McQueen displayed in the film that won him the Turner prize in 1999 has enabled him to bust out of the art world and make real, Oscar-winning cinema. Now he brings it all back home in a major show among Tate Modern’s greats.Tate Modern, SE1, Thursday 13 February to 11 May No artist alive contemplates the cosmic as intently as this American visionary. Turrell can make colours congeal in space or send your head on a rocket trip to the stars. His installations are like walking into Rothko paintings. Turrell’s project to turn a giant Arizona crater into an astral artwork links all his mesmerising experiments.Pace, W1, Tuesday 11 February to 27 March This Bulgaria-born, Scotland-based artist and designer shows drawings that explore the nature of performance and creativity. Radeva works with the theatre company Two Destination Language, and this exhibition came out of devising its latest performance, Fault Lines (which is touring to 15 Feb). Here are drawings to prompt the imagination, sketches that suggest characters and scenarios and provoke you to fill in the blanks. Summerhall, Edinburgh, to 1 March The oldest of the Young British Artists of the 1990s – he was born in 1958 – had a background in avant-garde cinema. It shows: his installations are Fellini-like spectacles of romantic desolation. When his art hits the spot, it is an operatic aria expressed in light and heat. He brings his pale fire to bear here in glowing and scorching artworks that should bring winter warmth to the gallery’s huge spaces.White Cube Bermondsey, SE1, to 19 April The spirit of dada lives in Genzken’s brilliantly throwaway installations. In 1919, dadaists in Germany used random stuff including tailor’s dummies and newsprint to make furiously satirical anti-art. She proves this can still be a potent method as she uses everything from fashion to – in this exhibition – airline seats to mock capitalism. And, as this show at a leading art dealer proves, the capitalists love her for it.Hauser & Wirth, W1, to 2 May JJ A new Tom Stoppard play is always Big Theatre News. Even better, Leopoldstadt doesn’t just showcase Stoppard’s wit, it is also deeply moving. Set in Vienna in the first half of the 20th century, the play follows one family over 50 years as they wrestle with their Jewish identity. Patrick Marber directs a cast of 24 actors, including Adrian Scarborough, Yasmin Paige and Alexis Zegerman.Wyndham’s Theatre, WC2, to 13 June Some shows are almost dead-cert winners. This has got to be one of them, largely because it stars the extraordinary Lesley Manville. Here, she plays the world’s richest woman, intent on revenge. Tony Kushner has transported Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s visionary play into the mid-20th century in a production directed by Jeremy Herrin (People, Places and Things).National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 13 May Former BBC journalist Juliet Gilkes Romero’s play is about the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act. As morality and corruption split parliament, two women fight for political influence. Meanwhile, a slave-owning home secretary endeavours to protect his own interests. Will the price of freedom turn out to be a multi-billion-pound payoff to the slave owners? A shockingly underexplored area of history is brought to life by director Kimberley Sykes. Royal Shakespeare Theatre: Swan, Stratford-Upon-Avon, to 21 March Lyndsey Turner directs Caryl Churchill’s haunting play, 20 years after its premiere. In a cottage far away, a child wakes to the sound of screaming. What is really going on, and will these ugly memories haunt the child’s future? This startling 50-minute play touches on terror, trauma, responsibility and revolt – and endless other rumbling feelings and ideas. The cast features Jessica Hynes, Aisling Loftus and Simon Manyonda. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 28 March Lorca’s explosive tragedy set in Wiltshire? Why the heck not? With Barney Norris doing the adaptation, this should be interesting and truthful. In a small rural town, Rob and his fiancee Georgie are checking out the village hall for their wedding reception. Rob’s mum thinks they’re rushing into things, and when a figure from Georgie’s past turns up, the couple’s wedding plans – and lives – hang in the balance. Jeff Rawle and Teresa Banham star. Salisbury Playhouse, to 22 February MG One of German dance-theatre pioneer Pina Bausch’s trailblazing early works, never before seen in the UK, gets a belated premiere 43 years after its creation. Its illustration of the violence, tenderness, fear and sexual obsession of one couple’s relationship is likely to be just as startling as it was in 1977.Sadler’s Wells, EC1, Wednesday 12 to 15 February Phoenix’s Sharon Watson and Kolkata-based Shambik Ghose and Mitul Sengupta explore two shameful incidents from British colonial history: the massacre on the Zong slave ship in 1781 and abuses at the Kala Pani prison in early 20th-century India.Leeds Playhouse, Wednesday 12 to 15 February; touring to 20 June Hip-hop choreographer Botis Seva won an Olivier award for the first incarnation of this piece, a dark, powerful work of oppression and depression. Now Seva has expanded it for a UK tour, inspired by his own struggles as a young artist confronting adulthood.Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry, Tuesday 11 February; touring to 30 April LW"
"Born in 1967 in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, Mat Osman is a founding member and the bassist of English rock band Suede. He studied economics at the London School of Economics, graduating in 1989, the same year Suede were formed. The band’s debut album won the Mercury music prize in 1993 and their latest album, The Blue Hour, was released in 2018 to critical acclaim. His debut novel, The Ruins, a story about two brothers, music and danger, is out now (Repeater Books). Them (Redfern Gallery, London) This fascinating exhibition was by a group of artists, musicians and party throwers in the 70s, including Derek Jarman, Duggie Fields and Andrew Logan. There’s an artist featured who died young called Luciana Martinez de la Rosa – her collages and paintings are amazing. They’re hugely stealable as album covers – so vibrant and human. I’d never heard of the group before, because they got wiped out by punk, so the show is almost like an alternative British history. I’m a sucker for lost artists and one-hit wonders; people who make something beautiful and then just disappear. What We Do in the Shadows (FX/BBC Two) You’d think a show about vampires would be all about power, but What We Do in the Shadows is about a group of people just trying to get by. It’s a TV remake of a film by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi about suburban vampires in New York City. They’re living a boring life, until an ancient vampire from the old country arrives and announces a plan to take over Staten Island. But the vampires are hapless. They try to recruit people, but fail miserably. It’s funny and charming. Matt Berry plays a 1,000-year-old sex maniac, and it’s the best he’s ever been. Universal Harvester by John Darnielle When I was writing The Ruins, I couldn’t find many good books written by musicians. Then I found this by John Darnielle from the indie band Mountain Goats. It’s about a guy who lives in rural Iowa in the 90s and works at a VHS store. Customers keep returning the videos as strange scenes have been recorded over them. He then sets out to find out who is responsible. It has the most exquisite sense of place and time and is genuinely unsettling. It would make an amazing film or TV programme. It could be a slower, darker sequel to Stranger Things. Intrigue: Tunnel 29 (BBC Sounds) This is about a group of students who build a tunnel under the Berlin wall to get East German families into the west. It’s a documentary and it’s insanely tense; there are mines, the roof collapses and the tunnel floods. I was driving and I pulled over three or four times, because I couldn’t get the next episodes to stream. I was standing in every service station between Manchester and Birmingham with my phone in the air, trying to download the next episode, as I had to find out what happened next. It’s thrilling and beautifully done. Bohren & der Club of Gore I discovered Bohren & der Club of Gore a few years ago and they are the strangest band. They make incredibly slow German supper-club jazz, completely wordless. It must come in at 30 beats per minute. I’ve never heard anything slower. It’s absolutely glorious. They did a record called Piano Nights, which I’ve listened to the most. They’ve made six albums and they’re all great, but it is cough syrup music. I’ve played it to so many people and 90% think it’s boring, very samey, but 10% go absolutely nuts about it. The Vault, Soho, London The one place that I always take foreign visitors to in London is the Vault, a bar on Greek Street in Soho. It’s fabulous. Incredible staff who really know their stuff. The bar is downstairs through a bookcase. It’s like Hogwarts with hard liquor. There’s a really nice crowd in there, too. It’s not expensive or snobby and still has that Soho vibe where people talk to each other. It’s one of the few places you can say hello to a stranger. It’s woody and dark, exactly the kind of place you want to spend an afternoon when it gets dark at four."
"Rather than address one of the biggest controversies in American sporting history – the “take the knee” protests by American footballer Colin Kaepernick – 2019’s Super Bowl deflected it with Adam Levine’s abs. Fronting Maroon 5 topless, his performance was much derided; the New York Times described it as “an inessential performance by a band that might have lost some moral authority if it had any moral authority to lose”. Praise be, then, to Jennifer Lopez for her performance at this year’s final. As well as being a triumph of hair styling, pole dancing and leather craftsmanship, this daughter of Puerto Rican parents also deployed staging that featured children sitting inside cages – surely a reference to the Trump-approved detention of Latin-American immigrants. There was female empowerment, too, with her singing dance troupe of girls surrounding her as she wrapped herself in a reversible flag – one half Puerto Rican, the other stars and stripes – as she sang a snatch of Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA with her daughter Emme Muñiz. It is a potent image: Bruce Springsteen wrote the song to be bitterly ironic; this percolates into Lopez’s performance. She and her daughter were born in the USA, yes, but are perhaps feeling less patriotic than ever thanks to Trump’s cruel policies. As with Springsteen, though, the melody has real nationalist fervour – the sound of someone wanting to love their country as much as they feel they should. Lopez’s statement is brave, because the Super Bowl’s reality-warping cultural weight means even innocuous moments such as MIA’s cheeky middle finger as she joined Madonna’s performance in 2010, or Janet Jackson’s wardrobe malfunction in 2004 (which exposed her breast for half a second), are judged as horrendous moral failings. Sure enough, tabloids are trying to confect a fuss out of Lopez’s crotch. But like Lady Gaga’s 2017 performance of Born This Way, which brought a queer pride anthem into the homes of millions, or Beyoncé’s 2016 affirmation of black female pride as she brought Black Lives Matter, Malcolm X and Black Panthers references to the stage, this is a show that is still about soft power. Lopez, with her co-headliner Shakira plus the Latin pop megastars Bad Bunny and J Balvin, sang at length in Spanish. It harked back to another Miami-based final, in 1999, where Gloria Estefan and Stevie Wonder were another multilingual, multi-ethnic vision of US cultural richness. As well as a site of world-class sport and music, the Super Bowl remains a place for the United States to hash out its idea of itself."
"Terry Jones had a love affair with beer – and he helped make it as well as drink it. He was a passionate supporter of Camra, the Campaign for Real Ale, and in 1977 he founded with Peter Austin and the Guardian journalist Richard Boston the Penrhos Brewery in Herefordshire. It was one of the early micro-breweries and it encouraged Austin – known as the father of micro-brewing – to build plants in many parts of Britain, the US, Europe and China. I recall going to Penhros on a bitterly cold Saturday in the depths of winter and sampling a delicious beer called Jones’s First Brew. That same year Terry officially opened the Great British Beer festival at Alexandra Palace, north London. He said that while wine tasters like to sniff, sample and spit, for beer drinkers it all depended on how the drink hit your boots. To prove the point, he proceeded to pour several pints of beer over his head. When he’d finished, he was drying himself off and changing his shirt when two photographers from national newspapers, carrying cumbersome plate cameras, came over and one said to Terry: “ ’Ere, Tel, we didn’t catch that – would you mind doing it again?” The great trouper that he was, he then doused himself in beer for a second time. Terry said that while the Penrhos brewery didn’t survive for long it did inspire others to follow in its tracks. Among them was David Bruce, who launched his chain of Firkin brew pubs. Today there are several thousand small craft breweries. In 2003 Terry contributed a piece for the 30th edition of the Camra Good Beer Guide called My Love Affair with Beer. “Beer, for me, is more than something I like drinking,” he wrote. “It’s a litmus of civilisation. If the society is making good beer, then it’s a healthy society.” In 2014, when the Pythons reformed in London, I contacted Terry and told him a small brewery in Yorkshire, Little Valley, brewed a beer called Python IPA. He was delighted and said he would order a crate for the dressing room. As he said in his Good Beer Guide piece: “Real ale is a civilised drink. Keg beer is a dead parrot.”"
"Sitting at a table at an east London gay bar, American comedian Jaboukie Young-White is making some last-minute tweaks to his standup material. It’s a Wednesday afternoon in November and later he’ll appear onstage for a solo show at the Soho Theatre. This is his first time in the UK; the first time he’ll perform outside North America. And while his act is well-rehearsed for audiences at home, he’s determined to make sure it translates. “You guys don’t have Popeyes here, right?” he asks, referring to the American fried-chicken chain. “But you have these things called Tories?” Young-White is 25. Last year, the New York Times described him as “a comic prodigy with a veteran’s killer moves”, and various American magazines, including Rolling Stone and Variety, have labelled him a “comic to watch”. Over the past five years he has amassed a substantial online following by sharing memes, shitposts, and quickfire political and social commentary – a kind of comic stream of consciousness. As is the way in modern comedy, that following has translated into IRL jobs writing for television. In 2018 he was hired by the Daily Show with Trevor Noah – a prestigious, high-profile gig for which he mostly delivers skits on politics as the show’s “Senior Youth Correspondent”. (“Why do we still use paper to vote?” Young-White asked in his first appearance on the show, addressing poor turnout figures among the young. “Paper is over!”) He later recorded a half-hour solo show for Comedy Central in which he recalled getting distracted by a statue during a sex-education lesson and lusting after a topless Jesus looking “cute as fuck on the cross”. For many, Young-White represents a new generation of US comics: he is black, queer, non-apologetic and huge on social media. Often his jokes zero in on gender, race, sex and sexuality, but, in the millennial way, they do so without taking aim at minorities – without making his community the punchline. His bits aren’t jokes about, say, gay people for the enjoyment of others; they are jokes for gay people who happen to be watching mainstream TV. “You used to have to take the piss out of yourself just to be able to perform,” he says. “But that’s something I was always reluctant to get into. Sometimes I do just want to send up the gays. But it can be tricky. You have to ask: who is this for? Who’s going to be consuming this?” Take a report he made for the Daily Show at Pittsburgh’s Pride festival last summer. Wearing rainbow-coloured Speedos, he explored the politics of the city’s queer celebration and came away with a segment that explored the topic of pink-washing – the tumultuous relationships between corporate sponsors and Pride events – a subject that is generally confined to conversations within the LGBTQ+ community. “EQT doesn’t just shoot hot liquid deep into holes in the ground,” he said of the fracking company-cum-Pride sponsor. “They also swing both ways by supporting pride and various anti-gay politicians.” Young-White’s comedy isn’t standard mainstream fare. “One thing I found interesting was that, by doing late-night TV, I was being put in front of people who aren’t used to seeing something in mainstream culture that wasn’t for them,” he says. “I grew up being so familiar with that feeling. So much shit wasn’t for me, so I’d just go elsewhere. But I find that for a lot of people that feeling is very foreign.” He thinks that young comics like him have had to disabuse themselves of the idea that they have to appeal to everyone, as older comics once had to. “I know I have my audience,” he says. “It’s them I’m here for.” Pint in hand, Young-White is in full swing now, venting about the brigade of comedians, usually older, who think “PC culture” has gone too far. These people aren’t freedom fighters, he says. They’re upset because their particular brand of comedy, which gets laughs at the expense of others, has all of a sudden become less profitable. “That’s one thing everyone should understand,” he says. “These people aren’t Rosa Parks on the bus. They are millionaires who want money. The nobility of it needs to be deflated immediately. Some comedians were built for the monoculture. They thrived when everyone was watching the same things, doing the same things. Culture is fragmented now. And they can’t handle the idea that not everyone likes them. And that, in the digital age, people can actually talk back to them.” Young-White was raised in Harvey, Illinois, by Jamaican immigrants. Like many comedians growing up, he thought of himself as something of an outsider. He was sent to white Catholic schools, for instance, while living in a predominantly black neighbourhood. “I know it’s a cliché of mixed people,” he says. “The tragic mulatto archetype. But that was my experience. At school I was bullied for being black and in my neighbourhood for being white.” Experiences like this made Young-White perceptive. He learned quickly that what might feel extremely normal in one place is not normal somewhere else. He began to think comedically about those differences, aware of the absurdities and intricacies of the different communities in which he spent time. Because he lived a distance from his classmates, Young-White relied on social media to keep in contact with them, and began to chase the dopamine hits that come with getting “likes”. “I started to post really bad jokes on Facebook,” he says. “And I’d message my friends saying, ‘Yo, go like my status on Facebook, I just posted a new joke.’” He’s laughing now. “I was so fucking obnoxious. They used to call me a Facebook slut in high school. Like, people hated me.” At 17, he auditioned for a part in a class production of Miracle Worker – a play about the life of deaf-blind American writer and activist Helen Keller – to give being a “theatre kid” a try, and landed the role of the protagonist’s brother. “There’s this one scene right before the interval where Keller is trying to learn how to eat at the dinner table and she keeps throwing the fork and smashing plates and shit like that,” he says, grinning. On opening night, one student actor went too hard and broke a chair on stage. Cast and audience began to freak out, unsure how to respond. It’s hardly fertile ground for comedic inspiration, but Young-White spotted an opportunity. He told everyone backstage he had a plan, then walked on to the set to survey the damage. Looking at the wreckage, he hammily gasped, “Oh no, my favourite chair!” “It was a five-minute laugh break,” he says. “The audience died, everyone on stage broke, nobody could stop laughing.” The drama teacher was forced to cut to black. “It was so fucking stupid,” Young-White says. “But in that moment I knew I had to chase that feeling. The director yelled at me, saying I had made the show about me instead of Helen Keller. I just smiled and said it was very in character, very in the moment. I wasn’t sorry at all.” When he graduated, Young-White thought film school might be a good fit for his talents, but it was expensive, and a writing course at Chicago’s Second City school of improvisation was so pricey it felt like a scam. “That was for finance bros and rich kids,” he says. “Why would I pay $600 to have someone teach me how to be funny?” So he turned his hand to standup, a “more egalitarian” way of getting his ideas out in the world. Slowly, he climbed Chicago’s standup ranks. He performed at open mics across the city, then graduated to five-, 10- and 15-minute billings. He moved to New York City, where he now lives, as soon as he began to consistently bank 30-minute slots. But Young-White has his brother Javaughn to thank for his burgeoning career. Three years ago Javaughn posted a bunch of Young-White’s Instagram posts to Twitter. BuzzFeed interviewed him after the posts went viral. “That truly was the beginning of my career,” he says. “I got, like, 25,000 Instagram followers. And all I was trying to do was annoy my friends.” But being funny and famous in the digital world is not free of its own specific challenges. He is aware that members of his own generation often scroll through joke after joke online, which can make an audience desensitised. When the amount of humour being consumed is at unprecedented levels, writing material that makes a mark takes more thought than ever before. There’s also the risk that, on platforms like Twitter, jokes get stolen. “Every month, someone with a big account will post [one of my jokes] as their own. I’ve done it in sets before and people afterwards have said they’ve heard it before. I’m like, ‘Yes! Because it’s my fucking tweet!’” Still, he appreciates the way spending time on social media informs his work. If tweets don’t get traction, he knows the joke will need rehashing. Young-White has a unique audience. A lot of people who find him online and come to a show might never have been to one before. “That’s a really exciting place to be in,” he says. “I can do a lot of shit and they won’t think it’s weird as they’ll have never seen standup before.” As much as he can, he brings the energy he shows online to his standup shows, using screengrabs of tweets and PowerPoints. He respects the power of social media, he says, as well as that of the more traditional one-person-and-a-mic comedy, and loves bridging the gap between the two. Comedy is important in the way it creates communities that are visceral and immediate, Young-White says. Getting a room of people all experiencing the same thing and laughing at the same time is “gorgeous”. But he knows that, at the end of the day, it’s just comedy. It’s not going to change the world, no matter what some comedians might think. “We’re products of our environments,” he says. “And that is so entrenched in what makes us who we are that a five-minute comedy set isn’t going to change it. A joke might make you think about things a little differently, but it won’t change who you are. That gives comedy too much credit.” Still, Young-White is very much a Bernie Sanders supporter. (In a recent Instagram selfie, he posed in front of a mirror, completely naked except for the word “Lit” covering his genitalia, and tagged it #hotboysforbernie.) And much of his comedy remains political, too. But before the 2016 presidential election he wanted all his comedy to be incisive and cutting – the sort that speaks truth to power, but since Trump entered the White House, that has changed. Creating effective satire is much harder now, he says, because “we’ve been taken to absurd extremes already”. But it’s more than that. Young-White now wants to offer an escape from bad news – to make people laugh at things he calls stupid and fun. “We have to have moments of transcendence,” he says, “where we get to just shut our brains off. Right now I think that’s what feels most subversive. We’re so plugged in, so informed and aware of injustices that any moment we can get to just be our unfiltered, dumb, pure selves and get excited about something totally meaningless… They’re the most beautiful.” Jaboukie Young-White is a correspondent on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah"
"A British museum is resisting attempts from Canada to secure the repatriation of sacred relics of a 19th-century indigenous chief because the centre where his descendants want to locate them is not an accredited museum, but the final decision lies with local councillors in England. In an increasingly acrimonious dispute, backers of the campaign to repatriate regalia belonging to Crowfoot of the Blackfoot Nation were told by officials at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM) in Exeter that “no one wants to get their hands dirty” when it came to the sensitive question of repatriating looted artefacts held in UK arts institutions. The resistance to attempts at repatriating items belonging to Crowfoot, who signed an 1877 treaty with crown forces, has demoralised those at a Blackfoot-run cultural and educational centre near to where he is buried, and which first lodged a formal repatriation request in 2015. “We are currently in our second decade of repatriation efforts, with no end in sight,” the Guardian was told by Stephen Yellow Old Woman, general manager of Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park (BCHP). The centre has a purpose-built room ready to house the relics, which RAMM purchased for £10 in 1904 from the family of Cecil Denny, an English-born member of the Canadian mounted police, who was one of the signatories of the treaty with Crowfoot. “It is like Siksika and Crowfoot are currently in a long dark tunnel with no end in sight,” added Yellow Old Woman, who dates the beginning of the repatriation initiative back to 2008. The impasse over the return of the sacred indigenous relics comes as the Arts Council has tendered for help in drawing up new guidelines aimed at reshaping the British museum sector’s wider approach to repatriation requests after European countries including France and Germany have committed to handing back objects. Multiple disputes over items in British museums include west African treasures plundered by British forces, from the Parthenon marbles at the British Museum, a long-running focus of Greek demands, and more recent requests by Gibraltar for the return of Neanderthal remains. Efforts to repatriate the Blackfoot regalia, which ranges from Crowfoot’s cream-hued buckskin shirt and leggings to a dee hide necklace strung with grizzly bear claws, have been backed by Alberta’s provincial premier, Jason Kenney. Canada’s Globe and Mail reported that he had written to British officials to say that the repatriation “would be regarded as a great act of reconciliation with Canada’s indigenous people”. However, RAMM officials told the Blackfoot historical party that the letter from the premier “has no effect whatsoever on how we operate here in the UK”. This reply was “just the tip of the iceberg”, said Yellow Old Woman, who added: “Much of this whole experience has been shocking to us.” In a document shared with the Guardian, RAMM said the BCHP was not accredited with the Canadian Museums Association and that details needed to be provided about the long-term preservation of returned materials. Details about governance had also been requested “to minimise the risk of competing or conflicting claims for the same material” but negotiations had stalled because not all of the information had been sent by the BCHP. RAMM has now written directly to the Siksika tribal council, elected representatives of the Siksika nation and part of the Blackfoot confederacy, proposing that the repatriation request is considered by Exeter city council’s executive committee in June. The letter also asked for information on the governance relationship between BCHP and the tribal council, plus sought clarification about who would have future ownership of the regalia. It added: “In recent months, debates on decolonising Britain’s museums have intensified. The response of UK museums has been disparate, ranging from examples of unconditional repatriations to a lack of engagement with indigenous communities.” The UK museum sector does not have a single, agreed protocol for dealing with repatriation requests, it added, and RAMM is currently reviewing its own process of dealing with such requests."
"In the two and a half years since numerous women came forward accusing Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse, the disgraced media mogul has come to represent the ills of gender imbalances in Hollywood, unchecked male ego, cultures of sexism and the silencing of sexual assault survivors. A slew of new films, books and TV projects explores the unfolding of the Weinstein scandal, what it says about the culture of Hollywood and the impact of #MeToo movement that followed. Breaking the Weinstein saga has led to book deals for several high-profile journalists, including the New York Times’ Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, and Ronan Farrow at the New Yorker. Farrow turned his reporting on Weinstein into a bestselling book, Catch and Kill. Released in October, the book is as much about Farrow and the spy film-esque challenges he faced throughout his investigation, as it is about Weinstein. Late last year, Farrow also launched a podcast that expands on Catch and Kill. And in interviews for the book, Farrow teased, like a cliffhanger season finale, that “there’s absolutely more to be disclosed”, suggesting his contributions to the #MeToo movement are not over. Kantor and Twohey’s book She Said, released last year, re-examined the duo’s investigative reporting on Weinstein, which included interviews with 80 women. It was an instant bestseller and is being turned into a Brad Pitt-backed movie adaptation. The Assistant, a fictional drama released earlier this year, revolves around a junior worker who is confronted with a pattern of sexism and sexual abuse from a celebrated film executive, and explicitly draws on the Weinstein story. Kitty Green, The Assistant’s director and writer, interviewed dozens of women in the film industry following the revelations of Weinstein’s abuses. Her film, Green says, was an effort to highlight the impacts of a system designed to keep a predator in power and a course-correction from many news reports that tend to focus on the predator, rather than the victims. Green told the Guardian she considers the growing number of #MeToo films as a positive development – one that forces audiences to interrogate their own behaviors and consider how they can make their workspaces safe and fair. Last year, the Oscar-nominated, star-studded film Bombshell touched on the #MeToo troubles of Fox News and Roger Ailes. The former chairman and CEO, who died in 2017, was accused by more than 23 women of sexual harassment, including the prominent hosts Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson. Elsewhere, the streaming platform Hulu released the documentary Untouchable, which weaves together the stories of Weinstein’s survivors and eyewitnesses to provide a compelling, comprehensive look at his crimes. Even when he is not directly mentioned, journalism on Weinstein and his survivors has become the source text from which many other #MeToo narratives spiral out. Weinstein’s presence looms large in #MeToo-themed episodes of shows like Tuca & Bertie, Law and Order: SVU, Murphy Brown, and Grey’s Anatomy. In Tuca & Bertie’s #MeToo narrative, Tuca, a parakeet with baking aspirations, faces harassment and lewd comments from the celebrity head chef she interns for. Tuca’s dilemma is that speaking out against the powerful chef feels like potential career suicide. Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, and many other Weinstein survivors faced the same concern, illuminating why it took so long for the allegations to break. TV also has widened its focus to other prominent, Weinstein-esque men abusing their power. There were the hyped documentary specials Leaving Neverland, which focused on allegations of child abuse by Michael Jackson, and the dream hampton-produced Surviving R Kelly. The Apple TV+ series The Morning Show, starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, tackles sexual politics at a TV network with frank dialogue, drawing much of its material from the story of Matt Lauer, the ousted NBC anchor who faced rape and harassment allegations from several women. A host of works have confronted consent and sexual harassment: Believe Me by Jessica Valenti and Jaclyn Friedman, which includes essays from writers about trusting women who speak out about abuse; Whisper Network, a compelling novel about a group of women banding together to take down a CEO with a history of sexual harassment; #MeToo in the Corporate World, which sees the economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett use datasets to illustrate the effect of the #MeToo movement on corporate America. Moira Donegan, the creator of the Shitty Media Men list and Guardian columnist, announced she would be writing a “primer on dealing with sexual harassment”. In addition, a crop of works focused on intersectional, underrepresented voices in the #MeToo movement appears to be on the horizon. One of the most anticipated novels of 2020 is the already hotly debated My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell. The Stephen King-approved book has a #MeToo premise: an English teacher discovers a professor she had an affair with as a 15-year-old is now romantically involved with another student. There is the forthcoming HBO documentary On the Record, which focuses on the survivors of color who allege the rap mogul Russell Simmons sexually assaulted them (Oprah Winfrey was previously attached to the project as an executive producer). The producers of Surviving R Kelly returned to television last month, with a follow-up entitled Surviving R Kelly Part II: The Reckoning. The two-night special examined another part of the #MeToo experience: the harassment and attacks survivors face after their stories are told. And the Los Angeles Times is running a podcast about the accusations against Bill Cosby that includes interviews with his survivors, some of whom are women of color."
"A gold telephone saved from a skip has returned to the art deco bedroom for which it was commissioned eight decades ago by the socialite Virginia Courtauld. English Heritage on Friday announced that it had been given a telephone that spoke volumes about the glamorous, over-the-top lifestyle of the inhabitants of Eltham Palace in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, south London. Courtauld and her husband, Stephen, were a millionaire couple who, in 1933, alighted on a medieval palace in Eltham and saw it as the perfect doer-upper that was both semi-rural and in easy reach of central London. It was fitted out with all the new technology, including electric fires, a loudspeaker system broadcasting records to rooms on the ground floor, a private internal telephone exchange and a huge centralised vacuum cleaner. At a time when most people had coal or wood fires, the Courtaulds had hot water pipes heating ceilings, floors and the first-floor quarters of Virginia’s pet ring-tailed lemur, Mah-Jongg, or Jongy. Everything had to be fabulous, including her ensuite bathroom, which was lined with gold mosaic and onyx, gold-plated bath taps and a marble statue of the the Greek god Psyche. Courtauld commissioned five gold telephones for the bedrooms and they were used until she and her husband moved out in 1944, fed up with the bombing. The lease of the house was passed to the Army Educational Corps which became the Royal Army Educational Corps (RAEC). It moved out in the 1980s and in the process all the phones, evidently left by the Courtaulds, were thrown away. Fortunately a sharp-eyed RAEC member spotted the gold phone in a skip, retrieved it and has now donated it to English Heritage, which looks after the palace. Olivia Fryman, English Heritage’s curator of collections and interiors, said it was a wonderful donation and the only surviving gold telephone that belonged to the Courtaulds. “This important object gives a real sense of the glamour and modernity of the interiors and the couple’s extravagant lifestyle,” Fryman said. “From being housed in bomb-hit Eltham during the second world war, to being accidentally thrown away, it is a miracle that this telephone has not only survived but finally found its way home.”"

"When Yolanda Bonnell’s play Bug opened in Toronto last week, she had an unusual request for the media: that only people of color review it. Bonnell, an Indigenous artist from north-western Ontario, creates ceremonial art. Her new play explores the effects of intergenerational trauma on Indigenous women and aims to focus on storytelling. Bonnell says she has received a number of racist reviews in the past – including one that suggested her work was more suited to reservations. She received an apology for that article, but after discovering that other artists of color had experienced similar treatment, Bonnell decided to pull the plug on white critics for her current show. “In Toronto, critics are mostly white and male. They come at Indigenous art with a different lens – that often comes back to ‘If I don’t understand it, that means it’s not good or it’s not a valid form of theatre’,” she says. “I don’t mind being critiqued. But at least let it come from a place of knowledge, of understanding what you’re talking about.” But what do other critics think of her stance? The Guardian’s arts and culture correspondent Lanre Bakare says he can understand the desire for fresh perspectives. A 2018 analysis by Rotten Tomatoes found that for the 100 highest-grossing US films in 2017, of a total of 19,559 reviews, 82% were written by white critics, and only 22% were written by women. Bakare points out that having a landscape where critics hail from similar backgrounds is limiting because it narrows the lens through which art is being critiqued. “One reviewer might not even see the same thing [as another] – because it’s just not on their radar, or because they don’t think about art like that.” But he also points out that skin color is no guarantee that a critic will or won’t be good. “One of my favorite critics, Ian Penman, is a white man who writes about Prince. He’s amazing because he brings 50 years of fandom to the craft,” says Bakare. The Guardian’s film editor, Catherine Shoard, points out that there is a quality benchmark that always needs to be discussed in a review, if audiences, playwrights, or readers are to gain anything from it. So getting a reviewer who understands the context behind the play is one thing, but assessing its quality should still be the primary concern. As an example, Shoard discusses the 2016 remake of Birth of a Nation. She says that when it screened at Sundance in 2016, people were so desperate in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite for there to be a good black movie that they gave it a standing ovation before it was screened. “And it was an absolutely terrible film. If that won the best picture Oscar, the achievement of [Steve] McQueen two years before that would have been completely undone,” she says. The Guardian’s chief theatre critic Arifa Akbar agrees, adding that sometimes white reviewers seem reluctant to engage with the quality of a play by an artist of color. She gives the example of a recent play by a famous black British playwright that got praise but without any of the rigor that a canonical play about the white experience would. “It felt as though white critics were embarrassed – perhaps to reveal their ignorance, or that they would be called racially insensitive. But it meant a lot of them ducked out of actually doing the job properly,” says Akbar. “I can see why that’s frustrating, patronising even. It’s almost like an inverted form of racism,” she says about Bonnell’s stance. But intellectually she says she doesn’t agree that you can silo off reviewing in this way. Akbar gives the writers Zadie Smith and Lionel Shriver as an example: both from very different backgrounds, but both arrive at the same idea when discussing the topic of diversity – that people should always be free to write outside their identity, walk around and imagine themselves in other shoes. Indeed, playwrights normally have to imagine experiences outside their own, and we trust and critique them on their ability to do so effectively. “I feel like we should abide by that rule for everybody,” says Akbar. Shoard argues one racist or uninformed reviewer should have no bearing on the rest of the population: “A journalist should be informed about the world,” she says. She gives the Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw as an example: “He is a straight white guy in his mid-50s and when he reviews a romcom badly, people say: ‘You should have got a woman who likes romcoms to review it.’ In fact, Peter loves romcoms. So for me, the idea that you’re not allowed to say whether you think something is good or not on the basis of your gender, or any other demographic, it’s just crazy.” Bakare agrees, but adds that in a field dominated by white voices, the criticism of the work of artists of color – including knowledge of their artistic intent and the context in which they create – is simply lacking. “If you didn’t know that Scorsese’s films frequently reference John Ford, you’d be slated because that’s seen as an obvious touchstone – but when the shoe is on the other foot, that kind of level of analysis isn’t always there,” says Bakare. Bakare points to a spoken-word artist, Danez Smith, whom he recently interviewed. Smith spoke about rarely being compared to prominent African American spoken-word artists, such as Saul Williams. “The link is rarely made because the critics [that are reviewing Smith] inhabit a completely different world,” says Bakare. Bonnell isn’t the first artist to say that white critics get away with not knowing the cultural reference points of work outside of their own interests – but doesn’t cutting reviewers from different backgrounds off limit opportunities for learning? That’s the point Shoard is making. “You’re just perpetuating prejudice if you are not going to let people experience other cultures,” she says. “If she wants more critics of color to review her, fine, invite them. But you shouldn’t stop other people from coming.” Of course, people of color aren’t a monolith, and many might dislike Bonnell’s work. And certainly, being a critic of color doesn’t guarantee an understanding of Indigenous art. Bonnell says anyone can attend her show and that she doesn’t assume all critics of color will share her lens, but she is interested in opening up the field so we can hear new voices. But – as Akbar points out – there are intersections, and it’s hard to know where to draw the line: “I am a south Asian born in Britain. Am I going to be attuned to Indigenous experience in a theatre in Canada?” The profession doesn’t just suffer from a dearth of critics of color but also female critics; disabled critics; LGBTQ+ critics and working-class critics, too. For that reason, Shoard says that Bonnell could end up excluding other minorities, even unintentionally: “It seems counter-intuitive. It’s not like everyone who is in a particular profession who doesn’t look exactly like you is some sort of very privileged enemy.” In particular, her concern is that limiting a profession on the basis of any demographic is a slippery slope. “You can make logic out of anything. If someone said: I’m sick of everything having to be viewed through a woke, feminist lens, so I only want white guys who are over 55 to review my work, there would obviously be justified uproar,” says Shoard. Then again, if a publication is only going to send one critic, perhaps demanding that they’re a person of color is at least a short-term fix. As Bakare says: “The current landscape is completely lacking in diversity. So setting up a criteria that says, ‘These are the only people I want to write about this’, [solves] that issue straight away.” For this reason, Akbar says that Bonnell’s exercise is interesting and important. “You do wonder who will be left to do the review. Just by making this request, she is showing how little diversity there is in theatre reviewing.”"
"From Adam and Eve in the book of Genesis to Shaughna making a play for Luke on tonight’s Love Island, human relationships have preoccupied us for millennia. So which are the books, films, songs and games that express romance in 2020? One of my aunts, hearing I was planning on going to a register office to tie the knot, said she didn’t get why people are “still doing marriage”. Well, the marriage rate is declining (as, apparently, is divorce), but it’s true that for the last 10 summers of my life, weddings have appeared like heat rash. Why people are “still doing marriage” is a question I find myself asking and being asked a lot. And not just by married persons like my aunt, though they tend to be its harshest critics. Also the unmarried in their late 20s and early 30s, surprised to find themselves increasingly outnumbered by peers who’ve decided to make things official – and not because of the legal incentives. I’m not moved to defend the institution in these moments. I’ve watched Marriage Story. I’d probably have opted for a civil partnership if one had been available, but it’s basically the same contract with less baggage. Most of my family, if they did marry (always after having children), did so on the advice of an accountant. But the idea of involving the state in matters of love came less from my family than from my own peer group. It’s a pressure people from my parents’ generation tell me they never felt. But it’s not as simple as a social media-driven concern for status, which is what my aunt implied. Like flat whites, extravagant weddings have become the go-to boomer explanation for why no one my age can afford a deposit. In her essay I Thee Dread, Jia Tolentino discusses the wedding-on-steroids phenomenon in terms of patriarchy, capitalism and delusion. She argues women are duped into it. That by spending crazy money on being the centre of attention for one day, only occasionally looking beyond the smokescreen of a wedding to the blue and distant horizon of “ever after”, a woman is distracted from the real sacrifice she is making when it comes to her (already limited) autonomy. Yes, some weddings increasingly involve obscene displays of wealth, where drones hover as couples speak their personalised vows, but just as many that I’ve been to are BYOB in someone’s back garden. I think there’s more to it than the self-optimisation motive Tolentino identifies. Witnessing the unions I’ve been to – queer and straight, traditional and subversive, family-only and the kind where no one seems to know why they’re there – one of the shared, if less romantic sounding or unspoken desires that seems to underpin each is a desire for stability. For solidity, even. To cement unions, take part in rituals and mark milestones into adulthood. Even as this desire focuses on the future, there’s a kind of nostalgia to it, perhaps not so different from the other forms swirling around in our political moment. For those of us who grew up in the 90s, when history was supposed to be ending, the desire to have love locked down seems to have got stronger alongside our uncertainty. I’ve noticed that when someone my age lets it be known that they’re not, in any form, going to formalise a romantic partnership, it can provoke surprising reactions from people who don’t think of themselves as conservative. It destabilises their own security somehow, and undermines the comfort they take from it. I realised I was open to getting married when I read Maggie Nelson’s The Argonauts, which begins with her marriage to Harry Dodge hours before California revoked its legislation on gay marriage. As the book progresses, she describes the pleasure of being in flux but also, increasingly, in fixity, routine, and things that are dependable. Of course these are things that can exist without recognition from the state, and are not at all guaranteed by getting married, but I suspect part of what moves young people to follow in the footsteps of previous generations and “still do marriage” is that it’s an established path that suggests a more dependable future. Olivia Sudjic “Personally, I like to leave the country. If someone took me on a surprise trip to Paris for the day...” London Hughes is dreaming of her ideal Valentine’s Day – and it’s no surprise she’s setting the bar pretty high. This is the standup who built a whole show around her outrage that, aged 30 and fabulous, she was still single. By chronicling a lifetime’s dating and fellating in her outré comedy To Catch a Dick, the Croydon comic blew the lid off the 2019 Edinburgh fringe and teed herself up for global superstardom. A Netflix special now beckons. Characteristically, she doesn’t demur when I suggest To Catch a Dick (not to mention her dating podcast, London Actually) makes her an expert on modern romance. “A hundred per cent,” she says. “This show is the dictionary definition of love in the 21st century. There should just be a picture of me on that page.” The show was born, she says, out of frustration that “real-life dating is never really discussed. I’m a hopeless romantic, a huge fan of romcoms. But I’m also out here in the trenches. I know what it’s really like. So I just wanted to be real and raw and honest about my love life – and see if it resonated.” It did. But why? Because, Hughes says: “People like to make it romantic and Prince Charming, but the reality is, I’m a single 30-year-old standup who slept with I-don’t-know-how-many people and none of them were my Prince Charming.” We hear about plenty of them in the show: the millionaire banker, the soon-to-be-famous boxer, the foot fetishist. And in lurid detail: Hughes demonstrates her favoured sex techniques, and obliges one male audience member nightly to do some demonstrating of his own. “Not one man has ever said no!” The audience response has been overwhelmingly positive. She’d expected resistance – because “British people are so prudish. Everyone’s weird about being judged – whether that’s about sex or about being a woman. On television, you never see two women talking to one another about their sex life in a real way. It’s never like, ‘Yeah, I smashed him, he came inside me, I don’t know how I feel about it.’” The only form of appreciation still denied to Hughes, six months on from fringe glory, is romantic love – about which she’s ambivalent. The point of her show, after all, was to say: “Yes, I am single. But it’s not, ‘Woe is me.’ It’s, ‘I’m amazing!’ It would be quite nice if I had a man – I’m shocked that I haven’t been proposed to. But I’m still a great person.” She’d love to have a romantic Valentine’s Day. But in its absence, Hughes won’t sit at home moping. “I’ve always been a person who lives her best life no matter the circumstances, “ she says. “I got bored one day and took myself to Paris for dinner.” Brian Logan It’s tempting to embrace the cliche of the virginal Silicon Valley nerd and say that none of Instagram’s programmers have ever experienced a serious breakup. How else to explain the cruelty of my account suggesting that I follow my ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend, complete with pictures of her on his feed? (I bitterly imagined an incel programmer cackling to himself in Palo Alto.) It used to be one of the peculiar curses of fame, that only famous people would be forced to see their exes going out with someone else, be it on TV or in a celeb magazine. But in a world of relationship-status updates and performative romance (I too had been posting pics of my new girlfriend on Instagram), we now also fall in and out of love under a spotlight. Perhaps that’s why pop stars, who are also living more publicly than ever before, are now writing a new kind of breakup song. Lyrics used to feature histrionic metaphor (“A total eclipse of the heart”), or were so plain they could apply to almost any breakup (“It must have been love but it’s over now”). In the age of social media, though, our breakups become more specific – she’s not just moved on, she’s moved on with this particular annoyingly handsome guy! – and so the breakup songs that resonate are more specific, too. On Lose You to Love Me, Selena Gomez sings: “In two months you replaced us / like it was easy” – a reference to how her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber started dating Hailey Baldwin shortly after their breakup. Halsey’s new album is full of nods to her doomed romance with rapper G-Eazy, while Ariana Grande’s Ghostin was about not being able to devote herself to comedian boyfriend Pete Davidson while grieving for her late ex, rapper Mac Miller. Taylor Swift’s albums are so rich with allusion they should come with their own footnotes. And on Never Really Over, Katy Perry says she “can’t even go on the internet without even checking your name” and adds: “Two years, and just like that / My head still takes me back ... oh, we were such a mess / but wasn’t it the best?” It was released shortly after she got engaged to Orlando Bloom, with whom she had earlier broken up. You could say this is all cynical gossip-mongering, and it is. These singers never actually name anyone, because they know there’s something grossly thrilling in unpacking these meanings, and since we feel as if we know these people intimately via social media, the lyrics take on extra potency. Take the Weeknd’s breakup song Call Out My Name, regarding Selena Gomez (yes, keep up), in which he sings: “I almost cut a piece of myself for your life.” It’s broadly metaphorical – which of us hasn’t compromised for the person we love? – but also very specifically alludes to the fact that he almost donated a kidney to Gomez. The song gains potency by moving from poetry to documentary. Of course, we can never truly know these stars’ interior lives. But their specificity throws heartbreak into sharp relief. By facing the detailed reality of our failed romances rather than wallowing in vague pain, we can learn about ourselves – and then, hopefully, cue up songs about falling in love again. Ben Beaumont-Thomas Dear Animal Crossing, you’ve been a part of my life for almost 15 years and it feels like a good time to think about our relationship. I first discovered you on the Nintendo DS. I was 12 and anxiously settling into a new school. I’d never met a game that just wanted me to spend my time fishing, gardening and socialising in a town full of anthropomorphic animals. You were cute and undemanding and you gave me the chance to play the stock market via the medium of turnips. Since then, you’ve been through a lot of changes. You’ve acquired new traits . I remember so clearly when Animal Crossing: New Leaf arrived. I was 19 and figuring out what to do with my life while on a family holiday in Kent. I had just finished the first year of university and I was feeling overwhelmed living in London. What I needed was the chance to escape into a world where I could shake trees to find new furniture and have a giraffe judge my fashion sense. You gave me that. Whenever reality has been turbulent, your bizarre menagerie of animal villagers have been there for me. Life may have demanded I march forward relentlessly, but all Marshal the squirrel and Astrid the kangaroo ever really asked of me was that I occasionally gifted them a peach. My closest friend was always Aurora, a pleasingly rotund penguin with an elephant-shaped slide in her house. I spoke to her every day – she would come round to my house, compliment my decor, then ask if she could have the things I was carrying in my pockets. If my real-life friends did that, it would have been weird. I love the way you express love and friendship, Animal Crossing. When I bond with villagers, they give me a portrait of themselves to place in my in-game home – perhaps a slightly egocentric gift, but then if I was an adorable penguin, I’m sure I’d do the same. When Aurora eventually left my town for pastures new, her picture remained in my home. On the back, she’d written: “Just keep your cool.” I used to play the game with my partner and, after we split up, your villagers would ask after them. Your innocence and eagerness never reflected the complex realities of my life, but it’s part of the reason I love you. You made things simple. With you, I pottered about, watering flowers and catching bugs. We existed mostly in comfortable companionship. Soon you are coming back in a new guise, Animal Crossing: New Horizons on the Nintendo Switch. This reminded me that I hadn’t visited you in years. So, with genuine trepidation, I dug out my old Nintendo 3DS and clicked on your icon. I felt a certain guilt – the same guilt we all experience when visiting a relative we should have made contact with ages ago. But what I discovered is that we are still somehow in tune. When I logged on, I walked straight into a party celebrating six years to the day since I’d last played. My slightly bewildered avatar was suddenly surrounded by all the villagers I’d spent years of my life with. Even though I’d ignored them for many, many months, they celebrated my presence anyway. Just as I was starting to have a crisis over the passage of time, Lyman the jock koala wandered up and asked me to catch a crucian carp for him. Suddenly the world was familiar and comfortable again. In the end, this is what love does for us. Holly Nielsen Oiled up, iridescent and alive with shimmering blue highlights on a glowing altar, a woman eagerly semaphores her partner’s entry. Her fluttering fingers mark the spot. Approaching the woman on her raised altar, her naked beau does a manly mince, all pelvic thrusts and menacing Māori grimaces to a booming beat, his gravity-defying erection cantilevering in the dark. And they’re off! Accompanied by arcade video-game explosions, thuddy bangs and gabbling shivers, this is 21st-century sex – on multiple screens. American artist Michael Portnoy’s Progressive Touch is a brilliant, banging new video performed by two real-life couples and two girls who are just good friends. Currently on show at Vleeshal in Middelburg in the Netherlands, Progressive Touch spares us almost nothing in the genital and oral departments, the universal mime of body parts, extrusions and insertions. Brilliantly choreographed, stage-lit and soundtracked, Portnoy (could ever an artist have been better named for this work?) has the dream that young lovers might use these hilarious, sexy and joyful vignettes as instructional videos. How about ripped-muscle anguish to a heavy prog beat, angular math-metal guitar rhythms and drumming discord, pompadour hair, boggle-eyed implorings, the gladiatorial torque of male torsos and the hydraulics and pneumatics of an oral encounter against shiny black curtains and a dangling cage. “I love physical comedy,” says the artist. “And you could almost see these as cartoons, like if Mr Bean was ripped and hot, had a dick in his mouth and studied dance in Brussels.” The boy-on-boy action gives way to two pale young women, coming together with chirruping “Ooohs” and a cha-cha score, its exotica pace underscored by xylophones and primary-school percussion rhythms on a big pink grope-banquette. After a lot of tongue-twisting dabbling they sprawl amazed at the quantities of sci-fi goo dripping from their arms. They’ve been at it, up to their elbows. ‘‘Why should a tongue go directly to a clitoris? Can’t it travel through the room in complicated, swooping baroque patterns until it gets there?” Portnoy asks. Foreplay can be all free jazz, he told interviewer Haley Mellin, “but to get off we need a good ole 4/4. As a progressive rock fiend, and someone who works with choreography, music, and comedy the question is naturally going to arise: what is progressive sex? By that I mean, bodies connecting in all sorts of strange meters, tempo shifts, stops and starts, changes in dynamics, unpredictable flourishes and permutations.” What’s love got to do with all this? Everyone needs to up their game now and again, to introduce the unexpected to the rumba, to remember humour and variety as well as duty. The girls collapse in laughter, the straight couple wind down, lit by a porno-blue strobe, while the boys, I’m sure, are at it again. Me? I’m off to the osteopath. Adrian Searle It took me a while to get into Sex Education. There was that very first scene. Here’s a teenager who can’t ejaculate. Maybe he smokes too much weed. Maybe the pressures of being the headteacher’s thick son, combined with that of having a legendarily large penis, are getting to him? (It’s the second, of course). But all eyes were on Aimee’s breasts. Did we have to do that again – build every new narrative enterprise around a fresh opportunity to show some fabulous breasts, bouncing up and down? But I minded other things more: why was Asa Butterfield, playing our hero Otis Milburn, doing such a faithful, consistent Simon Pegg impression? What were all these British kids doing at American Hogwarts? A truly weird school, Grange Hill on the inside, Dead Poets Society on the outside, stratified by jock and nerd (when did the baseball jacket and button-down shirt become a part of our aesthetic?), as if our entire youth culture had been transposed to Ohio and then filtered back again through Google Translate. And as for all those gigantic houses, evenly planted forests and suburban buses – the globalised landscapes of Netflixania take some getting used to. But I stuck with it, because it was saying something genuinely new about sex and love. And soon I didn’t care about the faux-Amish chic of their living rooms. Otis’s mother, Jean, is a sex therapist and, between one thing and another, he winds up supplying ad hoc advice in school. Apart from that marvellously intelligent premise, the core components of the drama could be any high school drama: kids fall in love, they don’t know if they’re in love, the person they love doesn’t love them back, the love they thought they felt turns out to have been lust, or pressure, or some other thing, and in many ways, it could be Beverley Hills 91210, with added sexual fluidity – because nobody said “pansexual” in those days. The difference - which is even more striking in Season Two - is that the characters are radically open about sex. Even the ones who are crucified by sheer distaste at the idea of sex can still talk about that distaste. They don’t talk about going all the way, or part of the way, or first base, or top-half only. They talk about fingering, shagging, blowjobs and masturbation. Otis demonstrates his “clock technique” for fingering on an orange, and you think: “Wow. I thought I’d seen it all. But I have never seen that.” Their anxieties, as a result, have shape, idiosyncrasy and definition, whereas in my day (stay quiet and listen to grandma), there were simply the two poles: repressed (boys) or frigid (girls); and shagger (boys) or slapper (girls). This gives a huge amount of texture not just to their sexual relationships but to all their relationships: it’s bizarre to be confronted by how different even a friendship is, between people who talk not so freely as specifically about what’s troubling them. But more than that, it makes you realise how much of culture until now has been a teenager’s sex life, mediated through an adult view (plucked from memory) about teenage sexuality, policed by yet more adult opinion on what to prioritise, then ventriloquised by teenagers emphatically not speaking their own truth. Adults tend not to talk about pleasure, as they try to help navigate a sexual awakening. This is because it’s so excruciatingly embarrassing. We are not digital natives. We grew up with mystification, not hyperlinks. We grew up with innuendo not Wikihow. We grew up with intense staring, not texting, let alone sexting, and would no more send a naked selfie than we would walk naked into a Lidl. “Just Google it like everyone else,” Adam says, when Ola asks him a question about dreams that he doesn’t want – or doesn’t know how – to answer, as if conversation and Google were opposite solutions, old school and new school. In fact, there are things people only talk about because they’ve got Google. Before Sex Education, I’d never seen a show consider the flipside: what if limitless information is actually a good thing? What if the odd bit of gonzo porn is an irrelevance, set beside a completely new dawn of curiosity without shame? I am deliberately not saying very much about what happens in season two, for fear of spoilers, but here’s one: the adults are much more messed up than any of the kids. Zoe Williams Edmond Rostand wrote his play in defiance of the new naturalist theatre of his age. Its fashion for realism “infuriated and revolted” him, so he plucked out a swashbuckling figure from the height of 17th-century French Romanticism and gave life to his verse drama in 1897. Cyrano, the “extraordinary poet and fighter” who is blighted by a large nose but blessed by the power of poetry, speaks in Alexandrine (12-syllable) rhyming couplets and woos Roxane with it through the proxy figure of handsome Christian. Martin Crimp’s Cyrano, currently at the Playhouse in London and starring a muscular, often bare-chested James McAvoy, rebels against the baroque language in Rostand’s script and replaces it with a contemporary realism that has its own heady rhythm and romance. This adaptation, directed by Jamie Lloyd, is written in rhyming couplets too but derives from the stripped down, streetwise language of rap and spoken word poetry. Poets like Kate Tempest and Debris Stevenson have shown us how poetry can intersect with the urban demotics of rap or grime; Jay-Z regards rap as poetry and Akala has spoken of the connections between hip hop and Shakespeare. Crimp follows in this vein, using the cadences of street argot for the central, poetic, seduction. TS Eliot believed that the protagonist’s poetic rhetoric was an intrinsic part of his identity and McAvoy’s Cyrano proves this point but reflects a much more modern and nuanced version of manhood than the “heroic masculinity” of Rostand’s original. The language embodies much of this modern masculinity and McAvoy’s Cyrano – an “all-time crazy genius of the spoken word” – seems vulnerable, urban and real. Anita-Joy Uwajeh’s Roxane, for her part, is a feminist who is not drawn to unreconstructed masculinity and attends lectures in “women and the male gaze in early modern poetry”. In Rostand’s play, the verbal jousting among Gascon soldiers fuels the testosterone-fuelled romance of the story. Cyrano uses words to woo but also to vanquish his competitors. He struts and peacocks and words form part of that display. The verse in Crimp’s woos and vanquishes just as seductively, though the leaner verse couples of rap battles and poetry slams. The soldiers hold mics or spit out their verse on stands, occasionally accompanied by a female beat-boxer (Vaneeka Dadhria). And where the wordplay of the original sounds arch now, the riffing with words here is razor sharp. But while this 21st-century Cyrano reminds us that definitions of poetry have broadened, it is still making Rostand’s point: that seduction is far more potent in poetry than in prose. When Christian tells Roxane “I love you very much” she replies “I’m so bored of being loved. Come on”, in the hope he can woo her with rhythm and rhyme. “If she is really in love with me why can’t I talk to her simply?” Christian asks and his question gets to the paradoxical heart of this play: the language of romance, whether in Alexandrine verse or rap couplets, is entrancing but not wholly trustworthy. Cyrano’s verse is heartfelt and dissembling both at once. It lures to deceive Roxane and also to reveal the truest of feelings, however covertly. Crimp’s script, in fact, goes much further than Rostand’s in interrogating the limits, or truth, of poetic language. The play’s third act, traditionally the balcony scene in which Cyrano ventriloquises for Christian from the shadows, takes place on plastic chairs in Lloyd’s production. The scene shows the power that Cyrano’s words hold over Roxane but it then deconstructs that power. Cyrano begins by speaking lyrically of his fantasies: of kissing the back of Roxane’s neck, of doing up the “tiniest buttons” on her sleeve. The description of love, it seems, is more potent than the act itself and Christian sits at a remove, scowling. But as Cyrano rhapsodises, his language gradually breaks down and shows us, in its collapse, that words can only be an inadequate approximation of the fluttering, soaring and ineffable feeling of love. “I’m speechless, speechless, all I can say is I want – I want – I want – there is no poetry – there is no structure that can make any sense of this – only I want – I want – I want – I want you, Roxane,” he says, and it is followed by a silence. For all of language’s power to seduce, this loaded silence is the most romantic moment in the play. Arifa Akbar Todd Phillips’s Joker is the solitary diner on Valentine’s night, sat like a reproach at its table for one. It has a painted smile, an array of second-hand catchphrases and a clammy air of desperation. Its presence alone is enough to make the violinist break a string. But awkward, angry Joker isn’t here for your pity. Instead, what this film really wants is your love. Whether it deserves it or not is open to debate. Few pictures in recent years have inspired such loathing. Few films would obviously so rather repulse than seduce. Bouncing around a Gotham City in meltdown, Phillips’s comic-book blockbuster - like Dickens’s Fat Boy – wants to make your flesh creep. It comes to show us the flip-side of the Batman myth, spinning a piece of revisionist history as written by the loser; governed by low cunning and coated in self-pity. Whatever passion it contains is unwholesome and twisted. The movie itself is an owl-eyed fanboy, infatuated with Taxi Driver and King of Comedy and referencing and manhandling them every chance that it gets. Its protagonist, God help him, is infatuated with himself. As played by Joaquin Phoenix, lowly Arthur Fleck dreams of being a stand-up comic, a billionaire’s son; pretty much anyone except the nobody that he is. Everyone else is merely an enabler of his ambition or an extension of his torment. The only man who Arthur spares – the only one he seems to care about – is Gary, his bullied co-worker, who requires a leg-up to unlock the front door to escape. So his compassion here is undercut by narcissism. He feels Gary’s pain because he confuses it with his own. Not that these ingrown passions are necessarily a bad thing. On the contrary, they might even be the elements that allow the film to emerge from the shadow of its illustrious predecessors. There is a theory that the dreamy epilogue of Taxi Driver - Travis Bickle hailed as a hero, back behind the wheel of his cab - is precisely that: Bickle’s dream (although when I asked Robert De Niro about this theory he promptly shot it down). Similarly, if there is a flaw to the otherwise perfect King of Comedy, it’s the way it expects us to accept that Diahnne Abbott’s gorgeous barmaid is Rupert Pupkin’s love interest as opposed to, say, his demented lustful fantasy. And it’s here (and here alone) that Joker arguably manages to improve on Scorsese’s pictures. It’s confident enough in its comic-book landscape (a place where concepts of reality are more elastic) to indulge Arthur’s disorder and let his delusions run riot. The man’s birthright is a lie and his girlfriend is just a figment. He’s lonely, unstable and pretty much without hope. Fantasies of public adoration and female attention are all he’s got. All of which ensures that Arthur Fleck’s a hard sell: the bug-eyed angry loner you’d cross the street to avoid. But this shouldn’t automatically make him a lost cause as well. That’s partly the issue I have with the more intemperate responses to Phillips’s film - the ones that decry it as a populist manifesto, a kind of comic-book Mein Kampf for the incel crowd. It’s an argument that’s as crude and tribal as it accuses the movie of being. Also, it credits Joker with too focused an agenda. The truth, surely, is that it’s as befuddled as the rest of us, a film borne out of the moment – a cluster of symptoms as opposed to the virus itself. If Joker has any message for the masses, then it is simply that hurt people hurt people and that society (meaning all of us) bears some of the responsibility. And maybe that’s fine. Maybe there are worse things to say and to show than a comic-book misfit who might stand as a proxy for the misfit on your street, in your family, or sitting at the next table. Film, after all, is an empathy machine. All said and done, that’s what’s most beautiful about it. Film invites us to walk in other people’s shoes. It encourages us to cross the street in the company of someone we’d ordinarily cross the street to avoid. Implicitly, unavoidably, Joker asks us to pay attention to the Arthur Flecks of this world, hopped up on bitterness, injustice and their own brand of fake news. It wants us to understand where they come from and worry about where they’re going. Love thy enemy or he’s coming to kill you. That’s hardly the most romantic of Valentine’s Day messages. But it’s best chance we have for a Hollywood-style happy ending. Xan Brooks"
"When Kylie Bracknell first proposed performing Macbeth in her native Noongar language, she received backlash – not from white Australians but her own people. “We’ve received quite a lot of ridicule for it from our own community: ‘Why would you want to do a dead white man’s story?’” says Bracknell. “My response is: because he is a human being and found a beautiful, melodic way to tell a story. And that is something that Noongar people have had a grasp on before time began.” Or, to put it another way, “Shakespeare is one of the most revered playwrights of all time, so why not?” On Sunday, Hecate premiered at the Perth festival to a standing ovation. The production, by Yirra Yaakin Theatre Company presented in association with Bell Shakespeare, was done entirely in Noongar by a cast of Noongar actors, making it the first of its kind in the world. And while Hecate is based on Macbeth, Bracknell has done what she calls an “interpretative” translation – bringing the goddess of witchcraft Hecate, a minor character usually omitted from performances of the play, to the forefront. I meet Bracknell at the Subiaco Arts Centre alongside Kyle J Morrison, former artistic director of Yirra Yaakin, whose initial idea it was to translate Shakespeare into Noongar and who performs the role of Lennox in the play. Hecate follows in the footsteps of a worldwide trend to translate, and thus subvert, classic texts into different languages, often changing English – which, in the centuries since Shakespeare, has become the language of colonisation and globalisation – into that of the colonised and the marginalised. In the mid 2000s, British director Tim Supple created an acclaimed Indian Midsummer’s Night Dream, performed in English, but also in seven other languages, including Sanskrit, Tamil and Hindi. In 2007, Perth festival presented the same play in Korean. In 2018, a Yiddish Fiddler on the Roof took New York by storm: famous spectators included Billy Crystal, Bette Midler, Hilary Clinton and Ruth Bader Ginsberg. A major difference between Hecate and these productions, however, is the decision in the former not to include any English or surtitles. “I wanted [the audience] to connect with all the facets of language,” says Bracknell, 39, who has spent two years translating Macbeth alongside her husband, Wirlomin Noongar musician Clint Bracknell. “Why must we have surtitles to things that should be obvious to humankind? The emotions of human beings: The tone of their voice, the quiver, the positioning or the body language … it’s these further perfections and imperfections to human beings that we miss on so many levels.” Morrison, 37, taut and lanky and dressed in a black singlet with chunky glasses and no shoes, is all smiles and laughs. Bracknell is the opposite: a thinker who is not afraid of long silences, pausing the conversation to ponder, as she slowly and deliberately dips her Dilmah teabag into her mug. She is also fierce. When Morrison admits he is losing his voice, she orders: “Don’t talk unless you’re answering a question.” He slaps a palm over his mouth, crosses his hands in faux sulkiness, and sticks out his tongue. Bracknell’s relationship with the audience can veer into the combative, too. She complains that one viewer in a preview session spent the entire play trying to read his synopsis. Earlier this year, she told SBS: “I’m not gonna sell this show, if people don’t realise how much of a historic event or how important it’s going to be, if people don’t want to be in the audience for the first-ever all Noongar 90-minute theatre production ever, that’s on them not on me.” But maybe such pugnacious antagonism is what it takes to try and do something new – and to claw back a language that today, as a direct result of commonwealth suppression of Aboriginal culture and heritage, is endangered. Bracknell wants to honour and revere the ancient language of Noongar, letting its beauty speak for itself and its rhythms wash over the theatregoers, without distraction. But there are political reasons, too. “Imagine being in a foreign land, where you don’t know the language and you haven’t had a chance to learn to learn the language. Now keep all the language points and suddenly place yourself in your own land,” she tells me, forcibly. She adds, with an acid laugh: “So if our people can teach a foreign language to us in our own country, surely the people that took over this space and claimed this space can use all of their ‘brilliant intelligence’ that they brought with them [to watch a play].” Morrison hopes that when Shakespeare aligns with Noongar “we can make magic and new culture” – a goal he also strove for in 2012 when he directed Shakespearean sonnets in the Noongar language at London’s Globe theatre. Shakespeare existed pre-British empire, says Morrison: “Before England went and colonised the world, Shakespeare was for the people. One of the beautiful things that we are looking to do is to decolonise and give it back to the people.” Yet his ties to English are complex. “English has done more to keep us in a psychological prison than those prisons out there have done,” says Morrison, gesticulating with both hands to the world beyond the arts centre, listing terms such as “pagan”, “uncivilised” and “hunter-gatherer” as problematic. By contrast, performing in Noongar, which Morrison learnt for the production, has created “a deep-seated contentment in my guts that nothing in the world has ever provided. It’s almost like 1.5-hour prayer for me.” Like Morrison, most of the actors in Hecate have had to either learn Noongar from scratch or build on patchy vocabulary. To try and speed up their fluency, Bracknell directed the rehearsals in Noongar too. Such tenacity did not go unnoticed on opening night. “It was awesome. You never have a play like that in language,” said Noongar-Wongi woman Cherie Yorkshire, 42, whose son was performing. Her father, Warren Yorkshire, 64, who speaks Noongar and translated for Cherie throughout the play, added: “We should be embracing this. It tells the young people in the community that they have got lingo and they can use it.” It is 5pm and Bracknell makes her excuses – she wants to spend time with her 23-month-old son before the preview begins, again, that night. As I walk down the steps a few minutes later, I see her crouching down with him in the theatre foyer as he babbles away excitedly. He is talking in Noongar.

"Lesley Manville is, at 63, at the top of her game. Nominated for an Oscar for her part in Phantom Thread and now doted on by Hollywood, she returns to the National Theatre to star in Tony Kushner’s new version of Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s tragicomedy The Visit. Friedrich Dürrenmatt said the leading lady in The Visit was a “wicked creature, and for precisely that reason must not be played wicked”. Do you agree? How are you approaching the role?Claire Zachanassian was damaged as a teenager and never got over it. She comes back to her home town, which Tony Kushner has relocated to upstate New York – a fictitious town called Slurry based on north-west New York state, around the shores of Lake Erie. She left home as a 16-year-old orphan. Now, she is back as the world’s richest woman. The townsfolk think she has an open heart and will improve the town’s fortunes, but she has returned for revenge. The question of her wickedness is a delicate one. It is vital to understand her. She is highly intelligent, dark and witty and during the course of the evening her soul is laid bare. What does being in your 60s mean – is there new licence to be a wicked old lady yourself?I don’t think of myself as old. I feel at the top of my form as an actor and a woman: free, liberated, energised. I want this feeling to stay – I’d quite like to lock it – because I know I’m not what you’d call young but don’t feel I’m what you would call old. I don’t conform to the stereotype of a 63-year-old. I still dress young – although not inappropriately. I know that, in the next decade, all sorts of things I can’t quite imagine will probably kick in. I’m still incredibly physically agile and energetic, but don’t know if that is going to get crushed the older I get. Is your stamina in your genes?There’s an inherent thing in my brain that makes me work hard. I don’t take any job for granted. I learn my lines. I know what I’m doing. I come in good spirit, good faith and with humour. I don’t ever want to slow up. I work with people much younger than me who sometimes don’t turn up prepared and I find that aggravating and inexcusable. And then in the next sentence, they’ll say: “I hope when I’m your age, I have your career,” and I feel like saying: “Well, buck up and get your act together a bit more.” What was it like being discovered by Hollywood after half a century?Extraordinary… I’m glad it happened when it did, because to be really successful in your 20s or 30s is hard to sustain. I knew who I was and what I was capable of as an actor and so it is a gorgeous cherry on the cake. Also, because I was working with Paul Thomas Anderson, I was not in a fake glitzy world of Hollywood, the work was a segue from Mike Leigh. Phantom Thread came left of field. I did not have to compromise to do it – or get Botoxed [laughs]. But I did go hopping and skipping and giggling to the Oscars because… why wouldn’t you? Which of your roles is closest to your own character?I’m a good mum like Cathy [in BBC sitcom Mum] although not as patient and more judgmental. I can be dark and witty like Claire Zachanassian. And there’s Mary, in Another Year – the sad, lonely alcoholic. Not that I’m a sad, lonely alcoholic, but I can tap into that wistfulness. And there have been times when I’ve felt the depths of loneliness and probably drunk too much of a bottle of red wine on my own in the evening. So I’ve been Mary but – thankfully – that has been transitory. Making the film Ordinary Love must have brought you very close to the experience of having cancer…My eldest sister went through breast cancer and had the five-year all-clear. I knew something of the experience from her. What also helped is that the staff – the chemo and biopsy nurses and technicians in the film – were, with the exception of the oncologist, real. That was incredibly valuable. And the script lent itself to being treated in a realistic way. You cannot make a film like that and sentimentalise or sensationalise it – you owe it to all those women who go through this awful thing to do it properly. My elder sister died last year of a different cancer. It is all around us, isn’t it? People say health is the most important thing in life. What is most important after that?Humour. It’s hugely important. I live on my own and that’s fine, I enjoy it, I’ve fine-tuned it, but I’m grateful to come to work with 20 or 30 people with whom I can have nice conversations and a laugh. Does success change you?My poor sisters – both older than me – said that from age four on, I was bossing them around. Has success changed me? Well, no is the truth. I live a very average, normal life. I don’t travel around in cars unless I’m being picked up to go filming at five in the morning.  What do you like doing when not working?It’s because I live on my own that home is my sanctuary. It’s simple: I like to go home and have something nice to eat and am currently obsessed with watching Succession – my fix in the evenings. No big secrets really. I’m very happy in my own head and space. What future roles are lined up for you?I’ve a cameo in the film Misbehaviour, about the 1970 Miss World competition, and I’m in Let Him Go with Kevin Costner, playing a North Dakota, peroxide-blond chain-smoking mama. And Ordinary Love is about to open in the States. In one of my little breaks from the play in February I’m popping over to give Liam Neeson a hug and take him on the circuit. The Visit runs in repertory at the National Theatre until 13 May"
"My father, David Rainger, who has died aged 98, was a former chair of the William Morris Society who, outside his working life as a telephone engineer, pursued interests in pottery, bookbinding, stained glass crafting and politics. Born in Paddington, west London, David grew up in nearby Fulham, where his father, George, was a highly skilled plumber and his mother, Ellen (nee Bennett), was a couture seamstress. He attended Paddington Technical Institute, where the blend of academic, technical and craft education suited his abilities and provided him with a range of skills and interests that he pursued throughout his life. Beginning work in 1938 as a “youth in training”’ with Post Office Telephones, he immediately joined the Post Office Engineering union, and was soon elected as its youth officer for his district. His career was interrupted in 1942 when he was called up to the RAF, after which he was re-assigned to the Royal Signals, working on communications equipment in England and the far east. He married Margaret Thorpe, a secretary, in 1944, after meeting her at a Wiltshire youth hostel when they were both on cycling holidays with friends. But it was not until David’s return from Singapore in 1947 that they began to settle down properly. Resuming his job, David then progressed through a range of increasingly senior roles, retiring as an executive engineer. As well as starting a family, David and Margaret studied literature, economics and politics with the Workers’ Educational Association (now WEA), and became involved in its regional organisation in Wimbledon. They were also active members of CND and the Labour party, and stood as candidates for Labour in various local elections in the south-west London suburb of New Malden, where they lived. After retirement at 60, David took time to travel, to take an Open University degree in politics and society and to learn to make pottery and stained glass. He later attended bookbinding classes, and afterwards repaired volumes for the William Morris Society library in Hammersmith. As a member of the society, David was able to tap into his affinity with creativity and radical politics. He was its chair in 1996, the year of the centenary of Morris’s death, during which he gave a series of passionate speeches at locations around Hammersmith where Morris had spoken, condemning the evils of capitalism and calling for a radical socialist alternative. Morris’s London home, Kelmscott House, has a display of stained glass quarries by Edward Burne-Jones and Morris, which David reassembled from hundreds of shards. He is survived by Margaret, his three children, four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren."
"In our new series Stream Team, Guardian Australia’s arts writers dig out their favourite hidden gems of streaming to help you while away some isolated hours. – In this new age of closed borders and grounded flights, a lot of us are going to be turning to travel shows – and realising that most are in the business of lying to you. “The flight is just a quick hop across the Pacific!” says a persimon-coloured woman in white linen. “It’s a luxury hotel – but it’s surprisingly affordable!!” says a man wearing tan chinos and dress shoes on the beach. Travel Man – which has seasons streaming on SBS On Demand – is one of the very few that shows travel for what it is: simultaneously the very best and absolute worst thing you can do. “The mini-break is a noodley soup of nincompoopery,” says long-time host Richard Ayoade in one episode. “To mini-break is to prise open the crack of crazy, behind which lurks the absurd notion of leaving your house, certain motion sickness, and the terrifying prospect of interacting with other cultures,” he says in another. At the start of each show he stands, stiff and sceptical, in the middle of a dazzling European city and says: “We’re here – but should we have come?” Travel Man has been a hit in the UK since 2015, but I only discovered it in the past year or so while shuffling through On Demand. In each 30-minute episode, Ayoade (comedian, writer, director, and most famously Moss from The IT Crowd) pairs up with a different celebrity for a 48-hour mini-break. They explore a city, try the local food, hit the tourist spots and very begrudgingly have a good time. In anyone else’s hands that would get tedious (see: An Idiot Abroad), but Ayoade is so infectiously kind that even his outright cynicism comes across as fun. He’s loquacious, neurotic and witty about the silly joys and annoyances of travel. The show’s at its best when he’s paired with someone who knows how to bounce off that extremely British tendency to complain. Not surprisingly, some of the best episodes are the ones with his mates. In Copenhagen, Ayoade and Mighty Boosh co-star Noel Fielding drink schnapps and have cute antics at Tivoli amusement park. When Ayoade complains, Fielding smiles and says, “I thought this was going to be a holiday – not one of your weird, anally retentive fright-fests”. The episode in Vienna with The IT Crowd’s Chris O’Dowd is also worth a watch – if only for this scene in a snowglobe store. Other celebrities featured on the show include Dawn French, Stephen Merchant, Rob Delaney and Australia’s Adam Hills – all big names in UK comedy. But another, somewhat more unlikely, match is US actor Jon Hamm. In a longer Christmas episode, Hamm and Ayoade travel to Hong Kong and get foot massages, buy tailored pink and red velvet suits, and practice tai chi. Other Americans (see: Lena Dunham) are a bit too flat and earnest, but Hamm (and Paul Rudd, who also appears on the show) has a big goofy energy that offsets Ayoade’s deadpan charm. A travel show might sound like a frustrating watch right now. I get that. Some of the most renowned tourist sites in the world are ghost towns, and you’re more likely to be grieving a cancelled trip right now than planning a new one. But as your whole world shrinks to the size of your lounge room, it’s important to remember that this isn’t permanent. This will pass. There will be more trips to plan. For now, all we can do is look out to the other side: to a time when you can jet off to explore the world with your closest friends, and inevitably complain about motion sickness and lines and prices and sore feet the whole time."
"At 79, Sir Patrick Stewart is back in the role of Jean-Luc Picard, and boldly going somewhere no USS Enterprise captain has gone before – their own Star Trek spin-off show. But it was terrestrial matters that were concerning him more at the London premiere of the new series Star Trek: Picard on Wednesday night, where he described Brexit as “the grimmest thing” to have happened to him in his political life.“It makes me very, very sad,” Stewart told PA Media. “I think what is happening with the European Union is actually the saddest, grimmest thing that has happened to me since I have been involved in politics.”Having first played the part of Picard when Star Trek: The Next Generation hit screens in 1987, the new web television series sees him return to the role after a gap of 18 years. Stewart says he had met the producers of new show intent to turn them down face-to-face, only to find their ideas for how the character of Jean-Luc Picard had developed compelling. “I began to realise it was something I had to do, and what a smart decision. There was a quality about Jean-Luc Picard that I had felt from the very beginning that was unlike any acting experience I had before.” The actor, who has been vocal in his opposition to Brexit, has ditched plans to try and gain US citizenship in order to vote against Donald Trump. Speaking on the Star Trek-themed white carpet outside the event in London’s Leicester Square, he said: “I think we have our own Trump in our country here today, so I am going to be using my vote to try and get rid of him.”Star Trek: Picard is attempting to be the best of both worlds to Trekkers old and new. It brings back some much-loved characters, piquing the interest perhaps of a generation of 90s fans who had fallen by the wayside. But it also puts them firmly in the current Star Trek universe, with the kind of cinematography and sleek special effects you’d expect from a high budget production made for the streaming TV era.And to celebrate the launch London Underground’s Piccadilly Circus station was rebranded as ‘Picard-illy Circus’, complete with Starfleet insignia on the famous roundels.  While Stewart may be being made very sad by Brexit, his spirits were lifted by long-time friend Sir Ian McKellen, who jokingly proposed to him outside the premiere. Jeri Ryan, who reprises her role as Seven Of Nine in the new show, said of it that “Old fans will be happy, and people who might not think they want to watch Star Trek will impressed”.Internationally Star Trek: Picard will be streaming on Amazon Prime Video from 24 January, a day after its first US showing on the CBS All Access streaming service in the US"
"As if we needed more reasons to love Helen Mirren. In the latest example of a favoured genre of story – Hollywood stars turning up in random UK places (see also: Nicolas Cage spending New Year’s Eve in a Somerset pub), Mirren has been delighting fans with her Instagram posts detailing her jaunts around Bradford. Mirren, along with Jim Broadbent, is in Bradford filming her upcoming film The Duke, the true story of an art heist. And it seems the actor has really taken to the West Yorkshire city and all it has to offer. Mirren started her documentation with a night-time snap of one of the city’s mills with the caption: “The one and only Bradford with its own magic.” The next day, she upped her game. “Last night at The Panto Snow White in the magnificent Alhambra Theater in Bradford I yelled ‘he’s behind you’ and wearing my lit up blue tiara and laughed my socks off at 2 legends Billy Pearce and Paul Chuckle. It was an honour to meet them afterwards. Thank you, you guys are truely [sic] awesome.”  Clearly having the time of her life, Mirren next snapped her dinner, giving a shoutout to a local restaurant. “Nothing like indian/pakistani dinner in Bradford doesn’t get any better, Thank you Mumtaz.” But perhaps Mirren’s most joyous post of all was a wonderful picture of four friends dressed up in leg warmers and shell suits, complete with crimped hair and retro shades. “Some gals having a great eighties night out in Bradford,” Mirren wrote. Imagine being approached by Helen Mirren wanting to photograph you in your fancy dress finery. Mirren’s Yorkshire posts have proved extremely popular, with tens of thousands of likes. In particular, there is something very sweet about her namechecking Bradford in each post, lest we think she is back in Los Angeles at the Golden Globes, where she was just a week ago. Incidentally, here’s her last (pre-Bradford) post from New York: As witnessed by the fact other recent posts include a cheese sarnie as her “favourite supper”, and the following post in which she eats chips from a cone, handbag discarded next to her, the Oscar-winner has always been refreshingly down to earth. Basically, what I’m saying is: Bradford, give her the Freedom of the City. Or even better: make her mayor."
"Josh Thomas wrote much of his Emmy award-winning comedy-drama Please Like Me while sitting on a sofa with fellow writers Thomas Ward (also his childhood friend and co-star) and Liz Doran. Creating his new show, Everything’s Gonna Be Okay, couldn’t have been more different. Moving to Los Angeles – as an “alien of extraordinary ability”, according to his visa – he found that a typical “notes” session for the show might involve a conference call with 16 other people. For someone with a solidly self-deprecating sense of humour and a background in the solitary world of standup, that approach had to have been uncomfortable. “I’m not used to it,” he confirms to Guardian Australia. “In America you have to be very brave, confident and vocal. I’d finish calls by saying, ‘So, the things that people need to do as a follow-up are … ’, and then there’d be an agenda of next steps. I’d think, I can’t believe what I’ve turned into. All that corporate speak – ‘I’m just looping back to this’, ‘If we could just lean into this’. But you have to learn not to be obtuse.” Feeling like a fish out of water is in fact the premise of his new show for Disney-owned cable network Freeform, where it will premiere on 17 January – at the same time as the first three episodes land on Australian streaming service Stan. He plays Nicholas, a gay 25-year-old Australian who suddenly finds himself the guardian of two American half-sisters when his father, who lives with them in the United States, dies of cancer. It took Thomas years to successfully pitch the idea of Please Like Me to the ABC; by contrast, Everything’s Gonna Be Okay – or at least the first two episodes available to preview – feels rushed at first. There’s some dizzying exposition in the opening scene of episode one, in which Nicholas answers questions about himself posed by a guy he has picking up in a bar (Alex, played by Adam Faison) between bouts of necking on. Later, Nicholas’s father (Christopher May) utters the immortal line: “I have a terrible cancer which I’ll give you some more information about later, but this is the news that I need to tell you now.” Cue sad music. “Pilots are the hardest thing in the world,” Thomas says. “There’s always a lot of premise, which isn’t my favourite thing. My favourite thing is when you know the people and you get to hang out with them.” The show certainly feels more like an American sitcom than the critically adored “home-cooked pleasures” of its predecessor. The humour is broader, the colours more vibrant, the high school tropes a little heavy-handed – but by the second episode the pace settles and the character quirks and meandering dialogue Thomas imbued Please Like Me with are allowed to take root. Please Like Me was imported at the tail-end of a time when it was more common for US networks to remake international shows. In fact, that was initially the plan of Pivot, the US cable channel that acquired the rights. “They wanted me to be in it, and the same director, and then they wanted other cast members to be in it, and then I was like, ‘Guys, why don’t we go with the show we already made?’ And then they did that, thank goodness,” Thomas says. Thank goodness indeed – because for every Office remake success story, there’s a Kath & Kim disaster prompting the the San Francisco Chronicle to opine that America owes Australia an apology. As it was, Pivot put Thomas’s face on the side of buses in Los Angeles – and when Pivot ceased to be, streaming service Hulu quickly stepped in to take over the broadcast rights. The trailer for Everything’s Gonna Be Okay depicts a funeral scene in which Nicholas’s half-sister Matilda (Kayla Cromer) gives a eulogy. While there have been high-profile comedies led by characters on the autism spectrum – Netflix’s Atypical being the most recent example, and Big Bang Theory the most contested one – Thomas believes this is the first time an actor on the spectrum has taken the role. “Having gone through the casting process of auditioning people who are neurotypical and people who have autism, there was only one choice,” Thomas says. “I went in thinking it was more ethical, and I came out of it thinking, ‘This is just better.’ Kayla gives the character so much more authenticity. “There are heaps of girls with autism who are really great actors. I spoke to a mum who said, ‘My daughter’s really good at acting because she had to learn how to mimic to survive and to study human behaviour to understand how neurotypicals work.’ I found that really interesting.” Thomas was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 28, and he thinks that has given him a small window into people who aren’t neurotypical. “I like people who are really direct and I like outsiders,” he says. Cromer’s character is outspokenly interested in sex, which flies against a stereotype that people with autism tend to be asexual and naive. “I wanted to, like, make autism sexy,” he laughs. “People with autism get horny. Girls generally can get desexualised, and people with disabilities get desexualised. [But] she grew up in a progressive family and would have absorbed all that. Autism is a broad church.” As with season four of Please Like Me, season one of Everything’s Gonna Be Okay starts with a gay make-out scene, something he says has given his “poor mum” cause for concern. “She saw the pilot and she was saying, ‘Don’t you think it might make people turn off?’ I said, ‘If they don’t want to see gay people kissing then I don’t want them watching my show.’ Do you know what I mean? I don’t want to hang out with homophobic people and I don’t want my audience to be homophobic, so I’m happy to put [those scenes] there. They hired me because I’m gay. It’s a plus for them.”  Episode one and two of Everything’s Gonna Be Okay premieres on 17 January on Stan in Australia, and Freeform in the US. "
"‘It’s the greatest party in the world,” declares Edinburgh’s Lord Provost, Frank Ross, opening the three-day Hogmanay festival on 30 December. He may well be right. Thousands of people pour into the city from all over the world to take part in the huge variety of events that mark the new year festival. Christmas celebrations were banned in Scotland between 1640 and 1712, and the day itself was not made a public holiday until 1958 – but new year festivities are deep in the nation’s DNA. This year’s Hogmanay, however, begins under a shadow. Local residents whose homes are inside the central area cordoned off for the huge street party complained that their freedom to host celebrations in their own homes was being compromised. Others muttered about the vast, “tacky” Christmas market that turned Princes Street Gardens into an “end of the pier show”, in a debate framed as the battle for the soul of Edinburgh. Princes Street is festooned in hoardings emblazoned with year’s festival motto “Be Together”, and Ed Bartlam, one of the directors of Underbelly, the festival’s producer, is brooking no dissent. “We find it extraordinary and sad that some people still don’t want to get behind the city and the positivity. The world is watching,” he said. Hogmanay begins with a spectacular torchlit procession – 20,000 people marching along the Royal Mile, accompanied by drummers and pipers. The procession ends in Holyrood Park, where the shape of two figures holding hands was formed by massed ranks of torch bearers. In a year that will see the UK leave the EU, and renewed calls for Scottish independence, perhaps two figures turning their backs on each other might have felt more apt. Dick and Dom get the party going on the 31st. Bairns Afore in Princes Street Gardens pits the two childrens’ TV presenters dressed in Sgt Pepper-style jackets in a kid-friendly DJ battle. Each plays two minutes of a pop song, and the crowd cheer for whose is best. The duo’s dad-dancing, air guitar and lively visuals keeps the energy high on this guilty-pleasures-style set.  Medieval St Giles’ Cathedral celebrates in more sedate style with the first and the final parts of Bach’s Christmas Oratorio and Vivaldi’s Dixit Dominus. The candlelight concert in the beautiful gothic building begins with extra timpani as the first fireworks of the night mark the end of the children’s concert. The cathedral’s choir have a bright and open sound and among a group of strong soloists, many locally born, tenor Liam Bonthrone is a standout. As night draws in, Princes Street fills and the serious partying begins – with three separate music stages, three performing stages, street theatre, a silent disco and a ceilidh. Among the solid crowds are marvels – the giant illuminated polar bear puppets of Remue-Ménage, Gandini Jugglers and Avant Garde Dance. Headlining the Waverley stage, Marc Almond helps to keep the crowd warm with a greatest hits set that moves from Stories of Johnny to Something’s Gotten Hold of My Heart (dedicated to “the late great Gene Pitney” to a cover of Marc Bolan’s Hot Love, to Tainted Love, ending just before midnight with Say Hello (to 2020) Wave Goodbye (to 2019). Mark Ronson, like Almond, keeps chat to a minimum. His two-hour set sees the new year in and ends with a tribute to and celebration of “one of the decade’s greatest singers” – Amy Winehouse and her Back to Black (with Ronson on keyboards) and then Valerie. “I was so nervous,” he admits, “[but] this has been one of my best new year’s ever.” The next day, 1,000 intrepid (or unhinged?) souls welcome 2020 by donning fancy dress and jumping into the sea at South Queensferry for the charity fundraising Loony Dook swim. It’s a cold but glorious way to celebrate British warm-hearted eccentricity – and that’s just the spectators, although apparently at 7C with little wind conditions are relatively mild. A pair of Mr Blobbys, dragons, three blind mice, superheroes, elves and unicorns take the plunge, but the Trump Baby has several false starts before he, too, finally dips a toe in, to cheers and boos. The festival, enjoyed by 70,000 people, winds up on New Year’s evening with folk singer Eddi Reader at McEwan Hall. The warmth of her voice and personality radiate in a generous set whose chat is as engaging as the songs. Her stories range from the Book of Kells to her mouse problem, to tales of her family – her uncle who had to take his false teeth out before he started singing, and St Elvis of Presley, who her father prayed to over 30 years ago to get her to No 1 when she was a young singer in Fairground Attraction. Robbie Burns features strongly, and she dedicates her 2014 track Pray the Devil Back to Hell to that “half Scottish boy, Donald Trump” before wishing us 2020 vision in 2020."
"Steve Coogan is shining a light on gender politics after the rise of the #MeToo movement in a new Channel 4 comedy drama in which he plays a successful “ladies’ man” film producer who has to reshoot his sexist film in order to save his career.  Chivalry looks at the changing nature of the film industry after the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, in the form of an unlikely attraction between Coogan’s character, Cameron, and a liberal director called Bobby played by Sarah Solemani. After Bobby is promised funding by a studio for her feminist biblical feature if she helps rescue Cameron’s sexually controversial thriller, the pair forge an unlikely partnership as they bid to detoxify the film and negotiate their “gender tensions”. Billed as a satire about “the complex state of contemporary sexual politics”, Channel 4 said the six-part series asked “how fluid are our politics and how political are our fluids? Can romance blossom – not in spite of #MeToo, but because of it?” Solemani said it was a timely comedy and that Chivalry “was born through a series of fiery debates with my comedy hero and renowned feminist, Steve Coogan”. The pair worked together recently on Michael Winterbottom’s Greed, which was inspired by fashion mogul Sir Philip Green. Coogan said: “I am delighted to be working with the very funny, clever Sarah Solemani in the landscape of what in less enlightened times was called ‘the battle of the sexes’. Chivalry is more of a painfully honest, funny fencing match. We will attack, riposte, lunge, parry and counter-parry and perhaps, when the bout is over, take off our masks revealing our true selves.” It is not the first time Coogan has taken on characters brought up short by the #MeToo era. His veteran character Alan Partridge recently returned to the BBC and was shown floundering as he tried to prove he had become more enlightened. In Greed he played Sir Richard McCreadie, the powerful owner of a string of fast-fashion brands. Ian Katz, Channel 4’s director of programmes, said: “It would be hard to think of a better double act to explore the charged territory of gender politics in a post-#MeToo world than Solemani and Coogan. Their script is timely, human and laugh-out-loud funny.” Coogan’s production company, Baby Cow, will make the series and it will be produced by its CEO, Christine Langan, whose credits include Oscar-winning drama The Queen. Although Chivalry is not based on Weinstein, its premise deals with the consequences for the film industry in light of the allegations of sexual misconduct made against him by more than 80 women. Weinstein’s criminal trial is taking place in New York and he has pleaded not guilty to charges that he sexually assaulted two women. He has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex."
"Once in a generation, a musical becomes a cultural phenomenon. When Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton landed in New York, it joined the story-focused Oklahoma, the rock opera Hair, the highbrow, complicated Company and, yes, even the box office-smashing spectacle of Cats in breaking the form open and changing its course. Hamilton, with its revisionist history, contemporary storytelling and referential hip-hop score quickly became a milestone genre work – and just a few years later, musical theatre creators are already taking a leaf out of its book. Six, the West End hit whose Australian production opened in Sydney last night – a month ahead of the show’s upcoming Broadway debut – is one of the first true post-Hamilton musicals. Only this time the reclamation of history is for the women we’ve dismissed, or judged as villains. The musical comes in a decade which has seen Monica Lewinsky, Lorena Bobbitt and Marcia Clark each seize and reframe their own stories, but in Six we go back 500 years further, as the wives of Henry VIII take the floor. Their marriages were bloody, messy, church-reforming, and pored over by gossipy historians – but this time they’re telling their stories, their way: with a live performance contest starring the hottest pop ghost-girl group you’ve ever seen. They are Fifth Harmony, sure – singing together with tight sounds and tighter choreography – but all six are also that group’s breakout star Normani: when each get their moment to take the spotlight and go solo, the audience just about loses their minds. And like Hamilton’s deep cut homages to R&B artists (and Normani’s, for that matter), they do it by remixing, referencing and shouting out the women of pop. Come for the Spice Girls easter eggs, stay for the Geensleeves ones. Written by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss – who have also written for Australia’s pre-eminent singing drag queen Courtney Act – Six takes the proto-feminism of Hamilton’s women along with the populist feminism of the 2010s, and folds them into a bright, short and snappy musical revue that sees the Queens go from competing with to supporting one another. This happens via often funny and occasionally moving musical numbers that are drenched with a love for pure pop, royal history, and giving women their due. The show is a viral hit with musical theatre’s young fanbase – it’s the second-most streamed cast album in the world – and in Sydney, at the Opera House no less, that bright musical theatre-pop still manages to sound cool. We can thank the band for that – led by musical director Claire Healy on keys, with Ali Foster on drums, Debbie Yap on guitar, and Jessica Dunn on bass – who find the dirty, hot fun in the score and elevate it. Tim Deiling’s lighting is explosively colourful, and Gabriella Slade’s costumes, which remix Tudor finery into sequinned performance gear, are a delight. But you come for the Queens, and these queens do not disappoint. Like the musical version of Alexander Hamilton himself, who is Eminem-meets-Sweeney Todd, each of the ex-wives embody a couple of modern “Queenspirations”: Catherine of Aragon (with nods at Beyonce and Shakira) is played by Chloé Zuel, who moves and sounds like a pop princess; Kala Gare is Anne Boleyn (Lily Allen and Avril Lavigne), with the kind of star power and cheek that should propel her to more major musical stages; Loren Hunter plays Jane Seymour (Adele and Sia), whose lovely ballad lands just right; Anne of Cleves (Nicki Minaj and Rihanna) is played by Kiana Daniele, a new performer with killer stage presence who just about walks off with the show; Courtney Monsma plays Katherine Howard (Ariana Grande and Britney Spears), and gracefully moves from blithe to dark in one short song; and Catherine Parr (Alicia Keys and Emeli Sande) is played by Vidya Makan, who blows the roof off with stunning vocals and – crucially – carries the show into a denouement that could, in less confident hands, feel far too treacly. Six is constantly at risk of sliding into syrup: its feminist message is the lightest and most easily consumable one possible, some of the lyrics and lines are a little heavy handed, and the whole thing is so music-forward that the brief dialogue scenes threaten its collapse. But under international associate director Grace Taylor and Australian associate director Sharon Millerchip, the performers know when to lean into the charm and when to modulate into something softer. Musicals aren’t always kind to women (some classics are downright misogynist), but Six is a joyous celebration of sisterhood. It’s the kind of show that makes you want to be a teenager again; if you’d found Six when you were sixteen, you’d be obsessed too. No wonder it’s getting 60,000 streams per day."
"(Sam Mendes, 2019, UK/US) 119 mins Having scooped two – somewhat unexpected – Golden Globe awards, Sam Mendes’s first world war drama is now set fair for a major assault on the Oscars. Spun out (with writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns) from a story Mendes heard from his grandfather, 1917 follows two soldiers as they head across no man’s land to deliver a vital message. An immersive tour de force of apparently unbroken takes. (Josh and Benny Safdie, 2019, US) 135 mins Adam Sandler turns in a dynamic, brilliant performance in Uncut Gems as gem-dealing hustler Howard Ratner, selling jewels as he tries to pay off the loan sharks. The Safdie brothers (of Good Time renown) direct at a hundred miles an hour; their frenetic style bringing out the best in Sandler, who is leagues ahead of his more customary gormless comedy persona. (Benedict Andrews, 2019, UK/US) 102 mins Here is a real Hollywood tragedy: Jean Seberg, the elfin, pixie-cropped star of Saint Joan and Breathless, who rattled the FBI’s cage by getting involved with the Black Panthers, ending up on the receiving end of a Cointelpro anti-subversion operation. Kristen Stewart, who knows a thing or two about being the subject of unwelcome intrusion, plays Seberg, the immaculately tailored exponent of radical chic. (Greta Gerwig, 2019, US) 135 mins Greta Gerwig has made a major step up from Lady Bird: taking on a beloved, all-time classic is never easy. And she’s very much cracked it with Little Women, scoring a decent commercial return as well as rave reviews across the board (notwithstanding a small-scale rumpus over a male/female divide in its audience). Even if the Golden Globes failed to notice her, she’s got every chance of an Oscar nomination this week. (Alejandro Jodorowsky, 1970, Mex) 124 mins One of the more berserk products of the counter-culture era, El Topo is directed by and stars Chilean film-maker Alejandro Jodorowsky (who would complete one more film, The Holy Mountain, before effectively disappearing for a decade and a half). Jodorowsky plays a black-clad gunslinger seeking mystical insights: after shooting down a series of symbolic opponents he ends up in a cave with a tribe of outcasts. It may not make sense, but who cares? AP Time has not mellowed Slipknot, thankfully, and the nu-metal troupe will not be making a comeback with nice new haircuts for an all-acoustic tour. No, instead, the Iowa shouters return in full gimp-masked splendour to offer the terrifying sounds of new album We Are Not Your Kind – an “art record”, according to percussionist Shawn “Clown” Crahan. Good times! Dublin, Tuesday 14; Manchester, Thursday 16; Newcastle upon Tyne, Friday 17; touring to 25 January Dismayed at being back in the grips of the working week again? Relieve corporate gloom at this annual festival from music website The Line of Best Fit, which runs on weekday evenings. Tip-top talent includes sweet-voiced US singer-songwriter Frances Quinlan, dreamy Irish combo Just Mustard and winsome Philly outfit the Districts. The Lexington, N1, Monday 13 to Friday 17 January The a-ha of K-pop, hit-making Korean combo Day6 are that rarest of beasts: a boyband whose pouty members write their own songs and perform them, on actual instruments. The result is the kind of sunny power-pop that might occur if Green Day started covering ELO songs (in Korean, obviously). Extra points for song titles including Lovely Girl, Hi Hello and I Like You. 02 Academy Brixton, SW9, Sunday 12 January Seattle pop troubadour Noah Gundersen got an early break in 2013 with a track featured on The Vampire Diaries, the perfect showcase for his growly, polished sound. But he’s at his best stripped right back, as on 2018’s collab with Phoebe Bridgers, Killer + the Sound. This tour offers fittingly intimate settings for songs from Gundersen’s last LP, the super-sincere Lover. Union Chapel, N1, Thursday 16; Gorilla, Manchester, Friday 17; touring to 20 January SH Tel Aviv-born bassist and composer Liran Donin is a cornerstone of former Mercury-nominated sax-blasters Led Bib, but his own folk-jazzy 1000 Boats band reveals imaginatively different dimensions to his work. The soundworlds of Hermeto Pascoal, fellow bassist Avishai Cohen, Carla Bley and uninhibited free-jazz meet in this kaleidoscopically lyrical group. The Lescar, Sheffield, Wednesday 15; 1000 Trades, Birmingham, Friday 17 January JF Musically, 2020 is going to be dominated by events marking the 250th anniversary of Beethoven’s birth. The BBC Symphony Orchestra, along with the BBC Singers, get their tribute under way with the European premiere of a concert opera by David Lang that updates the story of Beethoven’s only opera, Fidelio, to the present day. It stars Claron McFadden and the staging is directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer; Ilan Volkov conducts. Barbican Hall, EC2, Saturday 12 January Two premieres and a rarely heard 19th-century symphony linked by their Scottish associations make up the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra’s first concert of the year, conducted by Thomas Dausgaard. Bent Sørensen’s Enchantress: 5 Intermezzi for Orchestra takes its title from a poem by Walter Scott, while The Sail of a Flame, Emma-Ruth Richards’s song cycle for mezzo-soprano and orchestra, sets texts by modern Scottish poets. The revival is the Gaelic Symphony by Amy Beach, based on Scottish, Irish and English folk tunes. City Halls, Glasgow, Saturday 12 January This year sees the centenary of the birth of Ravi Shankar, and the London Philharmonic are marking the anniversary with a revival of their 2017 semi-staging of the composer-sitarist’s only opera. Based upon a story from the Mahabharata, Sukanya is scored for Indian and western instruments, and involves dancers as well as singers; David Murphy conducts the performance, which is directed by Suba Das and choreographed by Gauri Diwakar, with Susanna Hurrell in the title role. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Wednesday AC The great Adam Chodzko is among the participants in this group show. Chodzko’s disconcerting interventions on the border of art and life (Fluid Dynamics; The Raising of the Quail, pictured) are always worth investigating. Other good artists here include Ayo Akingbade, Rebecca Lennon, Patrick Goddard, Melanie Smith and Webb-Ellis.Tintype Gallery, N1, to 9 February The London Arts Board sounds authoritative but it’s just an old billboard on a Camberwell street corner where upcoming artists create public projects. Seungwon Jung’s is about the nature of time. She uses the imagery of geological strata, layers of rock that reveal millions of years of time, to explore the “deep time” of memory. London Arts Board, SE5, to 2 February So much that passes for contemporary art is smooth, smart and completely forgettable. Damien Hirst is a monster in this mainstream, as hated by cool arty people as he is by any traditionalists who may survive. And that’s why he matters. His giant bronze sculptures stick out like sore thumbs on this sculpture park’s rolling hills – luridly painted lifelike statues that are both ugly and compelling. Yorkshire Sculpture Park, near Wakefield, to 1 April 2022 Fantasies of intelligent and mobile machines have stalked the modern imagination from Fritz Lang’s Metropolis to The Terminator and beyond. But are our robot dreams – and nightmares – becoming real? This exhibition mixes the latest strides in robotics with the rich legacy of science fiction to explore the boundaries of technology. The Star Wars droids make a timely guest appearance. But are their real-world cousins as characterful? V&A Dundee, to 9 February Food has obsessed painters ever since ancient Greek artists competed to fool birds into pecking their pictures of fruit. But the painting of food reached its apogee in the 17th century when Caravaggio’s black grapes pointed the way to richly real displays of Dutch cheeses, beer and lobsters and Spanish celery and meat. This show surveys a truly delicious theme from 1500 to 1800. Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, to 26 April JJ One of the first big-hitters of the theatrical year arrives and it’s set to be a cracker. This adaptation is penned by Conor McPherson, whom you can always depend on to create something special. A stunning cast includes Toby Jones (always an enigma) in the title role, plus Richard Armitage (always powerful) and Ciarán Hinds (always devastating). Directed by Ian Rickson. The Harold Pinter Theatre, SW1, Tuesday 14 January to 2 May Director Robert Hastie has created a sparkling new take on Frank Loesser’s musical about seductive sinner Sky Masterston and the woman who might just save his soul. The whole cast is clearly having a ball but Natalie Casey (pictured) and Martin Marquez steal the show as long-time lovers (and squabblers) Miss Adelaide and Nathan Detroit. Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, to 18 January Miriam Battye has been steadily making a name for herself with intriguing plays for the National Youth Theatre and Manchester’s Royal Exchange. Her latest drama is about close friends Tosh and Lou who’ve grown up together – just the two of them (and their own special language) against the world. What future do they imagine for themselves? Lucy Morrison directs Rebekah Murrell, Tanya Reynolds and Letty Thomas. Royal Court, SW1, Wednesday 15 January to 22 February It’s your last chance to see Nikolai Foster’s bold take on Leonard Bernstein’s masterful musical. Even the most innovative shows can end up being predictable but this West Side Story feels timely and new. There’s original choreography from Ellen Kane, and a real sense of danger and spontaneity underpins all those clicks and high kicks. Romantic leads Adriana Ivelisse and Jamie Muscato make sure this Romeo and Juliet-inspired musical is still shot through with tenderness. Curve Theatre, Leicester, to 18 January This is quite a coup for fringe theatre Jermyn Street. Trevor Nunn is directing a triple bill of Beckett plays: Krapp’s Last Tape, Eh Joe and The Old Tune. The big-hitting cast features Niall Buggy, James Hayes, David Threlfall and Beckett actor extraordinaire Lisa Dwan. It’s a rare chance to see these special and haunting plays all in one go, and they should feel particularly intense in this intimate venue. Jermyn Street Theatre, SW1, Wednesday 15 January to 8 February MG Originally called the London Festival Ballet, ENB celebrates its 70th birthday – looking pretty spry for 70, you have to say – with a feast of dance nuggets from down the years. There’ll be extracts from ballets by George Balanchine, Rudolf Nureyev, Roland Petit, William Forsythe, Akram Khan and more. London Coliseum, WC2, Friday 17 & 18 January London international mime festival always throws up unexpected oddball delights and Jonathan Guichard’s 3D could be one of them. An acrobat and wire-walker, Guichard’s intimate show is based on a specially constructed piece of circus equipment that looks like a giant longbow. Jacksons Lane, N6, Saturday 11 & Sunday 12 January For when you’re having withdrawal symptoms from the dazzling smiles, unerring positivity and ballroom dance-based bonding that is Strictly, the live tour comes to the rescue. The 2018 winner Stacey Dooley hosts all your faves. Arena Birmingham, Thursday 16 to 19 January; touring to 9 February LW"
"Nature is reinventing this wedge of land between the railway and the River Derwent, once a small coalyard. A half century of quiet work has created a skim of gritty black soil and in early summer the place is a riot of floral colour. In winter, though, it’s the buildings that draw me. There was once a row of cottages here, of which I can find no physical sign, and the idea of them flickering at the edge of living memory troubles me. Still present, however, is the little stone hut next to the pit where coal was weighed. The slate roof is giving way and sprouting with hart’s tongue fern. The door sags half open and inside is an odd assemblage, co-curated by forgotten intentions, mischief, nature and neglect. A rotting blanket at the window, the rusting ironwork of the old weighing apparatus, a half dozen empty plastic carboys, a scorched tennis racket. I glimpse bits of myself on the floor in shards of broken mirror. On one wall the name “Colin” is daubed in blue paint. Another has pencil scribblings: names, dates, a drawing labelled “Mr Vause”, and an odd little rant: “TRIPE TRIPE TRIPE TRIPE TR … Bad, bad”. Vause was the name of the owners of the coalyard business in the 1950s. The fireplace has an iron surround but no mantelshelf; still, it’s a hearth, and hearths tug on a part of my mind that is far older than I am. I crouch at the broken grate and someone long ago becomes present, strikes a match, and we wait together for the glow and flare, hold out our hands and flex them to dislodge the chill, thinking about a nice hot brew. It’s cosy, this little seance in my head, until I realise that there’s nothing in it for him other than a premonition of ruin. The thought of scrutiny from the future is an uneasy one and it’s still in my mind when I drop my gaze to the floor, and almost yelp because there are eyes there: blue, unblinking and furious. They are only the spots on the dismembered wings of a peacock butterfly, but I feel their glare long after I leave."
"British historian Hallie Rubenhold is the author of The Five, a social history of the women murdered by Jack the Ripper, which won the 2019 Baillie Gifford prize and is out now in paperback (Black Swan, £9.99). Born in Los Angeles, she studied history in the US before attending the University of Leeds. Her 2005 book The Covent Garden Ladies, about a notorious guidebook to Georgian prostitutes, inspired the TV series Harlots, while her next book, The Scandalous Lady W, was adapted into a BBC drama. Rubenhold lives in London with her husband.  In the two-and-a-half weeks it took me to ravenously consume both seasons of this masterly series of Shakespearean proportions, I wouldn’t shut up about it. The writing and the characters possessed me. When I wasn’t in front of the TV, I was lost in my thoughts about the Roys, weighing up their deficits against the small deeds that occasionally redeemed them. The fictional story of this all-mighty, super-rich family is such a universal one throughout history – they could be the Borgias or the Gettys. Cousin Greg, the poor, backward relation come to seek his fortune, and Tom, the bourgeois fiance desperate to impress the patriarch, play like two characters from a Restoration comedy. It’s utterly brilliant. In November, I had the life-enriching experience of visiting Peru with the Hay festival and the British Council. I found Lima, with its mix of Spanish and Chinese cultural influences and its pile of Inca ruins at the heart of the city, more fascinating than I could have imagined. Having grown up in LA, I often pine for the warm, salty Pacific and the cool morning fogs of spring. Lima obligingly delivered this, along with some fabulous ceviche. I was sent back to London with a newly acquired pisco sour habit, a detailed knowledge of alpaca wool production and some wonderful memories. I have fairly eclectic and esoteric taste in books. Quite a lot of what is on my e-reader is out of print and deeply unfashionable; obscure 18th-century autobiographies and extended pieces of Victorian journalism. On my bedside table I have a book about women who participated in the California gold rush next to a cookery book from a restaurant in Dingle. This is why Thames and Hudson’s large, colourful reprint of Charles Booth’s poverty maps spoke to me. I am an incorrigible history nerd and this volume reproduces some of the social reformer’s work charting poverty along London’s late Victorian streets. The book also includes some fascinating photos of street life, as well as contributions from modern historians exploring the experiences of the urban poor. At the age of seven, I was taken to see the touring exhibition of Tutankhamun’s treasures at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. This experience prompted me to write a play about the boy-pharaoh’s life which was then performed by my primary school. I suppose this was my first foray into the world of “public history”. Now that the exhibition is back and on my doorstep, I’m really looking forward to revisiting these artefacts and examining them with the eye of a fully fledged historian. Everything about Coal Office is a feat of design, from Tom Dixon’s cutlery to the rough-textured, urban chic interiors. It’s a painfully cool place in King’s Cross, that hip new corridor of coolness. The food, served up by Assaf Granit (of the Palomar) is a perfect piece of heaven. They call it “modern Mediterranean”, but it travels a bit further afield creatively than that. Anyone who thinks the humble beetroot isn’t capable of inspiring rapture hasn’t tried From Russia With Love, one of their signature dishes. I have a particular weakness for corporate dramas. So many egos and conflicting ambitions sealed into a workspace creates a type of electric tension. When you throw a whistleblower into the mix, the environment can become explosive. I enjoyed watching three merciless women, Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and the fictional Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) take down Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), the former head of Fox News. His abuse of female employees was appalling, but the film also depicted an equally vile workplace culture at Fox which pitted women against one another. Watching them attempt to correct these wrongs while adamantly refusing to be labelled feminists… it was quite a feat of rightwing gymnastics. All three female leads put in stunning performances."
"If the question, “Will Jerry make mat?” requires no explanation, then you are already familiar with the intense but insanely compelling six-part docuseries that is Cheer. You know the revered coach Monica Aldama, are familiar with her trademark boots, her mild temperament and amused grins that say nothing about her competitive, perfectionist spirit. The words “tumbling” and “baskets” have gained new meaning, and you watched, anxious, as the Navarro College Bulldogs Cheer Team competed for another title at the annual National Cheerleading Championship in Daytona, Florida. I say “another” because in Cheer, the team is not chasing its first win. They have triumphed many times under Monica, who takes them under her wing with a business mind and the attitude of a maternal saviour. The cheerleaders are seeking personal triumphs, but they also really, really want to win for Monica. Cheerleading remains linked to the yesteryear image of pompoms and short skirts, but this is not that kind of cheerleading. Youthful and optimistic (smile, always!), this is cirque du insanity, with deafening “mat talk” (cheering on teammates) and death-defying tumbles and flips. These athletes do things most humans cannot do. Arguably, they do things most humans should not attempt. Your classic Hollywood athletic film is generally about a highly skilled coach leading players with potential to victory – and very importantly, fostering transformation, inner strength and self-worth. In a similar vein, Navarro’s team is composed of talented athletes but some are not great – yet. They get in because they have the look or potential Monica seeks. On the mat are well-built male athletes, literally holding up female cheerleaders who are cute and petite. Monica beams when they’re in uniform, unnervingly dolled up like they’re headed to a beauty pageant to comment on prospects for world peace. Meanwhile, the mixed-race team resides in a small, conservative, Trump-sympathetic town in Texas called Corsicana, previously known more for its fruit cake than its trophy-magnet cheer team. (Seriously.) You don’t need to like a sport to partake in its world (see: the documentary about the Chicago Bulls, The Last Dance). Cheer is that kind of story, supported heavily by high stakes and those individual tales of painful transformation. And while it’s southern Americana, it will suck you in to an astounding microverse populated by motivated people doing unnatural things to their bodies in order to succeed. It’s cheerleading but with much higher stakes than Bring It On. Indeed, race relations take a back row to the individual journeys featured. These personal stories are a strength, documenting not only current challenges but the personal tragedies that have led them to this point. There’s Jerry, who is kind, supportive and arguably every viewer’s favourite, but he has limited capabilities as a cheerleader. All we want is to see him “make mat”, which means make the cut for Daytona. There’s gum-chewing Morgan, whose devotion to Monica is equalled only by her dedication to practise. When she returns from a hospital visit with a warning that she shouldn’t continue practising in case she, like, punctures an organ, she shrugs it off. You can get by on one kidney, right? There’s Gabi, a sweet and highly regarded but also Instagram-famous cheerleader who must navigate the demands on her time – including an overbearing family. Then there’s La’Darius, a proficient but troubled performer who hovers between greatness and self-sabotage. He went viral long before Cheer dropped for his playful “groove” at a game. While I query the price of competitive sport, I can also see its appeal. Creative energy needs somewhere to go. We need ways to work through what we can’t control, to dim the past and find new emotional outlets. And doing so in a team can be both challenging and rewarding, as Cheer dutifully shows us. So I wager it would be difficult to watch Cheer and not find yourself absorbed by the trials and triumphs of college athletics and what it says about the human spirit. And let’s be honest: who doesn’t wish, even briefly, that they could be tossed into the air knowing someone will be there to catch them?"

"Two months into the coronavirus shutdown and America’s numbers are grim, Seth Meyers reported on Wednesday’s Late Night. More than 80,000 people have died in the US, and unemployment is at the highest rate since the Great Depression. On Tuesday, the country’s leading infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, warned Congress that reopening the US too soon could lead to “needless suffering and death”. And yet, “instead of taking that danger seriously and correcting his mistakes, the porridge-brained adult toddler who’s in charge of keeping us all safe has spent the last few days obsessively rage-tweeting vague conspiracies about his predecessor,” said Meyers. This weekend, Donald Trump tweeted, apropos of nothing, “OBAMAGATE”, and when asked to explain what, exactly, Barack Obama did, he told reporters: “You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody.” “No, we don’t. And apparently never do you,” Meyers replied. “Trump’s so lazy he can’t even be bothered to come up with the details of his own fake scandal any more. “Amid a horrific public health emergency that most voters agree he’s basically mishandled, the president is looking to prosecute his political opponents and elevate himself above the law,” Meyers added. “That’s because he knows the coronavirus pandemic and the cratering economy threaten his political survival. So he and his allies on state TV are casting about for anyone else to blame and now they’re obsessing, as they have for years, over Obama.” Meyers played a montage of Fox News hosts including Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham picking up Trump’s lead this week and casting bogus blame on the former president. “Fox hosts say the word Obama like it’s their safe word,” Meyers said. “Their obsession with Obama is akin to gossipy cheerleaders spreading rumors about the prom queen because they’re mad she won’t hang out with them.” The pivot to Obama above all else demonstrates, Meyers concluded, how Republicans and Fox News would rather “live in an alternate universe where Obama was president and not Trump, because then they could at least lie and tell themselves they were a ragtag band of rebels instead of the marketing department for the Death Star”. Celebrating his birthday in quarantine on Wednesday (“Today I turned more at risk”), Stephen Colbert assessed the state of America’s coronavirus pandemic: “We’re all gonna have to get used to celebrating major holidays in a quarantine because this pandemic appears to be making itself comfortable.” Broadway announced this week that it will be closed until at least Labor Day. Cal State University canceled in-person classes for the fall. “Nobody likes that we have to do this,” said Colbert, “but we have to do this, according to health professionals” like Fauci, who warned a Senate panel on Tuesday on the risks of reopening too soon. Fauci’s warning received pushback from some Republican senators seeking to reopen the country immediately. “Republicans are desperate to reopen the economy because if they don’t, they’ll have to do the unthinkable: give money to someone other than rich people,” Colbert explained. Despite having about 4% of the world’s population, the US has over 25% of the cases and fatalities, Colbert pointed out, “yet Trump can’t stop patting himself on the back.” On Monday, he told reporters he’s “proud” of America’s death rate per 1,000 people, “perhaps the most important number”, which he compared to Germany’s. “Oh, here’s another important number: 100%, which is how much of that he just yanked out of his keister,” Colbert interjected. “In fact, according to Johns Hopkins, in per capita death rate, the US ranks ninth highest out of 140 countries. The United States has a worse record than such medical powerhouses as Moldova! “Our government’s response has been so bad,” Colbert added, that Americans probably won’t be allowed to visit Europe anytime soon. Although, as Colbert pointed out, “forget Europe! At this point I’d settle for a trip to the International House of Pancakes.” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah assessed the impact of the pandemic on the global drug trade. In the US, sales and delivery of legal cannabis have soared. “I don’t think I will ever get used to how much the weed game has changed,” said Noah. “Because it used to be some shady dude on the corner. Now, it’s the lady who used to bring orange slices for everyone at half-time. “You know, it’s going to be real awkward when all those weed dealers who got incarcerated come back home to find their street corners got gentrified,” he said, calling it “Karen’s corner now”. Legal weed aside, the illegal drug trade around the world has struggled, “because it’s a lot harder to hand people drugs when nobody’s supposed to be touching”, Noah explained, pointing to news clips of drug dealers getting creative with their appearances as joggers or pizza delivery guys. The international drug trade has also collapsed on several levels, from supply to manufacturing, and in its place, several former drug networks have become supply chains for families in need, at least according to news from Noah’s native South Africa, where gang members were delivering food to families in need. “I don’t know, man – these gangs might want to be careful delivering groceries and hand sanitizer, ’cause that’s Amazon’s turf,” said Noah. “You guys think you’re tough? Wait until you meet Jeff Bezos. A month from now, the Sinaloa cartel is gonna be the Sinaloa Amazon fulfillment center – and there’s no benefits!”"
"Late-night hosts criticised Trump’s plan to restart the economy too soon and addressed some of the Covid-19 conspiracy theories circulating. On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host started with pictures of the protest in Michigan where angry citizens, many of them wearing Trump hats, expressed displeasure over the lockdown. “The real problem is you can’t make Americans do anything,” Kimmel said. “We just won’t. We only exist because someone tried to make us pay extra for tea once.” Trump has also been talking about reopening businesses within weeks. “He is determined to reopen this country like a bankrupt casino,” he quipped. But after claiming he had total authority over the states, he is now allowing governors to decide when to end enforced quarantining. “In three days he went from ‘I call the shots’ to ‘You do you’,” he joked. Trump has unveiled a plan, which Kimmel summarised. “Phase one: open the golf courses,” he said. “Phase two: open hotels that rhyme with Hump. And number three: all restaurants that serve food in buckets or in the form of nuggets are good to go.” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert mentioned that 22 million Americans have lost their jobs since the pandemic started and “unfortunately Donald Trump is not one of them”. He spoke about Trump holding “another coronavirus blame-and-shout” where he spoke about guidelines for reopening the economy. He listed a number of figures who would be part of a council to figure out the specifics yet many of them were only made aware of their inclusion when he said their names on TV. “Why start asking for consent now?” Colbert joked. He continued: “That’s kind of like finding out you’re engaged by getting a save the date card to your own wedding.” Colbert also joked that Trump is “at least halfway to dictator because he is being a dick” before mentioning a resurfaced plan that suggested Trump wanted to host a daily two-hour radio show from the White House. “Could we just lock him in a soundproof room for two hours a day and just tell him he’s on the radio?” he joked. He also spoke about the recent protests, such as one that aimed to gridlock the streets. “Who are you gridlocking? There’s nobody else out there,” he said. He added: “Nothing says never surrender like a Confederate flag.” On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah posed a question many people have been asking: “Where in the hell did this disease come from?” He then went through some of the theories that have been circulating, including one that suggested it was from bat soup in Wuhan, “a theory people were willing to accept because of racism”. But after that was debunked he moved on to another, pushed by Roseanne Barr, that it was manmade to get rid of old people. “As soon as people started saying ‘OK boomer’ all of a sudden we’ve got coronavirus and old people are dying? That can’t be a coincidence!” he joked. Noah added: “Maybe it’s because someone was tired of giving up their seat on the bus?” But after that was also debunked he addressed the theory that 5G was at fault, a “ridiculous and biologically impossible” idea. “Saying 5G made you sick is sort of like saying an iPhone flashlight gave you sunburn,” he said."
"Phoebe Waller-Bridge had two TV series premiere in 2016: Fleabag and Crashing. One saw her showered in Emmys and Baftas and Golden Globes. It established the British playwright and Fringe favourite as a Hollywood heavy hitter. The other … you probably haven’t heard of before now. Crashing only had one season and it never got great exposure in Australia. But the short, bingeable show is now on Netflix and, with a week-long wait between new episodes of Killing Eve, this is a perfect time for PWB fans to catch up. Crashing follows a group of twentysomethings who live in a disused London hospital as property guardians: an arrangement that allows people to cheaply rent empty and often dilapidated buildings. They’re “not squatters”, as Kate, the most uptight resident, likes to defensively remind everyone. The series opens as ukulele-playing free spirit Lulu (Waller-Bridge) travels to surprise her childhood friend Anthony. Anthony is engaged to Kate: a woman who looks a lot like Lulu but is her exact opposite. She’s kind, but “anal” and awkward despite her best efforts. The first episode ends with her wielding Lulu’s ukulele, while pouring tequila on the floor and screaming “I’m the fun one!!!” to a group of bewildered partygoers. On the surface, there’s nothing that new or exciting about Crashing. It’s an ensemble comedy about the love and sex lives of a group of mostly white millennials in a big city. I mean, it’s nice to see a realistic portrayal of the depressing London real estate market – on release, Crashing was called “a generation-rent Friends for austerity Britain” – but the appeal of the show is all in Waller-Bridge’s writing. Like Fleabag, Crashing is sharp and darkly funny. It’s bursting with sad and self-conscious people awkwardly grappling for a connection. Colin, a depressed middle-aged divorcee, is taken into the house by Melody, a young French artist who paints his pain. Another property guardian, Sam, struggles to mourn the death of his dad and instead sleazes on to women. When he starts having feelings for a male flatmate, he lashes out with laddish homophobia. This cocktail of sex, grief and deflection is found in Fleabag too – and it’s not the only overlap between the two shows. Kate would definitely get along with Fleabag’s sister, Claire. Lulu, like Fleabag, is a “vulnerable rascal” who’s flailing around with her own issues and often hurting people in the process. And the relationship between Lulu and Anthony has some shades of Hot Priest. Andrew Scott’s priest is a much richer and more satisfying character, but Anthony is Irish and forbidden (albeit not by divine providence). And the sexual tension between Lulu and Anthony is similar too: it’s all smiles and teasing and blunt truths. That alone makes the show worth watching. In the end, it makes sense that it was Fleabag that launched Waller-Bridge’s international career. It’s a more complex creation, and its first season left more space to grow. But Crashing has a familiar, ragged charm that’s comforting right now. At a time when everyone’s grappling for their own connections, it feels like catching up with a fun old friend."
"If there’s one show that should be mandatory viewing right now, it’s Gogglebox Australia. Switch off the never-ending news, forget Tiger King on Netflix and tune into this weekly show instead. Appreciating the importance of community is going to get us through the coronavirus crisis – and this show serves it up in spades. I’m even hoping the prime minister will press those involved in the show to continue beyond the season finale on 29 April: if there was ever an essential job beyond frontline workers in these dark days it’s the one performed by these folks. In truth, I’ve long been a fan of this show. Not initially, of course; the idea of watching other people watching TV seemed absurd – the epitome of pop culture eating itself. But a few seasons back I caught an episode or two and was hooked. Reality TV? This is the real thing. Forget overhyped, overexcited, possibly intoxicated strangers indulging in the worst kinds of human behaviour. This show sees family members, friends and flatmates sitting down together to discuss the big issues of the day: should Celia Pacquola have won Dancing with the Stars over Christian Wilkins? Is $20 really enough to tip a Bondi Rescue lifesaver after he’s rescued you from dangerous surf? And did Kim actually just slap Kourtney on the latest episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians? Reams have been written about the virtues of this show: its depiction of ordinary people from different generations and different demographics coming together to laugh and cry is a delight. It’s won Logies and been nominated for Aactas, has international iterations and some of the “stars” have gone on to greater success. The simple reason is that, whether it’s watching election debates or wildlife documentaries, it demonstrates that what unites us is greater than what divides us. And who among us hasn’t watched Selling Houses Australia and thought, “Gee, Andrew Winter, you’re being rather mean to those poor people with questionable taste just trying to make a buck”? Or winced at some of Shayna Blaze’s decorating choices on the same show? Yet as we all experience discomfort for the sake of the greater good, Gogglebox has never been more important. Last week coronavirus crept into all the corners of the show, with those on screen affected by the crisis just like the rest of us. As Scott Morrison announced stricter social distancing measures, new mother Sarah Marie realised her job as a makeup artist was over for now, while her friend Jad revealed he’d been forced to close down his restaurant. The Silberys, mother Kerry and daughter Isabelle, sang happy birthday to 91-year-old grandmother Emily over Skype because she is isolating for her health and safety. And the always hilarious Holly Dalton threatened to move out because her parents, Matt and Kate, were driving her mad while they were all cooped up together with her sister, Millie. We really are all in this together. Life in lockdown means I’ve made things extra meta: I watched the show along with my family on FaceTime. I haven’t seen them in person for weeks so it was wonderful to share a laugh and snatch conversation in the ad breaks. It was like a throwback to my childhood, where we would sometimes watch TV shows together – although this time there were no arguments about the remote control and the mute button could be used if necessary. This is the very particular joy of watching Gogglebox if you live by yourself – just enough family life to warm the heart without having to deal with the less fun bits on a daily basis. Pity, for example, the three Delpechitra children who have to live with their delightful but cringeworthy father who insists on singing at any given opportunity. There’s one more reason why I would encourage everyone to watch Gogglebox – it guarantees the belly laugh we all need right now. Last week I was reduced to uncontrollable giggles as those on the show collectively gagged, winced and shuddered as they watched Karl Pilkington being introduced to – and yes, finally partaking of – Shivambu on the UK show Sick off It. If the collective “eurgh” at the idea of urine therapy doesn’t bring us together, nothing will."
"The second season of Shrill, which became available on SBS in its entirety in January, picks up right where the first left off: with our heroine, Annie Easton (played by the show’s co-creator and Saturday Night Live mainstay Aidy Bryant), running away from the house of the man who’d been harassing her with nasty comments online. The show is based on the writer Lindy West’s 2016 memoir, Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman. A writer for an alt-weekly that mirrors Seattle’s the Stranger – the publication West wrote for in the early days of her career – Annie was high on the adrenaline of confronting her troll and hurling a pot plant through his window. As she sprinted away with a triumphant smile on her face, his response echoed after her: “You better run, you fat bitch!” The first season, which followed Annie’s journey to accept, love and no longer be defined by her body, was bookended by people calling her these words; in episode one it was a trainer encouraging Annie to sign up for workouts. But with her body acceptance journey seemingly realised, the show needed to take Annie somewhere else. One place it takes her, in the best episode of TV I’ve seen so far this year, is a pastel pink “empowerment conference” called WAHAM: Women Are Having A Moment. Based on events like the Goop summit West covered for the Guardian in 2017, it paints a glaring picture of contemporary and commercialised feminism, where attendees pay thousands of dollars to listen to panels full of people spouting empty catchphrases. In the conference’s thoroughfares they can spend even more: on expensive novelty dildos, makeup to cover their supposedly gross legs, and T-shirts that aren’t available in plus sizes. Annie takes it all in, has a brief and revealing conversation with the conference’s “she-EO” (played by Bryant’s SNL co-star Vanessa Bayer, who has “hate in her eyes through a smile”), and returns to the office struggling to reckon with both the price tag put on self-care, and the ultimate act of self-care she performed for herself in season one when she chose to have an abortion. With its accomplished writing staff, which includes Bryant, West, essayist Samantha Irby and SNL writer Sudi Green, Shrill is a show that seems uniquely positioned to put its characters in situations in which they genuinely need to weigh up, say, feeling disheartened by pink-washed politics and recognising that, for many women outside major cities, this is their only exposure to feminist communities. It also refuses to offer easy answers or tie up stories neatly. Annie’s dopey, disappointing but well-meaning boyfriend, Ryan (Luka Jones), remains in the picture – but with increasingly little to show for it. This season of Shrill copped some criticism for the cycle of their relationship, where he’s unable to step up and be an adult partner for her, and she moves on, believing him when he says he’ll do better next time. A friend echoed a similar frustration to me over text when she binged the series, declaring that Annie is too good for him. But that kind of feels like the point. There’s something incredibly revealing in seeing how, when it comes to romance, fat women are implicitly instructed to receive the bare minimum – and be grateful for it. What plays out between Annie and Ryan on screen is a reflection of reality for a lot of women who look and feel like she does. And after finding confidence in herself throughout season one, this series culminates in her using that confidence to demand better for herself from her partner. Stacked up next to something like The Handmaid’s Tale – another series produced by American streaming service Hulu – Shrill’s concerns seem comparatively minor. The chronicle of one woman in a sort-of bad job with a kinda-shitty boyfriend as she slowly acquires the confidence to see both – and the rest of her life – with more clear-eyed confidence seems tiny and low-stakes in the midst of a global catastrophe. But it’s also intimate and personal, and encourages similar interrogation of the tiny, snowballing injustices we’ve accepted because we feared the repercussions of making a fuss."
"Hidden away on a corner of the internet is a video I have returned to time and time again: a 2013 recording of Young Jean Lee’s play We’re Gonna Die. I’ve been spending time with it again these past few weeks. A short 50 minutes, We’re Gonna Die is about exactly that: the inevitability of what we will all come to face. It’s nothing groundbreaking in its production: it’s a simple, multi-camera filming of a downtown New York gig-theatre show. But perhaps at this time, this is what we need. Just the small beauty of simple things, of heart and soul and humanity before everything else. Lee is one of the world’s most exciting playwrights, and here she distils our great fears about tragedy into the minutiae of the everyday. To do this, she crafts a series of monologues and songs about “really ordinary, comforting things”: stories of tragedy and pain, and the modest ways we get through them. The beauty of theatre has always been in its collective experience of space. As coronavirus has shut down every theatre in Australia, I’ve found what I am grieving most is not the art I won’t see, but the people I won’t share that experience with. As much as we can all connect on the internet to talk about the latest streaming mega-hit, those global conversations can’t replace the unified intake of breath in a theatre. But there is something so tender and precious about We’re Gonna Die that, perhaps, being alone in your home is the perfect context to watch it. Sometimes, all you need are those reminders that things can be bad. That pain isn’t unusual. That tragedy will reach us all. The enormity of what we are facing right now as a global community is unfathomable; but it is just as important to remember and acknowledge the small ways we are hurting, too: the lost sleep, the loved ones across suddenly uncrossable state and national borders, the disappearance of physical touch. We haven’t faced this kind of grief before. But we have faced grief and tragedy, heartache and pain. We have not survived this before. But we have survived everything so far. The pain we are feeling now is still just the normal, everyday parts of being human. Death is coming. Horrible things happen. But when we acknowledge this instead of running from it, we can live our best lives. Lee embraces her audience in this space of pain and uncertainty and tells us: it will be OK. We’re Gonna Die isn’t an anthem for the end of the world. It’s a hymn to the inevitability of hardship and grief and death. To the ultimate mundanity and ordinariness of these events. The times we are living through are in no ways ordinary. And perhaps that is why I feel even more acutely comforted by our more dull, everyday lives existing simultaneously. And they will continue ahead of us forever, until, one day, we die. “I’m gonna die / I’m gonna die someday,” Lee sings. “Then I’ll be gone / And it will be OK … Someone will miss me / Someone will be so sad / And it’ll hurt / It’s gonna hurt so bad.” I always find comfort in Lee’s reminder of our capacity for endurance, and her hope. As a world, we’re in uncharted territory. As individuals we can get through this – because, in smaller but no less real ways, we’ve got through it before."

"First there was This Is England, the movie. Set in 1983 in the UK, it followed a group of young skinheads who become divided by the far-right politics creeping into their subculture. At the centre of it all was 12-year-old Shaun, a semi-autobiographical character based on the director Shane Meadows’ youth. This Is England didn’t do much at the box office but it was enough of a critical success that Meadows was able to revive the cast of characters for a TV spin-off. He made three miniseries to follow the film – This Is England ’86, This Is England ’88 and This Is England ’90 – which charted where that friendship group went next in their lives. Over the years, we see them fall in and out of love, go from skins to Stone Roses-worshipping ravers, endure jobs they hate, burn down their lives and then build them up again. Shaun, the star of the movie, steps back somewhat to become part of a wider ensemble. The series is excellent and while it’s beloved in the UK, it doesn’t seem to have found a huge audience here in Australia. Luckily, though, it and the film are now streaming on Stan (bar This Is England ’90, which is mysteriously absent from the catalogue). You’ll need to start your This Is England journey with the film, but don’t take its mood as an indication of what’s to come in the series. While the movie is sombre and a little bit arthouse, the series is funny and endearing. Which is kind of strange, given the topics it tackles: suicide, rape, abuse, addiction and violence all make up major plotlines. Some scenes are truly harrowing. And yet, nothing I’ve seen on TV has ever moved or delighted me quite like This Is England. There is so much heart and so much to cheer for here – especially the characters, who are complex and flawed and often giant fuck-ups, but also entirely lovable. You truly root for them, especially Woody and Lol, the couple at the centre of the group. Identity, belonging and redemption are the themes the show returns to over and over. But it’s about class, too, and how this largely working-class group of young people forge lives to a backdrop of Thatcher and parents who variously hurt them, let them down or loom as reminders of what they don’t want to become. The world around these characters and the cards they are dealt often seem unjust. But the gang keeps going despite it all – often, it’s the strength of their friendships that pull them through. True to life, there aren’t neat and tidy resolutions for every character. But rewatching This Is England this year, I ended the last episode filled mostly with hope. There’s a strange comfort to watching these characters go through the worst things a person can experience and emerge on the other side. Seeing them find happiness between the bullshit is life-affirming, not depressing. It feels like a testament to human resilience, our ability to adapt and the ways we manage to survive even the cruellest of blows. Things fall apart, everything changes, but the world goes on. Maybe, in these times, we can take it as a reminder: this, too, shall pass."
"While Hollywood has slowly started to embrace a more diverse landscape, inspirational depictions of African Americans prospering remain an unfortunate rarity. This year’s Oscars drove the point home quite clearly, with Cynthia Erivo as the lone black acting nominee, playing runaway slave Harriet Tubman. The same year saw snubs for Lupita Nyong’o in Us and Eddie Murphy in Dolemite is My Name, both playing more contemporary characters with agency. It added credence to the long-held suspicion that in order for a performance by a black actor to break out, there needs to be some form of abuse or subservience to gain recognition. Previous wins by Octavia Spencer in The Help, Lupita Nyong’o in 12 Years A Slave and Mahershala Ali in Green Book highlight this. Yes, these experiences form a majority of the black experience in America – but what does it mean that Hollywood is primarily interested in black characters overburdened with obstacles and adversity? Thankfully, two new works, both on streaming platforms and based on true events, work to combat this trend. The Netflix bio-series Self-Made features Octavia Spencer as haircare entrepreneur Madam CJ Walker and tracks how a black woman became the first self-made female millionaire in a segregated, early-20th-century America. The other is the Apple TV film The Banker, which sees two men become two of the first black bankers in America through clever trickery, astute real estate decisions, and coaching a white man to pose as the face of their business. A common thread linking these two narratives, separated by four decades, is the unique pressures black-owned businesses face in America. Their paths to success and prosperity are neither orthodox nor simple. For Madam CJ Walker and Joe Morris and Barnard Garrett (The Banker’s main characters), making it in America requires not only creativity. There’s also the weighted responsibility of lifting up the entire black community along with you. As Walker exclaims in one scene, pitching her haircare products to a group of black women eager to climb the ladder, “When one of us looks good, we all look good!” Walker was noted for hiring and training more than 20,000 black workers for her company. Morris and Garrett issued scores of loans to black business owners which, in the 60s, were unfairly viewed as “high-risk loans” by white bankers and frequently denied. We’re shown that a black business succeeding results in a black community succeeding too. While Self-Made is not a perfect limited series (the acting of comedian Tiffany Haddish, who plays Walker’s daughter, falls noticeably flat), it strives to illustrate the nuanced hurdles to Walker’s rise. There are scant white characters. So the racism Walker encounters, initially, is internalized within the all-black community she lives in. Back then (and even today), black beauty hair products exalted eurocentric or “mixed” beauty ideals. In the series, Walker’s main competitor is a light-skinned black woman who uses colorism to her financial advantage, telling Walker, who is dark-skinned, “Colored women will do anything to look like me. Even if deep down they know they can’t.” Then there were the black men, like the noted activist Booker T Washington, who refused to see a beauty business as seriously advancing the “negro cause”. The confluence of sexism and racism shines bright. Meanwhile, The Banker’s depiction of black business highlights a common adage within the community – “You have to be twice as good to get half of what they have.” “They” being white people, of course. Barnard Garrett is a gifted businessman able to perform complex calculations in his head while conducting intense contract negotiations. He amasses a small, but substantial, fortune through purchasing properties on the borders of white neighborhoods and leasing them to affluent black renters. But Garrett’s talent for flipping real estate is not good enough. He still encounters white businessmen who are unwilling to take him seriously because of his race in a consciously segregated LA (not a landscape modern viewers may immediately associate with such blatant racism). Garrett’s inability to turn himself into a mogul is not through lack of talent, but lack of opportunity – a reality numerous people of color were, and still are, forced to contend with. While scenes of Garrett and Morris teaching a white handyman (played by Nicholas Hoult) math equations, golfing and the art of fine dining are framed as comedic and lighthearted, prepping him to be their stand-in for business deals, they feel like the manifestation of a deeper, darker reality in America. It’s not just about ideas and talent for black business owners. Black-owned businesses still face serious pressures in America. For one, there’s not a lot of them. In 2012, the Census Bureau reported only 9.7% of business owners were black, compared with 83% being white. This has resulted in “buying black” growing increasingly hard, as explored by Killer Mike in an episode of his Netflix show Trigger Warning. The rapper/activist gave himself the mission of living off only products and services produced by black-owned businesses – which proved nearly impossible. Our current moment lacks a modern Madam CJ Walker, despite the purchasing power of black buyers steadily growing: 70% of beauty hair supply stores catering to black hair types are owned by Asian Americans. Hopefully Hollywood expands on these kinds of narratives, which certainly serve more purpose than a “white savior” plotline such as that of Green Book. They remind me of black-centric films such as the Ice Cube-led, mid-aughts Barbershop franchise and its spinoff Beauty Shop. Narratives that highlight the important work done in black communities and showcase our entrepreneurial spirit. However, those films were produced for and exclusively marketed to black moviegoers. These later works feel nuanced, yet made for a broader audience, suggesting that a major shift in representation of black narratives might be occurring in Hollywood: a move away from trauma and towards success."
"Edinburgh’s five August festivals, which were due to welcome audiences of more than 4.4 million people and 25,000 artists, have in effect been cancelled. The fringe, the world’s biggest arts festival, on Wednesday joined the city’s book, art and international festivals and military tattoo in announcing that the plug was being pulled on preparations for this year Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Fringe Society, said the decision had not been taken lightly. She also held out hope that they would find ways of “uniting people” under a fringe umbrella. “It’s too early to say what this will look like,” she said, “but we are confident that as a collective we can find a way to reach through the walls that currently surround us and inspire, cheer and connect.” McCarthy said registration fees, tickets and memberships would all be refunded. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, described the cancellation as “a heartbreaking decision but the right one” and promised to work with the festivals to ensure that they returned stronger next year. Because the fringe is an open-access event, the governing Fringe Society cannot formally cancel it in the same way other festivals can. But it can recommend that the many venues and participants stop their planning and refund deposits and tickets. No one knows what the UK will be like in August, but it was becoming increasingly clear that the huge, expensive operation going on at the moment to prepare for the fringe could no longer continue. A joint statement to visiting companies and performers from the fringe’s biggest venues, the Assembly, Gilded Balloon, Underbelly and Pleasance, said: “Whilst we are suspending our activity for the foreseeable future, if there is any chance that we might rekindle the spark of a festival fringe at our venues in August 2020 and rebuild an event for this summer, we will certainly try. “The undefinable and indefatigable fringe spirit has always been one of this festival’s most exhilarating characteristics, and if there is any way that we can capture just a tiny ounce of that spirit this summer, then we hope you know we will give it our best shot.” The Summerhall venue had been looking forward to its 10th fringe programme. Rowan Campbell, general manager, said she agreed that “it is neither possible nor desirable for the event to go ahead as planned in August”. The effect on the local economy and wider cultural ecology will be enormous. The fringe last year had record ticket sales of 3m and generated, according to one economic analysis, more than £1bn for the local and wider economy. Among those watching 3,800 shows in more than 300 venues were theatre, film and television bookers and producers looking for latest trends and on the hunt for the next generation of talent. The fringe was born in 1947 after eight companies who had asked to be part of the inaugural Edinburgh international festival were refused entry. They decided to perform anyway, and from that came the annual free-spirited, non-curated blizzard of culture that is open to everyone. Every year visitors see some of the best and worst that the worlds of theatre, comedy and dance have to offer. Its ethos has inspired around 200 fringe festivals around the world, from Melbourne to Montreal to Morecambe. The Edinburgh news had been feeling increasingly inevitable. It joins hundreds of festivals and cultural events already cancelled because of coronavirus, including the Hay literary festival in May, Glastonbury in June, and the Buxton international festival in July. Many performers, while disappointed, will be glad of the clarity. Jordan Brookes, who won the Edinburgh comedy award in 2019, last week tweeted, pleading “for the love of absolute god” for the cancellation of the fringe. The comedian and co-host of BBC Radio 4’s News Quiz, Angela Barnes, said it was a sad decision, but the right one. “Even if we are out of lockdown come August, it’s going to be a big ask for people to be in a mindset where they are happy to be in a dark, sweaty room with strangers from all over the world. “The lockdown is going to cast a longer shadow than just the amount of time we’re in our houses for.” While all five Edinburgh events are to be closed in August, a small independent festival in nearby North Berwick, which times its events to coincide with the Scottish capital’s major festivals, is pressing on with its programme. Jackie Shuttleworth, general manager of Fringe By the Sea, said it would abide by government rulings on social distancing and lockdowns in force at the time but claimed they were small and nimble enough to adapt nearer the time. This year’s event, which runs over 10 days from 7 to 16 August, is due to feature a DJ set with Basement Jaxx, sets by the folk singer KT Tunstall, the comedian Janey Godley and the US singer-songwriter Candi Staton. Its main venues are two tents near the harbour. "

"As any performer or comedian will tell you, timing is everything. The cliché was never more painful than last Friday, when the Australia Council for the Arts handed down the results of its four year funding round for smaller cultural organisations. The results were heartbreaking. Some of Australia’s most important and innovative arts organisations have lost their federal funding: the lifeline that they had counted on to try and ride out these extraordinary times. The list of organisations being “transitioned out” of Australia Council funding includes the Sydney Writers’ festival; many of the nation’s literary magazines, including Australian Book Review, Overland and the Sydney Review of Books, and a long string of theatre and dance companies, such as Sydney’s Australian Theatre for Young People, Adelaide’s Restless Dance Theatre, Perth’s Blue Room and Melbourne’s famous small theatre La Mama. For perennially hard-pressed cultural organisations, funding cuts would be difficult in any climate. Unfortunately for Australia’s small cultural organisations, this is the very worst time of all. The coronavirus outbreak has heralded wrenching changes to all sectors of our economy. But with the possible exception of aviation, no sector has fared worse than culture. This is not a “recession” or a “downturn” by any normal definition. In response to coronavirus, whole sectors of the cultural industries have completely ceased operating. By government fiat, every single performing arts company in the land has shut down in recent weeks. Every festival. Every theatre, opera house and music hall. Every public address or panel of speakers. The majority of art galleries and museums. The arts minister, Paul Fletcher, argues that arts organisations affected by the restrictions can apply for the government’s jobkeeper package – indeed, he wrote in a media release that the stimulus could total billions of dollars across the cultural sector when finally totted up. “Most organisations in the arts sector are expected to meet the eligibility requirement of revenue having fallen by 30% or more, given that performances have been suspended and venues closed,” Fletcher’s statement notes. This is scant consolation for the organisations that lost their funding late last week. The jobkeeper package is not even legislated yet, and there are many questions as to how it might apply. Why would the Australia Council slash arts funding during the worst crisis in Australian culture in a century? The answers are depressingly familiar. The current funding round is the tortuous outcome of years of creeping austerity levelled on the Australia Council by successive Coalition governments. The pain began in Joe Hockey’s first budget of 2014, and was followed by the notorious “Excellence Fund” raid sortied by George Brandis, in which $105 million was ripped out of the Australia Council to pay for a parallel funding program dreamed up by the former arts minister in a flight of vainglory. Some of the excellence funding was eventually returned, but in real terms Australia Council funding has declined by nearly 20% since Labor left office in 2013. To compound matters, most of the Australia Council’s funding is quarantined for a group of larger performing arts companies co-funded with the states and territories, known as the Major Performing Arts organisations. These big companies, such as Opera Australia, the Australian Ballet, and the various state orchestras and theatre companies, soak up three-fifths of the Australia Council’s total budget. There simply isn’t much funding left to go round. The dilemma is made even more painful by the fact the smaller companies (often known as the “small-to-medium” sector) have double the audiences of the majors, and produce around four times as much work each year. However, they get about a quarter of the funding. As a result, the Australia Council has been left in an invidious situation. As a matter of policy, it is not allowed to take money from the major companies. But it doesn’t have the money to fund the small-to-medium sector properly. The inevitable result was Friday’s bloodbath. For a lover of culture, going over the list of who missed out is shocking. Companies of the calibre of La Mama, Australian Theatre for Young People, Polyglot, Liquid Architecture, Australian Book Review, Overland, Information and Cultural Exchange, the Sydney Writers festival, St Martins, Restless Dance Theatre, The Blue Room Theatre, Barking Gekko, the Sydney Review of Books and Ensemble Offspring are some of the most significant cultural organisations in the country. There can be no pretence that they have failed to win funding because they lack merit. They aren’t getting funding because there isn’t enough money. There is enough money to fund Australian culture properly, of course. It’s simply a matter of political will. While the Australia Council’s annual budget is less than $200 million,  the government has announced economic stimulus measures worth nearly $200 billion in recent weeks. Yes, some cultural organisations will benefit from the stimulus measures. But we are now throwing nationally significant arts companies to the wolves. Aren’t there bigger priorities than arts funding in a pandemic, you might ask? Yes, of course there are. Everyone in Australian culture agrees that social distancing is necessary and that the festivals and theatres must shut. No one argues that arts funding should take priority over hospitals. But surely we can now agree that culture matters too. As Benjamin Law pointed out in a perceptive article last week, what are the locked-down citizens of Australia doing in their time of crisis? They are reading, watching Netflix, listening to podcasts, singing and dancing at home. They are making culture. Covid-19 is an opportunity to ask ourselves as a nation why we take our artists and cultural organisations for granted. Why, even in an emergency, can’t we find the money to fund a couple of hundred of the most important arts organisations in the country properly? The answers are both complex, and simple. Historical precedent, conservative antipathy to arts funding, and enduring beliefs that artists are not really deserving and that culture is not a real industry all play a part. But the simpler explanation is a failure of imagination."
"“I think it’s Wednesday,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show from his home in New Jersey. “It’s hard to tell, because every day feels like you’re being humped.” And “while social distancing is working, we know the worst is yet to come,” Colbert said. “It’s like we saw the asteroid come in through the atmosphere and we know that it hit somewhere out in the ocean, and we’re just waiting for the wave to come over the horizon. Well, I think the tide is rising.” On Wednesday, the White House announced they project between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans will die of Covid-19. “And with these devastating projections, it seems like President Trump now understands the gravity of the situation we’re all in.” As in, he called the coronavirus “interesting” at his press conference and mused that people “can’t get enough of it”. “Yes, this pandemic which is crippling the global economy certainly is … interesting,” said Colbert. “It reminds me of Winston Churchill: ‘We shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight them on the landing grounds. Why? Because it’s interesting!’” One leader who is responding well to the crisis? New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has “projected an air of much-needed competence during the epidemic,” said Colbert, “and the people. Are. There. For. It.” The hashtag #presidentcuomo has been trending on Twitter, and a Jezebel op-ed asked “Help, I Think I’m In Love With Andrew Cuomo???” “It’s OK, these feelings are perfectly natural,” joked Colbert. “Many Americans experience moments of being at least Andrew-curious, if not fully Cuomo-sexual.” Colbert noted, however, that the obsession with Cuomo was heading to a “really weird place” – specifically, online chatter about whether or not a photo of the governor indicated pierced nipples. Colbert assessed the evidence and concluded: “Who cares what’s really underneath that polo shirt? The governor’s doing a good job!” On the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah discussed how Trump, “who usually treats his daily briefings like the last scene in Scarface, came out yesterday and acted for the first time ever like he had also been reading the news”. At Wednesday’s press briefing, he struck what many news outlets called a “darker” tone. “God damn, Donald Trump for the first time at least sounds like he’s afraid of this virus,” said Noah. “And if he’s taking it seriously, then we should be really scared. Because I mean, this guy takes nothing seriously. This is the same dude who stared at an eclipse like it was a magic eye painting. The same dude who sang Hakuna Matata when he assassinated an Iranian general. The same dude who responded to a hurricane with a paper towel three-point contest. So this is a side of Donald Trump we don’t often get. I haven’t seen Trump this somber since Maury told him that he was Eric’s father. “And if the president is finally treating the crisis with a little more respect, maybe it’s because of the numbers,” said Noah, referencing the chilling death range of 100,000-240,000 Americans released by the White House on Wednesday. “And I don’t care what anybody says, that is a staggering number,” said Noah. “Even in Call of Duty, if you saw that many deaths, you’d be like, ‘I think I’ve been playing this game too much, I think I’m going to switch to Animal Crossing for a while.” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee focused on the pandemic’s impact on American women. Many of the nation’s most vulnerable frontline workers are women, Bee explained, especially nurses, and women are more likely to be low-wage or temporary workers who are the first to face layoffs when businesses shut down. Domestic workers, many of them undocumented immigrants who can’t file for unemployment or stimulus relief, are mostly women and many are now out of work. “America: come for the low-paying jobs with no security, stay for the quarantines,” Bee deadpanned. Meanwhile, several states such as Tennessee, Mississippi, Iowa, Oklahoma, Alabama and Ohio have declared abortions “non-essential services” and ordered clinics to shut down. “Some of these restrictions are being challenged, but that can’t happen quickly enough,” said Bee. “Now, if you’re, say, a dude, and you can’t quite empathize, let me put this in terms you might understand,” Bee explained. “Imagine driving hours to see your favorite band – which, if you’re a middle-aged white guy, I assume is Pearl Jam. It’s the only chance you’ll ever have to see Pearl Jam play live and if you don’t get to see Pearl Jam play live now, your life will never be the same. But then when you finally get to the concert, Pearl Jam refuses to go on. You’re devastated. And then Eddie Vedder forces you to have a baby. “The idea that any abortion isn’t essential is medically irresponsible,” Bee continued. “Not having access to safe and legal abortion is scary, dangerous and can even be lethal. And for victims of domestic abuse, so is just staying at home.” Isolation is essential for stopping the spread of Covid-19, said Bee, but for the 10 million Americans suffering from domestic abuse, it’s a “worst-case scenario”, though support groups are going virtual, and there are hotlines available for help. Basically, “Covid-19 hasn’t made new problems for women, it’s just exacerbated the old ones,” said Bee. “We need to do a lot more for women during this crisis – starting with getting us all an emotional support Wilson,” she said, referencing Tom Hanks’s companion from Cast Away."
"I’m not sure what has been more curious about Hugh Grant in recent months: his breaking stammering-toff type to play a geezer in Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen, or his becoming an unlikely Twitter hero as @HackedOffHugh. He’s given the blue bird to Boris Johnson (an “over-promoted rubber bath toy” leading a “gang of masturbatory prefects”); reminded Piers Morgan that his paper hacked actor Nigel Havers’ phone while his wife was dying of cancer; and posted his own mugshot when trolls attempted to wind him up about his 1995 arrest for receiving oral sex from a sex worker. Given this glorious renaissance, it seemed like a good time to further cement the cult of Hugh and unearth three streamable – and coincidentally rather softcore and Sapphic – curios from his back catalogue. This camp horror was directed by Ken Russell (Tommy, Women in Love) with a smirkingly wooden script. Grant plays James, a toff whose ancestors – legend has it – had run-ins with a mythical white worm. As Peter Walker wrote of Grant’s performance in the Guardian’s My Guilty Pleasure series, “I fancy you can sometimes see a flash of panic in his eyes, as if he’s wondering if a 2:1 from Oxford should really lead to this,” but still, he’s one of the few actors here not struggling with his accent. Grant is pitted against Amanda Donohoe’s Lady Silvia Marsh, dominatrix head of a serpent cult, who delivers her lines with all the vocal relish of Vincent Price, even when topless or when fellating a Boy Scout to death in a Jacuzzi. In a 1999 interview with The AV Club, Grant recalled that Russell would slur: ‘“Do it how I showed you, you fuckin’ cunt!’ Which is not classic Ingmar Bergman direction.” Ah, but dream sequences, saxophone, strap-ons – this film’s got it all. Buy or rent The Lair of the White Worm on YouTube Before we proceed, you should know that this erotic thriller is both set on a cruise ship and directed by Roman Polanski. Grant plays Nigel, an out-of-touch toff who has a tendency to make Prince Philip-style faux pas. He’s in a buttoned-up relationship with Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas), and it’s pushed to its limits when he meets bitter drunk Oscar (Peter Coyote), who’s keen to ply Nigel with whisky and bend his ear about his sexually and emotionally sadistic relationship with young French dancer, Mimi, played by Emmanuelle Seigner (who is Polanski’s wife). At first, Nigel is far too British to want to know the coarser details, but before too long, he too is obsessed by Mimi and the twisted role-reversal that occurs in this Parisian affair. Unapologetically melodramatic, Bitter Moon climaxes with a scene scored by Bryan Ferry’s Slave to Love. Buy or rent Bitter Moon on YouTube Grant is Tony, a progressive English reverend sent to the Blue Mountains with his wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) to take to task artist Norman Lindsay (yes that Norman Lindsay, played by Sam Neill) for his profane paintings. Once sequestered at the artist’s estate and introduced to his witchy trio of sultry muses – played by Portia de Rossi, Elle Macpherson and Kate Fischer – Tony and Estella start to feel some distinctly un-British stirrings. Grant seems in his element here; both able to stammer and go red on cue and work with his own dry sense of humour. Much of the joy of Sirens, though, is director John Duigan’s delight in rubbing quintessential Englishness up against ocker Australianness. The cast includes Ben Mendelsohn and John Polson as sheep shearers, and then-model Mark Gerber – now boss of the Oxford Art Factory – playing the blind and mute handyman everyone lusts after. Gerber tells Guardian Australia that he became Grant’s drinking partner at the Fairmont Resort – which the studio had taken over – at one point going over the script to Grant’s next film, Four Weddings and a Funeral, in Grant’s hotel room. “We’d be drinking whisky till five in the morning and I thought, my god, you must be a machine,” Gerber says. “Maybe he was method acting, because there was one scene where he had to act quite disheveled.” Buy or rent Sirens on YouTube or watch on Amazon Prime"

"I’m currently writing book four of a quartet, and it has the shadow of Covid-19 hanging over every part of it. It deals with a very different sort of pandemic (the loss of linear time) and is ostensibly about grief, about how we move past that which we’ve lost. Suddenly, the allegorical nature of it isn’t nearly as allegorical: our relationship with loss and grief has now been altered. I’m also working on a novel set in the fashion world of both a decade ago and the very near now, but that’s suddenly much harder to work on. It feels, in some ways, almost pointless to write, because we can’t say how scarred we will be as a society when we reach the other side of this thing. Writing the present – novels usually being published 18 months or so after they’re written – feels impossible. How long until we can travel to New York? Do print magazines exist? Will people shake hands still? Details that feel like nothing until you fixate on them. My anxieties led to something else: a desire to do more than I am. I’m working hard to feed my family, and staying indoors like we’ve been told to. But I’m lucky, and many people are not. I had an unpublished novel, K&R – a thriller, that’s entirely coincidentally about a family trapped in a house – and decided to sell it digitally, with all proceeds going to charities helping those who need it. The novel came from a dark time in my life; maybe this way it’ll be able to do some good. We stopped working a month ago, and the pace of change in my life is incredible. Some actors go job to job, but I started at EastEnders aged 10 playing Sonia, and this year I’ll turn 37. Just like for our audience, it’s odd to see the show close down when you’re part of it: it’s a home from home. It’s hard artistically, I’m worried about the muscles in my brain I use for acting. When I go on holiday, I always feel a bit rusty on returning. Maybe I’ll learn some monologues, look through the plays I’ve got on the bookshelf. All these cancellations have left huge voids in people’s lives, although thankfully – because EastEnders records ahead – our episodes are still airing. But if this goes on for a long time we’ll have to get creative. Maybe we can put something out there ourselves – video conversations between characters maybe?  And a decision will need to be made as to whether EastEnders is going to deal with this situation on screen. Sonia’s a nurse – she’d have been on the frontline of this pandemic. I’d been working on an exhibition called Found before this happened – going through my archive looking for natural moments. Suddenly, the pictures that stood out were these moments of affection between two people – simple, casual moments had now become so charged. I’ve been posting them on my Instagram with the hashtag #MomentOfAffection – because if we can’t have those moments, maybe we can get some solace out of being able to look at them. So far I’ve posted images such as Mark Rylance kissing another actor on the cheek backstage at Twelfth Night; circus performers holding hands on a tightrope; a couple on a riverboat in Hong Kong where he has his arm around her and she has her head on his shoulder. There’s a picture of my father Paul with his grandson Arthur lying on his tummy. It was taken in 1999 and captures that feeling of true affection. Right now, our situation is the same as everyone else’s – all the generations have landed where they are and everything has been thrown into question. Thank goodness for FaceTime and Zoom. In my studio, the physical work has stopped. I’ve been reading Harriet A Washington, who makes studies revealing that we don’t all breathethe same air. In north America, half the population breathes poor quality air and has asthma and high degrees of mortality. And coronavirus is making this inequality even more obvious – there’s a direct relationship between Covid-19 and the unequal accessibility to clean air. On 25 January, we were in Argentina with a lot of indigenous communities who live on the margins of a salt lake, where there’s huge extraction of lithium. We went up in a black, solar-powered hot air balloon and broke six world records. On it was written: “Yes to life, no to lithium, yes to water.” One tonne of lithium needs 200m litres of water to be extracted, and the indigenous people who live around that area are suffering from the process. When you’re flying in a hot air balloon which is just powered by the sun, you need to be really attuned to the weather. We’re all on board spaceship Earth, and there’s an unequal distribution of the resources. Many of the passengers are disappearing, human and not. There was a beautiful Instagram post from Extinction Rebellion who said that we have to be really careful talking about the diminishing of pollution in relationship with the coronavirus. We have to be attentive and sensitive to the loss of life. Instead of being on Earth together, the virus forces more distance between us. Hopefully, art can engage us in journeys of solidarity and connect us again. When my exhibition in Florence was closed, I didn’t even have the time to think about it – I’m more thinking about the lives of my family and friends in Italy, you know? I read an article the other day about an indigenous population who thought about coronavirus as a portal. If you’re not very careful you can fall in this portal, but if you’re careful it can take you into a new dimension. So I don’t read the newspaper more than two times a day, and I meditate. There’s a kind of media that’s addictive, it affects your ability to think by connecting people in a way that’s not good. Now when we start to digitise the art and move it into a new medium, we have to learn how to navigate the web – things that we thought we knew already. Sirens scream outside my window in New York, all day and all night. I’ll forget for a minute. It’ll start to feel like I’m playing hooky from the most tedious elements of my life: crowded subways, pointless meetings, obligatory dinners I never wanted to schedule in the first place. Then, sirens flood the apartment, and it’s like a glass of iced water to the face. When I ask my dad if he’s well stocked, he says there’s no need! He goes to the store every other day. I stress the importance of going to the store no more than once every two weeks, and I’m met with: “But I live right next to ShopRite!” My lectures feel limp and inarticulate – deja vu of me at 13 outside Claire’s Accessories, failing to convince him my quality of life would improve with a second ear piercing. He says: “You think this is scary – ha! The Islamic Revolution was scary.” I’ve been writing a film about that revolution, and it’s becoming more relevant by the hour. The sirens, the fear, the empty shelves, the new reality that’s no longer relevant an hour later. I’m finally a character in the stories I was raised on. It feels a bit like coming home. Only it’s a terrifying home where your heart lives in your oesophagus, and the threat of loss manifests itself as constant paranoid fear that rings in your ears like a score (the terrifying Mica Levi kind, not Philip Glass). There’s been a lot of noise in my life this past year – around how to be more popular, more palatable. Somewhere, amidst the sirens, the volume on all the bullshit got turned off. I’m feeling a level of joy and gratitude I hadn’t allowed myself. It reminds me of how sex becomes a bit spectacular when you feel you’re on the brink of losing your partner. Perhaps that will be what happens to art? Maybe this will become an opportunity to stop worrying about all the noise and find a way to connect to the core of who we are, why we do this, and what we’re saying. I’m an empathy artist and designer – as far as I know I’m the first in the world. So much of my work is about people coming together, and before Covid-19 that meant in person. I would run empathy workshops or have people collaborate on artworks. I’ve even had politicians playing with balloons in the Finnish parliament. The pandemic has proven a big challenge. But it’s also made me realise that focusing on empathy is more relevant than ever. So I’ve been working overtime to redesign my projects so that they can take place remotely. It’s given a newfound urgency to my work. I’m planning on using digital platforms, like Zoom and Google Hangouts. But I’m also also looking at things like literally phoning people up. I’ve got a tool called the Menu For Conversation, which is a guide to having a conversation that includes bigger questions that might be hard to ask under normal interactions. I’m hopeful people can use this to speak over the phone and connect. We know that loneliness is a huge issue in this country; being forced into isolation gives us all a chance to experience what it’s like for a lot of people in their daily lives. I hope we can all develop a sense of empathy that will be much more far-reaching than the current crisis."
"Artist Hew Locke was born in Edinburgh in 1959 and received an MA in sculpture from the Royal College of Art in 1994. His works, which use painting, drawing, photography, sculpture and installation to explore colonialism, have been acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Tate Britain, the V&A and the British Museum. In 2000, he won a Paul Hamlyn award. His solo exhibition, The Man Who Would Be King, will open at the Lowry, Salford later this year. Ambulance Call by Jacob Lawrence I have recently been getting interested in the work of Jacob Lawrence, who was active in the Harlem renaissance. His paintings have a strong Caribbean vibe. This very moving image is only about 2ft high. In the 1940s, Harlem hospital was one of the few places in New York to take black patients. This piece demonstrates that a painting does not have to be 20ft by 20ft to have impact; inspiring in these times when many of us artists are working at home in cramped spaces. Miguel Street by VS Naipaul This book has stayed on my shelf my entire life. The short stories were read to me and my brother and sister by my mother at bedtime. Set in nearby Trinidad [Locke grew up in Guyana], I could recognise the characters in these short stories as like the people I met on my own street. Naipaul’s cast includes B Wordsworth, the would-be poet who never progresses beyond his first line; Mr Popo, the carpenter who spends his days crafting “the thing without a name”; and my favourite, Man-Man, the self-proclaimed messiah. 30 Rock (All 4) 30 Rock should be provided on prescription. It is hilarious, full of quick witty one-liners. It is very sharp on issues of race, sexism in the workplace, gender fluidity, the working environment and career ambition. Filmed on the set of a fictional TV comedy programme in the Rockefeller Center in New York, it ran for seven series. I used to watch one episode daily to set me up before I left for work. Now I’m watching them all again. Laughter is an antidote to fear. Google Arts and Culture I have been obsessed with Indian miniatures for years, and particularly love the Kishangarh school of miniature paintings from Rajasthan. Miniatures lend themselves to online formats, as you can zoom in to see great detail on the Google arts and culture website. For me, Radha and Krishna in the Boat of Love by Nihâl Chand is an image of pure beauty and sensuality. I came to it by chance a couple of days ago, while taking virtual gallery tours. I have never seen this painting in person – it’s in the National Museum in Delhi – but I’m going to be able to spend time browsing its collection remotely. Tiger King (Netflix) In years to come, when people ask what we watched during lockdown, there will be one answer: we watched Tiger King. Although I know many other people have already recommended this, resistance is futile. I can only watch one episode a day, as it’s like eating a very, very rich cake. In these very crazy scary times, it depicts an equally intense, yet different, universe. It so fills my attention that, for an hour a day, the virus is pushedto the back of my mind. Smithsonian Magazine At a moment when my thoughts turned to mortality, I checked out the virtual tour of the ancient Egyptian tomb of Menna on the Smithsonian magazine website. Paradoxically, viewing the vibrant painted images from inside the tomb made me think not of death, but of beauty – farming, fishing, wildlife – things which we are missing and becoming more mindful of. In depicting their imagined afterlife, the artists have succeeded in creating a world in which you think about life and living fully, rather than loss and tragedy."

"What is a Quibi? A vague unit of 10 minutes or less, we’re told in the many ads now ubiquitous (and much maligned) on YouTube, Instagram and TV. A billionaire-backed attempt to mint a new one-word signature in entertainment, to unite Hollywood prestige and resources with the interstitial, “snackable” bumps of content popularized by lo-fi creators on video platforms and social media networks. More cynically, a deep-pocketed swing to monetize our last shreds of attention with an ironic wink (we’re all on our phones anyway), a way to amuse ourselves until we die. Either way, with a staggering $1.75bn in funding before its launch this week, Quibi is swinging big on one central question: can it change the nature of streaming? The company, conceived by Hollywood legend Jeffrey Katzenberg and executed by former Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, seems confident it can. Despite a saturated but still growing market of streaming services – titans Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and HBO and relative newcomers Disney +, Apple TV+, CBS AllAccess, the list could go on – Quibi sees a potentially rich corner in mobile-specific content diced into seven-to-10-minute “quick bites” (qui-bi, get it?). Which means it’s competing less with the full-length streamers than with Facebook, YouTube and TikTok – frenetic, lucrative factories of distraction and amusement for the snippets of time formerly reserved for your ambient mind. It’s perhaps a bit weird that this new service, aimed to be the disruptive insurgent of entertainment platforms and specifically conceived for younger audiences born with phones in their hands, emerges from the depths of Hollywood and the Silicon Valley establishment. Katzenberg, 69, was once chairman of Walt Disney Studios (1984 to 1994) and co-founded DreamWorks Animation, where he was the longtime CEO; Whitman, 63, was CEO of eBay as it mushroomed into a billion-dollar online marketplace, and was later CEO of Hewlett-Packard from 2011-2017 (she also unsuccessfully ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010). Both are billionaires, with the connections and wealth to pay for an army of prestige and/or popular talent, and the cache to sell their attention experiment as revolutionary and informed. Its advertising partners out of the gate include such business heavyweights as Google, Anheuser-Busch, Walmart, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble. Thus Quibi’s $1.75bn in funding to date has recruited a truly who’s who list of contributors which, in press materials and ads, blurs together in peak 2020 maximalist, chaotic fashion. Shows feature a call-sheet of such generationally varied stars as Joe Jonas, Idris Elba, Sophie Turner, Chrissy Teigen, Chance the Rapper, LeBron James, Jennifer Lopez, Reese Witherspoon, Liam Hemsworth, Christoph Waltz, Lena Waithe, Nicole Richie, Demi Lovato, Will Smith, Laura Dern, Kevin Hart, Tyra Banks, Zac Efron, Bill Murray and Laurence Fishburne. A-list creators including Steven Speilberg, Guillermo del Toro, Ridley Scott, Antoine Fuqua, Catherine Hardwicke and Sam Raimi have produced or directed shows exclusively for the service. Quibi has patented a new film-making technology, Turnstyle, which I’m sure is very complicated to engineer but essentially means you can shift your viewing from portrait mode to landscape and back seamlessly. And whereas other streaming giants have amassed or purchased their libraries of original or licensed content over time, Quibi will launch with a tsunami of homegrown shows. The service begins with three episodes each of its first 50 titles, and will roll out 25 episodes (or, as it calls it in a press release, “three hours of fresh, original, premium content”) every weekday afterward. All told, it’s planning to release 175 original shows in its first year, which translates into 8,500 “quibis” of content. The service has delineated its hulk of productions into three categories: Movies in Chapters, which will tell feature- or season-length stories in seven-to-10-minute bits; Unscripted and Docs, perhaps its most promising category given its persona power (internet star Chrissy Teigen being herself, but as Judge Judy!) and alignment with the most successful house style of YouTube; and Daily Essentials, five-to-six-minute news updates from such established houses as the BBC, NBC News, the Weather Channel, Telemundo and ESPN (also: Rotten Tomatoes, TMZ, and “Trailers by Fandango”). Quibi launches with a free 90-day trial – far more time than competitors Netflix and Amazon Prime (30 days) or Apple TV+ or Hulu/Disney+ (seven days). A monthly subscription will cost $4.99 with ads and $7.99 without ads, for which customers can view a true scattershot of content, from the aforementioned Chrissy’s Court, to Chance the Rapper’s reboot of MTV’s Punk’d, to Sophie Turner somehow escaping a plane crash on Survive, to Witherspoon waxing about cheetahs finding self-confidence on the savannah in Fierce Queens, to a documentary on James’s I Promise school, to, to, to. It’s an ostentatious and dizzying drop, in line with Katzenberg’s pitch of Quibi – or, rather, the Quibi short-form concept – as era-defining: “Five years from now, we want to come back on this stage and if we were successful, there will have been the era of movies, the era of television and the era of Quibi,” he told a crowd at South by Southwest in 2019. “What Google is to search, Quibi will be to short-form video.” There’s some precedent for a Hollywood pivot to short-form content, which used to be the purview of YouTubers or up-and-comers trying to establish a name on a short budget. (Insecure creator Issa Rae, for example, moved to a full-length HBO sitcom from her minutes-long webseries The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl.) In 2019, Netflix debuted several series with episodes of about 15 minutes: Special, Bonding, and the cult-hit sketch comedy series I Think You Should Leave. The quarter-hour comedy series Three Busy Debras, from star Sandy Honig (Isn’t It Romantic) and producer Amy Poehler, premiered in March. Sundance TV experimented with State of the Union, a Nick Hornby-written series in which Rosamund Pike and Chris O’Dowd spend 10-minute episodes at a bar before their marital therapy session. But Quibi is dropping into saturated, choppy and disorienting waters – it’s not going up against those modestly successful streaming experiments so much as the free intoxication of TikTok loops and YouTube videos, at a time when the interstitial bits of life Quibi is targeting – arriving 10 minutes ahead of your friends to the bar, waiting for coffee, commuting to school and/or work – have suddenly evaporated. It’s not a good sign for Quibi that podcast downloads in the US, the staple sidekick for many work commutes or background entertainment, have dipped at least 7% since mass shutdowns and work-from-home orders began in mid-March. “Honestly, we don’t know what to expect,” Whitman told MarketWatch days before Quibi’s launch, though she still saw potential in slipping Quibi into shutdown non-routines: “People still have their in-between moments to be entertained, whether after home schooling or Zoom meetings.” Whether or not people want to be further entertained in those remaining free moments is, it appears, an assumption Quibi has made for us. But whether the service can command the attention it has already assumed to be deeply fractured is, they would say, a bet worth pouring money into."
"I’m going to try to describe to you the general vibe of Drew McIntyre. Drew McIntyre is a WWE Superstar. Hundreds of millions of people know this, but many others do not. This is the nature of World Wrestling Entertainment Superstardom – and Drew McIntyre is cheerfully resigned to it. He looks heavy, physically, as though it would take six or seven men – normal men – or eight or nine little weaklings like me, to lift him. Drew McIntyre could lift himself up, though, because he has the raw power of an industrial digger. He’s lounging on a sofa in front of me, pre-lockdown, a steak dinner lingering just behind him. And though he is unfailingly polite – thoughtful and sincere with just a crispy little burnt crust of humour round the edges – he does give off the energy, palpably, that he could toss the sofa he’s sitting on up in the air like a baseball and headbutt it through the adjacent wall. He is at once capable of tenderly nuzzling a small puppy and kicking someone’s head through a pub urinal – and that’s what makes him such a captivating superstar. He is hard and soft. He is meat and iron. There’s a lot going on with him. Earlier this year, McIntyre became the first Briton to win WWE’s Royal Rumble, a wrestling centrepiece event where dozens of the organisation’s storylines converge in a 30-man brawl from which a sole winner emerges. Meanwhile millions of wrestling fans all over the world stay at home watching late into the night, elbow-dropping their furniture in jubilation. Last week, in an empty arena, but viewed by an inflated audience self-isolating at home, he won his title-decider against American wrestling royalty Brock Lesnar in what is the sport’s answer to the Superbowl – WrestleMania 36 – becoming the first Brit ever to do so. So: Drew McIntyre is at the absolute top of his game. Drew McIntyre is making history right now. Drew McIntyre is a megastar. Drew McIntyre is a superstar. But it almost didn’t happen at all. We should first briefly confront the reality of wrestling. If you are 10 years old, please don’t read this bit… Yes, it is scripted. And many of the feuds aren’t real (a surprisingly high number of them, however, are). But saying wrestling is inauthentic for not being based on actual frenzied violence is like blasting ballet dancers for not being swans. It zooms out too pragmatically from the centre of the entertainment itself, ignores the high art of pirouetting elbow-first on to someone’s head without killing them in front of an 80,000-strong crowd who you’ve made fall so in love with you that they are deliriously chanting your name. Wrestling, at it’s best, is a Shakespearean good-versus-bad story told through audacious acts of physical violence and microphone shit-talking. And it’s big business. Big, big, astonishingly big, business. Some facts: according to the Forbes list, WrestleMania is the sixth most valuable sports brand in the world, ahead of the Winter Olympics and the Champions League (the Champions League!). You might not watch it, but heaps of other people do. WWE programming streams to more than 800m households worldwide every year, in 180 countries and in 28 different languages. The Mattel/WWE action figure collaboration is frequently within Mattel’s top-two most sold toys. The various WWE imprints have a combined billion-plus followers on social media. If you still don’t get how big it all is, imagine every football fan on Earth glued to the exact same soap opera. McIntyre – whose real name is Drew Galloway, which is important to note, because occasionally Galloway answers and occasionally McIntyre does – was 21 when he signed to WWE. (He is now 34.) He was the first Scotsman ever to do so and for a while everything seemed to be going smoothly. He’d become a wrestling nut at 10, and by 15 was pestering his mother to let him train full time; by 17, he’d broken into Scottish independent wrestling and was making his way as a professional. When he was 23, the WWE boss Vince McMahon walked into a packed centre of an arena in Oklahoma and announced that the then semi-unknown McIntyre – baby-faced, smooth-chested, ponytailed and boxed into a big-man suit, looking for all the world like a wedding saxophonist rather than someone who could bench-press a tank – was his “Chosen One”, a future world champion in the making. And then… he wasn’t. For the duration of his 20s, WWE didn’t know what to do with McIntyre. After an impressive start, he began to struggle for airtime, and then drifted down the ranks. He had all the raw ingredients. At 6ft 5in, he was an athletic marvel, capable of extraordinary acts of in-ring physicality. But wrestling isn’t just about how high you can kick and how convincingly you can take a steel chair to the face. Wrestling is an industry shaped by scriptwriters, tradition and – crucially – the whims of the crowd – and McIntyre managed to slip the notice of all three. By the age of 29 he was partying too much and standing out too little. In 2014, he was finally released from his WWE contract. McIntyre had started small because he’d had to – 17 years ago, there was barely a British scene to wrestle in. In the summer between sixth form and university, he worked with independent wrestling tours that played the Butlin’s circuit. Travelling five or six days a week, playing nightly to crowds of up to 2,000, he learned the basics by jumping in at the deep end. “It taught me how to play for large audiences who weren’t wrestling fans,” he says now. “You had to learn your audience and how to make them cheer for you as the good guy, or boo you as the bad guy – and then give them a good show. Some would obviously think, ‘Oh, wrestling, I don’t like wrestling.’ But by the end of the night, I knew they’d be on their feet.” “But how do you do that?” I ask, and McIntyre goes to a wistful, distant place. “I’m trying to think how to verbalise it… it comes kind of naturally, now. I guess it’s just telling the simplest story you can tell. And the great thing about wrestling, it’s a blank canvas. You’re out there, you’re live – you’re doing your own stunts – and through the match, hopefully you can tell a simple good guy/bad guy story for everyone to understand. Hopefully, the bad guy will get on the crowd and give them something to work with: get them all riled up so they go, ‘man I want someone to punch their face off’. That’s where the good guy comes in. And then you get to play the part of the audience member, punching their face off on their behalf.” You sense that the basics of those early wrestling days – goodies, baddies and Butlin’s – are still in place, now, in the multimillion dollar events McIntyre heads up, the storylines more polished, maybe, the muscles more oiled, but the primal structure underpinning it the same. He is the force for good, Brock Lesnar is the force of evil, and someone is going to punch someone’s face off, and we’re all going to go nuts. He leans forward, still in the zone. “And once you get the crowd, you know, into it like that, then there’s nothing more fun than playing with their emotions. When the bad guy is beating the good guy, and they’re like” – he drops his voice in mock fury – “‘God I just want this guy to get up and punch him,’ and when he finally does get a punch in the face, and everybody explodes? That’s the best feeling in the world. And that’s the art to it, I guess.” You may think wrestling is a billion-dollar industry built on muscles, but you’re wrong. It’s built on emotions, too. After WWE let him go, McIntyre stared into the mirror and figured out what he wanted. His first move was to throw himself back into the independent circuit as hard as he possibly could. (His second move was to grow a gnarly beard.) In that period, it seems as if McIntyre took every non-WWE match on the planet: he won titles under the Insane Championship Wrestling and Evolve brands, as well as domestic belts in Australia, Scotland and Denmark. “When I was fired I told myself: ‘This is on you.’ The only person I had to blame was myself. I said: ‘This was the dream you wanted. You’re gonna have to prove to everybody you are who they thought you were in the beginning.’ And from that moment on, I was in the gym, working as hard as I could. I was travelling as much as I could. Anybody who would have me, I would wrestle for them. Any interview I could do to practise getting better at situations like this, I would do, just to build myself up in every possible area.” Twice during our interview I ask McIntyre if he ever gets scared, and I get a slightly different response. Watching his fight against another wrestler, Roman Reigns, is genuinely terrifying – watching a 6’3” Aquaman-in-a-vest storm towards the camera in a pitch black arena, let alone being the man he’s about to beat up. I ask McIntyre, who was waiting in the ring to get his ass kicked, whether a pang of genuine fear ever gets to him. “I don’t get scared,” he says, with a bravado tone I recognise from hard lads the world over. “I was face-to-face with Brock Lesnar two weeks ago, and I wasn’t remotely scared. Drew Galloway might get beaten up by Brock Lesnar, but Drew McIntyre believes 100% he’s gonna kick Brock Lesnar’s ass.” But when we talk about his time out of the company, the freefall away from the safety net of his 20s and the uncertainty of his future as a man who pinned everything on one dream and, looming on the edge of 30, having it snatched away from him, there’s a moment where Galloway’s fear peeks out over McIntyre’s mask. “I know I like to pretend I was confident the whole time and that things were going to work out, but I was very scared, realistically, that things weren’t. And yeah, I just put on a ‘fake it ‘til you make it’ face, I kept a confident face on. But behind closed doors – and we’ve been talking a lot about this recently, my wife and I – she’s been reminding me how I was feeling during that period. I was gone from the company and I was worried and I was anxious and I was angry and... all these different emotions. In my mind, I’m good at blocking out negative memories. In my mind I believed I was right back on the horse and I succeeded instantly, which is not exactly true. And I think the big turning point for everything was breaking my neck one time.” Ah, uh? What? In the midst of McIntyre’s WWE wilderness, he was dropped on his head during a match, fracturing two of his vertebrae and confined to a brace for eight weeks. Injuries for wrestlers, though a natural part of the game, can be devastating. If you can’t wrestle, you can’t work. Perilous contracts can fall through while in rehabilitation, long-planned storylines fizzle out and a fickle wrestling crowd forgets who you are. McIntyre’s neck break threatened his comeback. But while he was supposed to be on a sofa letting his neck fuse back together, he was still out drinking, partying and seeing friends. McIntyre’s wife, Kaitlyn Frohnapfel – who he met six months before his WWE release, and who “hates wrestling” – told him in no uncertain terms that he needed to cut out the drinking. “And she was 100% right. I realised I didn’t look as good as I should. I started looking into diet. I started working with a meal-plan company and I cut out the partying. When I came back from the neck break, my physique had changed completely. I looked better than I’d ever looked. And I was back in WWE within three months.” A cursory read of McIntyre’s story – working hard and getting what he wanted so young, busting the flush, learning the hard way, microwaving a Tupperware of eggs for breakfast because he broke his own neck, getting told to do things then furiously doing them – is, simply, he was a man in his 20s, once. He was young and he was cocky and he needed to be taught that a little humility and a lot of facial hair could transform him completely. I start to ask if, had he had the opportunities he’s fought for now in his early career, he would have made the most of them, and for the first time in our conversation he interrupts me. “I would not have been able to pull them off,” he says. “Maybe physically – in the ring, OK – but I wouldn’t have been able to handle myself.” In a world of manufactured storylines, McIntyre’s genuine life arc is one of the more compelling. Like wrestling, his life is just a simple story studded with exquisite acts of violence. And kicking Brock Lesnar’s face off in an arena last week is just another dose of destiny along the way. WrestleMania 36 is now on the WWE Network"
"Name: Gene Attell Fischer.Age: 11 months.Appearance: All babies look the same – a cross between Winston Churchill and a baked bean.Parentage: Mother is the American comedian and actor Amy Schumer, father is the chef Chris Fischer.Odd name Gene Attell. It sounds like ... Yes, Amy and Chris realise that and have just announced they are taking appropriate action. Genital! OK. It’s been rectified. Genital fissure!! No need to rub it in. We all make mistakes. Schumer revealed this week on her podcast, 3 Girls, 1 Keith, that the baby’s middle name – inspired by fellow comedian Dave Attell, with whom she appeared in the film Trainwreck in 2015 – had been changed to David.Very nice. Though his original name is quite striking. Could have been tough for a 10-year-old.Children’s names are a nightmare. Who can forget Zowie Bowie? Or Duncan Jones, as he prefers to be called these days.Or Frank Zappa’s daughter Moon Unit? Sister of Dweezil, Ahmet and Diva.What is it about celebs? Novelty, I guess. Alicia Silverstone’s son is called Bear Blu. Kate Winslet went for Bear Blaze. Cameron Diaz has a daughter called Raddix while Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin opted for Apple and Moses.Doesn’t Jamie Oliver have some unusually named children? If you consider Poppy Honey, Daisy Boo, Petal Blossom, Buddy Bear and River Rocket unusual, yes. Or River Rocket Blue Dallas, to give the youngest child his full name. Can you call a child anything you like? Good question. A couple in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh have just called their newborn twins Corona and Covid in honour of the lockdown that made it hard for them to reach the hospital. The authorities have accepted it, but the extended family is putting pressure on the proud parents to change the names. Aren’t there laws against embarrassing names? Depends where you live. In the US, there are very few restrictions, which is why young Adolf Hitler Campbell did eventually get his birthday cake in a famous test case in 2008.That’s incredible. The land of the free, my friend. The UK is fairly liberal, but has banned Martian, Monkey and Rogue in recent years. The French are less tough than they used to be, but have recently blocked Nutella, Manhattan, Prince William and Mini Cooper. Germany is less well disposed than the US to Adolf Hitler and also banned a Turkish couple in Cologne from naming their offspring Osama Bin Laden.Not to be confused with: Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116 (pronounced Albin), the name a Swedish couple chose for their son in 1991 in protest against Sweden’s restrictive naming law. It was rejected. Do say: “I’ve always liked the name Sandra.”Don’t say: “What about calling her Chlamydia? That sounds sweet.”"
"In our new series Stream Team, Guardian Australia’s arts writers dig out their favourite hidden gems of streaming to help you  while away some isolated hours. It’s the summer of 1789 and people in cities are mad about the unequal distribution of supplies. That’s where we find ourselves at the opening of Benoît Jacquot’s 2012 film Farewell, My Queen, following three days in Versailles on the eve of the French revolution. Now streaming on SBS On Demand, the plot of the French-language film revolves around a servant, Sidonie (Léa Seydoux), who is the reader (or “assistant reader”, as she is reminded by more senior servants) to Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger). Farewell, My Queen initially invites its audience into a lush world in which every woman is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. Affairs are conducted in public and looks are longingly exchanged in corridors. It’s a universe of embroidered silk gowns, violet perfume, delicate hair ribbons, tiny cakes and walks in sun-drenched, manicured gardens. Coffee is described as tasting like “bitter velvet” and is drunk while tucked up among floral sheets in four-poster beds. Noblewomen cluster in dark corners and whisper sweet nothings to each other – this movie features many scenes of French women just breathing on each other. Marie Antoinette has fashion magazines read to her when she wakes up, while people holding empty bowls are shooed away from the palace’s golden gates. Historical spoiler: all of this decadence won’t last for long. Less than 10 minutes into the film the tide is beginning to turn for the royal family. Sidonie, who harbours a passionate loyalty to the queen, doesn’t understand it. Other servants grumble about having to stitch tapestries and run ridiculous errands, but Sidonie thinks her job feels like “a journey into a magical land”. She is jealous when an Italian gondolier tells her that the queen is having an affair with the Duchess of Polignac (Virginie Ledoyen). When an older woman of the court casually mentions, “Hey, I hear there’s not much bread in Paris,” Sidonie snaps, “Stop talking nonsense!” And then suddenly it’s the morning of 15 July, and footmen are carrying valuables out of Versailles and servants are whispering about some ruckus at the Bastille last night. Even if you’re not into period dramas (I don’t understand you, but your business is your own) the decadence and degradation of Farewell, My Queen will probably still appeal. Like The Favourite, Portrait of a Lady on Fire and Marie Antoinette, it feels a little edgier, with a slightly more modern sensibility than other corset-heavy dramas. Even though we know, thanks to history, where the story ends, Farewell, My Queen still manages to feel like a workplace thriller. We don’t spend much time with Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI; instead we spend it with the ladies’ maids and palace librarians who rush around dark corridors, anguished faces illuminated by candlelight, wondering if the revolutionaries will want to dispose of them too. “What will happen to us?” a wide-eyed Sidonie asks the librarian, suddenly realising that her employer might not be so popular on the outside. When pamphlets start circulating with a list of heads that need to be cut off for France to be renewed, the nobles also scramble to escape or wait anxiously for the king and queen’s instructions while tense violin music screeches in the background. Sidonie, disgusted that so much blame is being placed on Marie Antoinette and shocked that the ladies who were sucking up to her a week ago are now riffling through her undies to see what they can sell, also has her loyalty tested. Farewell, My Queen isn’t exactly relaxing, but something about stories of extremely wealthy people not sharing their resources feels essential at this moment. Also, look at the dresses!"
"This week we asked arts workers to share how their livelihoods were being affected by the coronavirus. Since then, the UK government’s measures to give financial aid to the self-employed will help the sector – but many are still deeply concerned about the lack of work available in the coming months. Here are some of the nearly 150 stories we received. Thanks to everyone who got in touch. Stephen Laughton, 38, playwright and TV writerMy play, One Jewish Boy, opened in the West End on 10 March – a huge step up for me. I had TV deals lined up, a movie deal on the cards, another play about to start in New York. The play managed to stay open for one week. It got us to press night, and much like its original fringe run, was a critical success – four and five stars, and that first week was packed out. It was the moment I’d been waiting for. But I knew what was coming – a moment I hoped I would cherish for ever was tinged with crushing defeat. It felt as if everything we had worked for – all the abuse (my play is about antisemitism and I was on the receiving end of a lot of it), all the hard work, the blood, joy, sweat and tears – just faded away. The next day it got worse: I didn’t quite take in the monumental loss of having every gig I had lined up, cancelled. In the short term, I’m pretty screwed, the financial loss from the cancellation of two plays, a TV and a film gig has hit the tens of thousands. That makes it sound as if I always earn at this level – I don’t and I haven’t. I’ve been working hand to mouth and now, when it looked as if I might finally be able to breathe, I don’t know when I’ll get paid again. I just need to find a way to keep my head above water. Michael Heggett, 59, lighting engineerMy entire work calendar for 2020 went away in the three days from 16 March. I lost the Pet Shop Boys world tour and the Olympic Games, which amounts to nine months of solid work and around £60,000 gross turnover. I have no other work on my books until November, which is a UK tour with Tim Minchin – if it goes ahead. As venues are closed and also gatherings of people banned and film sets closed, I will not be able to earn a living for the foreseeable time. My business and livelihood are completely destroyed. Matthew Reed, 40, comedianI had a full diary of gigs, a full summer of festivals and various clubs around the country, then overnight nothing, wiping out every penny for the foreseeable. My agents, Getcomedy, have been brilliant, but there’s no work, so they, too, are in a terrible situation. I’m a compere and in demand – I play every major club on the circuit and have done for years. So to go from every weekend full and plenty of midweek gigs to zero has been terrifying. The fragility of my situation has y crept up on me, and it’s also shown how little people really care. At a comedy night, if you do well you’re told: “Well done”, back slapped, thanked for a good night. “Couldn’t do what you do mate. It takes balls.” Now my entire income has gone I’ve been told, “Well, you’re just a comedian!” and, “Get a proper job.” I’ve had “proper” jobs – I’ve worked very hard to be where I am and comedy is a job. I’ve travelled miles for 20-minute sets, and the pay has been the same since I started – our wages haven’t gone up with inflation. People assume we are on a fortune, which just isn’t true. I absolutely love being a comedian, and this has been the worst thing that’s ever happened to me professionally. But apparently it’s not as valid as an office worker losing their “proper job”. Anonymous, actor for 37 yearsAfter a good five months in theatre and television and feeling as if I was turning a corner after a difficult period, I found the rug pulled from under my feet. Future work cancelled. Income owed not likely to be received. No hope of working in my career for many, many months to come. I am already writing this year off. My industry has been decimated and the aftermath will be catastrophic. I do not know how I will survive this with no savings behind me. I love my job, but I feel totally broken and my mental health is very, very fragile. Denise Francis, 55, director of theatre education company Firehorse ProductionsI had three actors on contract for a five-week tour in June and July – this has now been cancelled, as schools are shut. There may be a slight chance we can scramble a three-week tour for November, but it is the two autumn tours that sustain us throughout the year, and not being able to produce them jeopardises the future of Firehorse. Two years ago, I also established the charity Afan Arts, giving the opportunity to pupils from surrounding schools to work alongside professional actors and film crews. Our third project Same But Different, two years in the planning, was due to begin at the end of July, but this has had to be cancelled. The year 11 pupils were devastated, another thing they have missed out on. We invest in our actors, love to see them grow and flourish – now we will not see that this year. It has been like watching your world crumble. Anonymous, 37, actorOn 16 March, a couple of hours before our cast were due on stage, we were told our show was cancelled that evening with immediate effect. Since then, it has become apparent that the production will not reopen anytime soon, and as yet we have no clarity on whether we will continue to be paid. My biggest fear is that our producer may be forced to use the force majeure clause in our contracts, allowing them to terminate our employment with immediate effect. Were that to happen, I would be left £40,000 out of pocket, that figure representing what I would have earned during the remainder of the show’s run. Colette Meacher, writer, editor and lecturerI’ve had mild symptoms of Covid-19, but as I effectively work on zero-hours contracts I’m not eligible for statutory sick pay. And, as it’s now the Easter break, my teaching hours are finished and my freelance editing and writing work has dried up, meaning that I don’t have a single commission or job on my desk. I’m stressed, sick and skint – but I’d still be working if I could as I urgently and desperately need some money for the mortgage, bills and, heck, even just to be able to go out and buy some food. It’s been nearly four weeks since I last got paid, and that was a grand total of £600 – pretty good by most months’ standards. Mike Nichamin, 56, live audio systems engineerAll touring is off as venues have closed and large gatherings banned. I was on tour in Europe at the time with the show An Evening with Whitney Houston, a hologram tour. I have now applied to Tesco as a delivery driver for £9 an hour, which won’t even cover my expenses. Bethany, 20, dancerI’m supposed to be moving to Greece at the end of March for a seven-month contract, but obviously with no flights this has been postponed for the foreseeable. This is extremely distressing as for dancers a summer season can sometimes be their only income for the year. With so much uncertainty, I’m not sure if I will ever get there to complete the season, and in the meantime I’m stuck in the UK with no income. Anonymous, 30, artistAs a self-employed artist, my work is piecemeal and precarious. I don’t have a fixed income and my earnings fluctuate month to month. I’m still in receipt of the ghostly working tax credits, which has been a lifeline in more difficult times but at £54 a week are not enough to live on. Occasionally I sell a work, pick up some teaching hours or am successful with a funding application. While the financial impact of Covid-19 is massive on those working in the arts, the impact of coronavirus goes beyond the loss of wages – it affects our visibility. Projects which have been in the pipeline for many months are put on hold, or no longer possible. Perhaps they lose their relevance as this global crisis escalates as it has. Galleries and cultural spaces rearrange their programmes, pushing an already competitive workforce into greater competition for places. This situation is complicated for us all, but without support, we risk a whole generation of artists slipping away. David, 32, artist and gallery workerMany artists work freelance as either an assistant to a more established artist, or as a technician/handler for museums and galleries. I fall in this latter group. I love the work – we do anything from packing up prints to building gallery walls or making bespoke elements of the exhibition. With museums and galleries closed until further notice, the workforce who build and hang the exhibitions are simply not required. The work is always seasonal, and so we have large chunks of work booked months ahead, knowing that we have a two- to three-month gap in work while the exhibition is open to the public. I’ve had a mixed response to coronavirus closures. One gallery has said that it will honour booked work and pay freelancers regardless of whether we are physically able to complete the job. This is absolutely wonderful and will help hugely. It is, however, an exception rather than the norm. Most galleries and museums have cancelled work – I’ve lost work equivalent to two and a half months’ pay, and from talking to friends, that seems quite light. Jonny Byers, 39, cellistI had a full diary of work, and every single concert until at least July has been cancelled or, at best, postponed. An entire tour of a Handel opera; a week of Beethoven symphonies; concerts at smaller venues such as the Wigmore Hall. A completely empty diary, which means £0 coming in. Many of the groups I perform for won’t have a large amount of financial reserves so are now walking an even thinner tightrope attempting to ride out this storm. I have bills, instrument insurance, not to mention food buying, and many other outgoings to attempt to cover with no idea how it’s all going to pan out. Sadly, everyone is in the same boat right now, but once orchestras are gone, they’re gone, and we’ll need music more than ever after this. Dan, 37, stage managerOne show was cancelled mid-run and we were told not to come in the next day. The following job, which was supposed to take me to July, was postponed until 2021. All income has stopped and with no help from the government so far, we have had to contact our landlords and bill providers to plead for a payment break. We will get to a point where we have to choose between paying bills and eating. There is no safety net. I am also in the unfortunate situation that I have a very sick relative in hospital which, added to the worry about no income and possible eviction, is having a huge detrimental effect on my mental health. Anonymous, 30, freelance stage managerSo far, I have lost out on thousands. Last week, the tour that I was working on was cancelled after the government urged people not to go out. There were no compensation measures as all insurances were void when the WHO declared the virus a pandemic. The promoter took their fee back, tickets were refunded and the artist made a huge loss. All future bookings have been postponed too. A two-month project that I was meant to start on 1 April has been pushed back, but we don’t know when that will be rescheduled. Festivals have been cancelled. My next working day is currently 1 July, but that could also be postponed. That’s three and a half months of loss of earnings – and to add salt to my wounds, I’m due to get married overseas in September. Clare, 51, self-employed art tutorAs a result of the current situation I closed the studio last week. Many of the artists who attend are over 70, and although the classes are small I can’t guarantee safety. I have set up a WhatsApp group to keep us all in touch with each other – we share experiences, jokes and thoughts as well as art-related articles. Today, I launched an online art class to which nearly 40 of the group have signed up. So far, it seems to be working despite my lack of techie knowledge – think Acorn Antiques level of production. I hope this will provide some income to tide me over until I can reopen the studio, and will keep the social element of the group together. Anonymous, 45, community artistI work full time in the community and all my work is on freelance contracts. In two days, every project I have got cancelled as they are all people-based. I have no income, no sick pay, and my work diary is a black hole. I am used to uncertainty and flexibility in my work, but now I feel totally baffled as to how I will get an income. I don’t know when or if these projects will ever be rescheduled, and I worry about some of the people I work with who depend on the social aspect of these arts projects – one project I worked on involves making artworks for a recovery garden, for people with addictions, and I worry about how they are coping alone. We will be needed to help restore community spirit when this crisis is over – arts are never valued by the government, yet people are surviving these hard times through creativity and resourcefulness. Peter, 44, freelance opera singerThe theatres are shut. I’m fortunate enough to have current extra chorus contracts honoured, but future ones are undecided. With schools, each one has its own safeguarding policy and setting up teaching from home is problematic – hours are down already. All of the concerts I’ve had lined up are postponed or cancelled, auditionstoo. Regular chorister work in synagogue has stopped and the church that I regularly sing at are paying up to June. My private teaching has stopped – even though it’s a few students, over time you really start to feel it. I’m losing more than half of my income, with projected expectations that the industry will suffer longer and there will be less work in the future. I will need to adapt and find other sources. Gillian Garrity, 48, theatre producerMy business partner, Margaret-Anne O’Donnell, and I started our own producing company, Raw Material Arts, two years ago. We have worked in the theatre industry for more than 20 years each, touring theatre within the UK and across the world. A UK/Australian co-production that was due to tour to 12 venues across Scotland beginning next month has been cancelled; a tour to an arts festival in Egypt has been cancelled; an artist residency due to take place in Nepal has been cancelled; we have three mid/large scale co-productions with three Scottish venues now on hold; a New York transfer of a current production on hold. Our potential to earn income has frozen. We work with and employ directors, lighting designers, sound designers, actors, stage managers, costume designers and many more freelance artists. We have received support from Creative Scotland to pay our team for projects that have taken place and/or are already funded, but we cannot deliver. We have no means to rehearse or present any work, meaning we have no potential to earn income. Anonymous, 39, stage managerI don’t know anyone who’s still working, the entire industry has gone. The theatres all shut once Boris Johnson advised people not to go – there was no more work to do. I went to help clear the rehearsal room we had been using and that was that. I’ve worked since I was 17, I’ve never not had a job. I’ve always paid my taxes and I’ve used the benefits system once to cover a gap of five weeks between contracts back when I first moved to London in 2009. Now I don’t know what to do. My partner is in the same position and has lost a year’s work, as has my sister, as have most of my friends. We have a little bit of a buffer, probably enough to survive the next month or two, but beyond that things are pretty scary. I’m happy to do whatever I need – I’ve handed out CVs in supermarkets, filled out forms online, but so far no replies. I just think people see theatre on a CV and don’t know what to do with it, or assume you’ll be some kind of luvvie who moans about breaking a nail. The reality is we’re used to 16-hour days, 50-plus hour weeks, hard physical work, problem solving and team working, not to mention working under pressure to a deadline. After all, the show must go on."
"You either love him or hate him, but the Adam Sandler comedy special on Netflix is hilarious. It has made me want to push the boundaries of traditional standup a bit more. My maths handbook in school. All I could really do was laugh. The Afrikaans channels in South Africa do reality TV very well. I once watched an Afrikaans version of Come Dine With Me and nearly died from laughter. I probably quote Anchorman on a daily basis. It has to be my mother. Not as in the way a comedian is funny. More like a super cringe “posting photos of her garden on Facebook” kind of funny. Once a dog barked at me during my set. Everyone always laughs when I wear a Speedo, but I don’t find it funny at all. I think I look great. I played a villain in a Shakespeare play and had to shave the sides and leave a little patch at the top. As if my moustache doesn’t make me look creepy enough. I mostly have anxiety-filled nightmares, so trying to pick the funniest one would be like picking the funniest of all the scary clowns. A dog with sunglasses on. Why is it funny? It shouldn’t be. It’s just a dog with sunglasses on. Yet it’s hilarious. 8888888. Brexit. For Schalk Bezuidenhout’s future live dates, visit schalkbezuidenhout.com. Follow him on Twitter @schalkiebez"
"What is an art enthusiast to do, now galleries and museums around the world have closed their doors? The Getty museum, based in Los Angeles, has a suggestion: recreate famous works of art using household items. The institution issued the challenge to its Twitter followers on Thursday last week: choose your favourite artwork, recreate it using three items lying around your house and share it with the world on social media. The responses have ranged from the hilarious to the impressive, with recreated artworks including classics such as Master of Saint Cecilia’s Madonna and Child, the anonymously created Virgin, Saint Elizabeth, and the Infants John the Baptist and Christ; as well as modern works such as Helen Frankenthaler’s Mirabelle – now featuring strategic but perhaps inadvisable use of that precious commodity, toilet paper. The Getty museum is not the first to suggest whiling away self-isolation with ad hoc art experiments. Its tweet was predated by a few days by an Instagram account, @covidclassics, created by “four roommates who love art … and are indefinitely quarantined”. Over the course of a week, the roommates, based in the US, have been recreating classic works of art and sharing them on social media. The recreations, which began with Jacques-Louis David’s The Death of Marat, have become progressively more detailed and adventurous. The most recent post at the time of writing was a version of the surrealist work The Son of Man by René Magritte, including a behind-the-scenes look at how they managed to get an apple to appear as if it was floating in front of model Sam Haller’s face. “If you ever need a model for the soft face of a Dutch peasant girl, I’m your man,” said Haller when he shared the pictures on Facebook last week, including one of him as Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring. If you have uploaded your own creation to social media, please feel free to share in the comments below."
"Wanda Sykes. Her new Netflix special is brilliant. I was a teenager when I first watched French and Saunders and I couldn’t believe how funny it was. The Exorcist spoof is pretty perfect.  Dolly Alderton’s Everything I Know About Love was brilliant. I laughed so hard while reading it on the bus in London a girl turned round and looked at me, saw what I was reading and said: “I loved that book.” It makes people friendly in London – imagine that! I will always love The Royle Family. I think Sue Johnston is perfect in it. Airplane. “Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.” Tom Allen is one of my best friends and he makes me absolutely howl. We went to New York Pride last year and we laughed from the moment we left to the moment we got back. My current tour is called Dance Like Everyone’s Watching and during a show in Wales, about 45 minutes in, a couple got up to leave. I said: “Sorry you didn’t like the show,” and the lady replied: “We thought it was a dancing show.” What I loved is it took 45 minutes! She must have been thinking: “This lesbian is funny enough but when is she gonna get on her tap shoes?!” Because of lockdown, my hair is currently long enough for curtains. Very 90s boyband. I dreamed Mel C needed me to change the oil in her car. Trendy, because people that use it rarely are. Suzi Ruffell appears in Comedy Against Living Miserably 2, Wednesday 22 April, 9pm, Dave"
"Sometimes it seems like every TV show is obsessed with pain. Walter White got cancer, then descended into a criminal underworld. Game of Thrones was a weekly bloodsport. Meredith Grey has survived so much that there are listicles chronicling her trauma. Catastrophe is a much rarer show. It’s less interested in pain itself than the characters’ ability to matter-of-factly (and hilariously) carry on in spite of it. “A terrible thing has happened,” says Rob, an American who has just got a woman pregnant after a brief hookup in London. “Let’s just make the best of it.” An unplanned pregnancy is obviously not Game of Thrones “your father has been decapitated by a tyrannical boy king” level bad, but it does completely upend the characters’ lives. Rob Norris (Rob Delaney) and Sharon Morris (Sharon Horgan) decide to go ahead with the pregnancy, which turns into a marriage, which turns into a life together – which comes with its own problems. Catastrophe is a dark comedy about how quickly life can change, and the pain and pleasure that coexist when it does. The four-season series was written and created by Delaney and Horgan, and much of the story is drawn from their lives. Horgan fell pregnant after dating her now-husband for just a few months. And like his character, Delaney is an American recovering alcoholic who now lives with his family in London. It’s likely because of this that the show feels so rooted in reality. On screen, Rob and Sharon deal with addiction, infidelity and death with equal parts patience and love and resilience. But it’s never saccharine. Their humour is dry, brash and kind of gross. And their marriage is sturdy and no bullshit – which in its own way can be incredibly romantic. As Delaney once said, Rob and Sharon are a “head down, one-foot-in-front-of-the-other, against-the-wind, holding-hands couple and they love each other … [Marriage is much] richer, and more majestic, and magnificent, and terrifying than is often portrayed in sitcoms.” This is a good reminder of what you’re capable of if you’re lucky enough to be locked in with a person you love. Right now, it feels like binge-watchers are either wilfully spiralling into pandemic panic (hello Contagion) or leaning away from it completely with comfort TV. Both are valid and fine. We’re all doing the best we can with what we need in the moment. But at a time of global catastrophe and very private grief, I find the most comforting thing is watching people fall apart together. I rewatched the last episode of Catastrophe this week. When it aired in early 2019, critics rightfully raved about the final scene, a poetic encapsulation of the couple’s relationship at a point when every possible thing has gone wrong. But this time around it was a throwaway line at the start that struck me. Sharon has just got off a long-haul flight and says: “I’m so tired I could cry.” Then Rob turns to her with a broad smile and says: “Well put on your sunglasses and cry!” Life may have irrevocably changed and I don’t know what’s to come, but I’m so happy I have someone around to pass me my sunnies and tell me to cry."
"“Look, the first three episodes are complete trash. Push through those though, and if you like it after that, you’ll love it.” This is something I have said about the science fiction series The 100 approximately the same number of times over the past five years. Without fail, a few days later I receive a message that says some variation of: “Ugh, fine, it isn’t bad.” Then about a week after that: “I can’t stop watching this show. How is it this good?” I know that now doesn’t seem like exactly the right moment to talk up a show all about a nuclear apocalypse that has rendered Earth unliveable, but please bear with me. It’s worth it. In classic sci-fi form, The 100 is set in the not-too-distant future. All that remains of the human race is a small colony living on The Ark, a space station orbiting Earth. The idea is that humans will live there, die there, and reproduce there until Earth becomes inhabitable again. Life on The Ark is harsh: all crimes are met with capital punishment, food is limited, and worst of all it’s running out of air. So the decision is made to send 100 of the population’s juvenile delinquents down to Earth years earlier than planned. If they survive, great, everyone else can follow. If not, well, more air for those who remain. With the series about to enter its seventh and final season, you can take an educated guess at how well that goes. The show – once you push past the first three episodes – is like if Lord of the Flies were crossed with Firefly then reimagined as a soap opera. Also, as an added bonus, for an American show filmed in Canada it is very Australian. The cast has a surprisingly large number of Neighbours and Home and Away alumni, including Eliza “Janae Timmins” Taylor and Bob “my teenage self’s favourite actor on Home and Away” Morley. As the teenagers navigate a new world and tackle the challenges of both a hostile environment and essentially having to construct their own society from scratch, the writers are able to probe topics of real depth. On The Ark everything was punitive. Take extra food – get executed. Have more than one child – get executed. What, if anything, does this group of teens owe the people left back at their former home? Across the seasons The 100 digs into more complex territory. How can you decide if one life is worth more than another? Do you protect your own people at all costs? And then, just when you think it is all too real and feel the escapism of the show starting to get away from you, a giant mutant gorilla thing bursts through the jungle so unexpectedly that you can’t help but laugh. Or you remember that the first episode featured someone saying, in earnest, “We’re back, bitches!” and everything is alright again. It’s the perfect balance of dark and light. The 100 makes you ask big questions like: does being a strong leader mean giving up part of your humanity? And at the same time makes you ask practical questions like: where is everyone getting shampoo and blowouts? And with all this boning, why isn’t everyone constantly pregnant? We have our own apocalypse to worry about right now, so why watch a show that is basically all about surviving the end of the world? Well, I could happily give you a hundred reasons, but I think the most compelling one is this: it’s just very good television that will completely draw you in. It lets you think about important issues while keeping the real world at arm’s length. It’s deep without being grim, and fun without being flippant. Filled with cliffhangers (sometimes literally), interpersonal dramas and the occasional gut-punch of a plot twist, it’s an intelligently crafted, completely engrossing series that somehow manages to distract you from the world’s problems by being all about the world’s problems."
"It was a big political news day on Tuesday as the de facto Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate, a position Trevor Noah called “America’s assistant manager”. The 55-year-old Democratic senator from California becomes the first black woman and woman of Indian descent on a major party ticket for national office. “Say what you want about Joe, but the man went black and he’s not going back,” the Daily Show host said, adding that he’s impressed Biden picked Harris after she “destroyed” him in Democratic debates. “Part of me thinks he only picked her so that she could just never dust his ass in public again. This isn’t a VP pick; it’s an insurance policy.” Jokes aside, Noah said, the selection of the first black woman on a major party ticket is a “great moment for her and for America”. Noah also zoomed in on Trump’s sabotaging of the post office, an American institution critical to holding a fair election in November. The president has attacked mail-in voting in tweets and interviews, and efforts to undermine the service have extended to regular mail delivery; Noah cited news clips reporting on the massive mail backlog in post offices across the country, which workers attribute to major changes enacted by the new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, a top Republican donor. The consequences are already dire, Noah explained: “A lot of people think that mail is just a waste of paper, credit cards that they’re not going to sign up for and ads for shit that they’re not gonna buy, but for many, many people, that’s how they get their medicine. It’s how they communicate with family members in prison, and in many areas of the country, especially rural areas, the post office is the only way they can receive mail. “So the mail might mean nothing to you, but it means everything to some people.” Given the reports, it’s clear, Noah concluded, that “unless Trump changes his mind on the post office, just like every other Trump business, it could be doomed.” Joe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate marks some significant firsts: the first black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated on a major party ticket, which means “Trump’s gonna have a hard time deciding exactly how to be racist about her,” said Stephen Colbert. The Late Show host called Harris a “surprising” choice given how “she hit him so hard he was spitting teeth like Chiclets” during the Democratic debates last year. Regardless, Harris is “going to receive a lot of scrutiny,” Colbert continued, because Biden has promised to be a “transition” candidate of one term and “has a chronic condition doctors call ‘old’”. And on Late Night, Seth Meyers broke down a “Friday night massacre” that has gutted the US Postal Service. Last week, the USPS announced a dramatic restructuring of the department which would center power around the postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, a Trump appointee who has up to $75m invested in the post office’s competitors. The blatant conflict of interest is “like finding out the new president of Peta is the colonel”, said Meyers. It’s also “suspicious”, he added, for Trump to appoint a big-money Republican businessman to run a non-partisan, generally beloved agency – “it’s like if your town ice cream man was replaced by Karl Rove”. More sinister are the implications of a backed-up postal service for the national election this fall, especially when 32 states discard late ballots even if they’re post-marked in time. “Whether or not Trump actually succeeds in stopping mail-in voting is almost beside the point,” said Meyers. “Either way, he’s sowing confusion, setting up lengthy court battles, and laying the groundwork to claim the results are disputed even if they’re not. “Trump is openly trying to disrupt timely delivery of the mail ahead of a November election that will almost certainly rely on an unprecedented surge in mail-in balloting because of the deadly plague he failed to stop,” Meyers concluded. Meanwhile, DeJoy has announced operational changes amid reports of chronic understaffing and major delays – weeks or more – in mail delivery. The undermining of the postal service isn’t accidental, Meyers argued, since “Trump knows that if we have a safe and fair election in which everyone can freely participate, he has no chance.”"
"Britain has never been good at drive-ins. Historically our cars have been too small for comfort and unsuitable for making out. At British drive-ins the answer to the question, “Is that a gear stick, or are you just pleased to see me?” has always been, “It’s the gear stick.” This summer things are going to change. Now you’ve watched everything on Netflix, written a terrible novel and made a matchstick replica of the Hagia Sophia, you’re looking for a cultural fix beyond the front door. The answer? Follow Boris Johnson’s injunction to support the economy by driving to Newark show ground next month for what’s billed as the UK’s first drive-in music festival. It could be like Glastonbury with air-con. True, you’ll be despoiling the planet just to get there, and, yes, the 10-day festival involves tribute acts impersonating Take That, Elton John, Billy Joel, Abba, the Killers and Elvis from a giant stage whose audio is pumped through your vehicle’s speakers, while you take receipt of street food from staff in PPE.  Is hand jiving to Dancing Queen from inside a stationary Ford Focus on your bucket list? Mine neither. Yet Steve Marson from organisers Nightflix (see what they did there?) looks forward to proving me wrong: “We are delighted to be in a position where we can offer a safe form of entertainment to the public while practising social distancing.” Up and down the country, drive-ins are opening as canny entrepreneurs see a business opportunity. It’s going out but staying in at the same time, and only a cynic (that’ll be me) would suggest it combines the worst of both. Cinemas, concert halls, theatres, galleries and standup gigs are closed, festivals abandoned. And yet we yearn for live art and entertainment. Hence recent drive-in gigs at an airport in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and at a car park in Bratislava, Slovakia. Across the world, people are leaving lockdown, getting into their cars and chasing down what passes for live culture at this difficult time while still socially distancing. This would have looked like a world gone nuts to 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal, who wrote: “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” But what did Pascal know? He never parked his Vauxhall Tigra at a race track outside Bratislava repurposed as a hip-hop drive-in and wigged out (while responsibly upholding social distancing parameters), as young Slovakians did earlier this month. Hence, too, what is billed as the world’s first drive-in comedy gig in Glasgow. “Buy a ticket for Rotunda Drive-In,” goes the blurb, “and we will give you a parking space, a pizza, and access to our show feed, which you will hear via your smartphone Bluetoothed to your car stereo. You will also be able to see the comics on our stage or on your phone.” A ticket for a standard car containing two people is £30 and £10 more for each extra passenger, while if you want to park your car at the VIP front section, it’ll set you back £80. How do you heckle? Flash headlights or horn honks in morse code?  From late July to September, Live Nation and energy company Utilita will be hosting a drive-in concert series at 12 venues, including racecourses, airports and Bolton Wanderers football ground. Talent includes Ash, Lightning Seeds, the Streets, Tony Hadley and Ealing’s leading contribution to acid funk, the Brand New Heavies. “We we believe the drive-in format is a thoughtful and fun way to safely bring one million Brits out of entertainment lockdown,” says promoter Peter Taylor. Bring folding chairs if you want to sit in the designated area around your car and enjoy images from hi-definition LED screens and what is billed as concert-quality sound from the live stage. The first drive-in opened in New Jersey in 1933 and by 1958, the peak year for the phenomenon, there were 4,063 across America. Today, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Association, there are only 305 drive-ins and 549 screens in the US. By contrast, Britain’s first outdoor cinema company, Luna, only opened in 2007, and what is thought to be Britain’s only permanent drive-in, Route 66, opened in Manchester in 2012. As that name suggests, the business model of the British drive-in has mostly involved plundering 50s Americana. This summer, for instance, an outfit called @thedrivein will, the blurb says, offer “a retro experience with a modern touch”. Waiters on roller skates will bring snacks ordered online through a mobile app to “a drop-off point by your car”. In that retro context it’s hardly surprising that Grease – one of the movies @thedrivein will show – is a staple of the British drive-in. In one scene in that movie, lubricious bad boy Danny (John Travolta) puts the moves on prissy good girl Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) at a drive-in as they recline in a superb convertible fitted with an automatic transmission the better to facilitate, you’d think, in-movie legovers. Outraged, Sandy climbs out, denounces Danny’s “sin wagon” and slams the door on his genitals. Thus was American drive-in culture pastiched in 1978. And thus, reheated, it is served up again to us in 2020. It’s going to be a summer of drive-in firsts. Here comes a sentence I never thought I’d write. Britain’s first ever drive-in, red-carpet premiere will take place at Brent Cross, London, on 22 July. While I feel about Brent Cross the way Elvis Costello felt about Chelsea, the movie in question, Break, sounds like a riot. The blurb describes it as a life-affirming Britflick about an inner city kid (Sam Gittins) wasting his life on drugs and knife crime until he meets a former pool champ played by David Yip, and a tough club owner interpreted by Rutger Hauer in his last screen appearance, in a movie that involves a prestigious snooker tournament in Beijing. I’ll be donning my face mask and catching the 210 bus across London , if only to see the socially distanced talent strutting on that red carpet. Only Britain would carpet a drive-in at a grim shopping centre off the ring road and pass off the event as glamorous. The premiere is organised by the Drive-in Club, which is also putting on other film screenings and comedy gigs both in Brent Cross and in Dagenham, east London, during the summer. Shappi Khorsandi, Reginald D Hunter, Adam Kay, Bill Bailey and Rachel Parris are confirmed to perform, while socially distanced children will be entertained by Rastamouse and Basil Brush. Whether comedy can work with the audiences in their cars remains to be seen. The risk is it will be, like the premiership without fans, a spooky experience for all involved – and not in a good way. A few miles round the north circular, London’s Alexandra Palace will host the world’s first drive-in opera in September, meeting a demand that had occurred to literally no one before lockdown. “I miss seeing my mates close up, and I miss seeing something live,” Stuart Murphy, chief executive of English National Opera told the Guardian. “Hopefully, we can offer that universal, collective experience in a safe environment.” Shortened versions of the Mozart’s Magic Flute and Puccini’s La Bohème have been programmed. Fingers crossed it will change stuffy opera etiquette: at a drive-in, if you want to sing along to Your Tiny Hand is Frozen as the pasty maiden on stage pegs out to consumption, who is going to stop you? Happily, too, the Ally Pally drive-in opera will admit audience members on motorbikes and bicycles rather than, as some other drive-ins do, excluding them, in a sickening new form of cultural apartheid. Given that bicycle sales have soared during lockdown while demand for cars has plummeted, surely the two-wheel demographic could be much more lucratively exploited. A push-bike-only festival of Ida Lupino movies and German expressionist classics is what we need, ideally with customers allowed to be accompanied by one well-behaved dog in a wicker basket. For the terrible truth behind Britain’s looming lockdown drive-in summer is that it will meet demand only by adding to traffic congestion and pollution levels that have been predicted to soar as lockdown restrictions are eased. Several cities, including Wuhan and Stockholm, have seen truck and car use rise above their pre-coronavirus levels. But let’s park, not just our cars, but our cynicism. Drive-ins, creatively reimagined, can be culturally nourishing. In Toronto, for instance, there is something called Gogh By Car. Visitors drive into the industrial space that once held the Toronto Star’s printing presses, turn off their engines and experience huge light projections of Van Gogh artworks, including Starry Night and Sunflowers. I suspect this idea could be further developed. Put your car into first gear and move through a digitised projection of – I’m spitballing here – exhibits from the British Museum’s recent Troy exhibition with audio supplied by Stephen Fry. At the end of the drive-through you’d pull up at the counter that doubles as gift shop and fast-food counter, pick up your pre-ordered mocha latte along with a Sulking Achilles terracotta plate (£115) and drive home, tired but happy. Clearly, there is scope for the drive-in experience to adapt further to our summer of strange. Bingo and silent discos are, for instance, being retrofitted even as I write by drive-in entrepreneurs such as @thedrivein as part of entertainment packages. It’s not clear yet whether this drive-in phenomenon is a cul de sac from which we will reverse later this year or a permanent change in the way we consume culture. But certainly the idea that Britain is belatedly becoming a drive-in nation is one of the more bizarre results of global pandemic. Meanwhile, next week in Los Angeles Garth Brooks will take the stage before a live audience of zero. “I am so excited to get to play again,” the country crossover star says from under his trademark big hat. “Back to what we LOVE to do!! Did you know you can’t spell FUN without G? HA!!” he tweeted recently. No, I don’t know what Garth’s on about either. His gig is to be relayed to 300 drive-ins across the US and Canada on 27 June. “This drive-in concert allows us all to get back to playing live music without the uncertainty of what would be the result to us as a community,” he says. “This is old school, new school, and perfect for the time we are in.” No doubt, but the fact that the gig will be accessible only in North American theatres points up the disappointing truth about globalisation in 2020. You can catch Covid-19 anywhere in the world but not yet Garth Brooks."
"If the idea of a “dream job” is a myth, the employees at indie record store Empire Records didn’t get that memo. For them – self-identifying misfits and weirdos, prone to petty crime – the shop floor was a place where obeying societal norms didn’t count for much. It’s 1995 in Delaware, US, an era in which music was becoming increasingly commodified with the rise of CD sales, and placing celebrities on a Swarovski crystal pedestal was considered the norm. Inevitably, everything that was once good and sacred about music fandom was under threat. The film turns 25 this year and it’s having a moment. A cinematic underdog that bombed on release, it’s now a respected cultural touchstone. It’s not just a heady dose of nostalgia for an era where dancing on rooftops or singing along with the Cranberries was normal. It’s also grown into a go-to comfort watch for a generation who might need to remember the value of being understood over betraying their sense of self for a bit of easy cash and glory. The plot follows a day in the life of a gang of teenaged staff as they realise that their place of work is being sold to a soulless corporate giant. Gambling money away in Atlantic City and an in-store event for a one-hit wonder isn’t helping the crisis. Not willing to give up without a fight, they decide to put on a raging street party for the neighbourhood. Their grand plan? Take back power by raising the money to save their beloved record store. The film gestures towards the tropes of a workplace comedy, without veering too far into the modern-day bureaucracy of Parks and Recreation or the subtle indignities of service work in Party Down. At Empire Records, time stopped and customers were willing to wait out major life crises or call back again after team bonding activities wrapped up. For a film about fandom, not everyone in the industry understood the appeal. Critic Roger Ebert famously gave the film a terrible review during its initial theatrical release. He confidently wrote it off as a 1.5-star-rated “lost cause” but (rightfully) predicted that the entire cast had better projects ahead of them. Empire’s store manager (Anthony LaPaglia) went on to win a Golden Globe. The wild child who wants to sing in a band (Renée Zellweger) went on to star in Jerry Maguire. The Harvard-bound good-girl-turned-celebrity-scandal (Liv Tyler) matured into an elf maiden in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. And risk-taking gambler and manager-in-training (Rory Cochrane) went on to a bigger part in another cult hit, Dazed and Confused. Based on screenwriter Carol Heikkinen’s real-life experiences of working at global music franchise Tower Records (which filed for bankruptcy in 2006, nearly a decade after the film’s release), Empire Records serves as a rare and beautiful time capsule. It’s a homage to an era in which every important moment in your teenage life was worthy of a thoughtfully selected soundtrack; where starting a band could make you a new person; when shaving your head and asking your team to stage your live funeral was an act of devoted friendship; when committing larceny was fine if you were saving what you loved; and music was listened to in a soundproof booth with headphones on, rather than streamed as a service. This isn’t to say the film doesn’t have its flaws. When the cast interacts outside of the store, there’s often a lack of chemistry. And somehow, in hindsight, it seems problematic that the entire trajectory of their lives depends on whether the store remains open for business. But what saves this film is its unselfconsciously optimistic, goofy, principled spirit. Empire Records was about seeing the silver lining even in the most terrible, scrape-the-bottom-of-the-barrel times, forming unlikely friendships and finding family at work, challenging the financial security and mediocrity of signing on the dotted line and “selling out”, and riding out the highs and lows of an industry in its doom-and-gloom phase. Empire Records was a place where even the odd shoplifter who wandered in wanted to work: sure, it wasn’t a fast-track to becoming a tech billionaire, and a night in Vegas would probably lead to you being handcuffed on the couch. But you had a boss who kicked out predatory pop stars to protect his employees, and colleagues who fostered an environment in which mental health was discussed openly and non-judgmentally (for the most part). With the rallying cry of “Damn the man, save the Empire!”, a generation of new fans crops up every few years or so, reminding us that it’s better to follow through on our dreams than give it all up for someone else’s."
"When an inebriated Antony Costa from Blue urinated on a cash machine outside a post office near Covent Garden. He was stood up for that, and I did laugh. The cash machine is no longer there but I believe that’s unrelated to the aforementioned piddling. The one of Kate Winslet’s boobs in Titanic always makes me chuckle because I don’t know who it is he’s sketching but it looks naff all like Kate Winslet. The diaries of Edwina Currie make for a good read. The disappointment on display on the Antiques Roadshow never fails to raise a smile, and I imagine I’m not alone when I say that. I used to have a Chanel (-inspired) two-piece suit and the fabric boasted a print featuring Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts, and I used to enjoy standing in front of people and declaring: “You know me, I’ll wear ALL SORTS,” to everyone’s amusement, and it never got old. For some reason whenever I see the words “lamb shank” on a menu I burst out laughing. Do you know, last night I dreamed I was on Coronation Street! I mention it not because it’s funny but because Corrie’s casting directors might read this. As a woman with a past life as a bingo caller I can tell you that it is and always will be “69”.

"Trying to pick the 10 funniest things on the internet is harder than trying to come up with an appropriate analogy for how hard it is to pick the 10 funniest things on the internet: damn near impossible. But I have tried. I’ve also tried to keep things as PG as I can, because some of the funniest things on the internet are not safe for work. So I’ve been prevented from including anything to do with bodily fluids, which really dampens my style. I also want to give a special mention to two Netflix shows, Maria Bamford’s masterpiece, Lady Dynamite, and the funniest sketch show in a decade, I Think You Should Leave. Both are technically “on the internet” and are among the funniest things I’ve seen in years but I can’t pick one single moment or put both whole series in here. So watch them. Anyway, here’s my funny things in no particular order. Cool 3D World is what I need. It’s a cold pint of lager on a 42C day. It’s a hot cup of mulled wine while sitting beside a fireplace. It’s clean sheets on a freshly made bed. It’s what makes me feel like this nonsense hellscape of existence is actually OK. When I watch it I feel like weeping with joy and I never want to look away. All the videos are masterpieces but what I feel was a true coming-of-age for the channel, and one of the most revered works in its hallowed history, would have to be Men in Chairs. This is a classic from the most prestigious fake news network on the internet. Good luck to you, Nancy, I hope you got some sleep. Look, everybody knows about Between Two Ferns. It’s a hit. You know it and I know it. But at the end of the day this is a funniest things list. I can lie to you and say that this isn’t one of the funniest web series I’ve ever seen, but I’M NOT A LIAR! I SPEAK THE TRUTH! When this came out it was everything and I watched every episode. I loved it. And you did too. It’s hard to pick a favourite but I love this because it’s one of the rare times the guest flipped the interview back on Zach Galifianakis. Charlize is so funny in this and this is great. I don’t know if I’ve heard anyone referenced more in TV writing rooms than Philomena Cunk. She is a perfect character, and the archetype for satirical infotainment that we all aspire to be. It’s difficult to choose a standout – her segment on Time for Charlie Brooker’s Weekly Wipe is frequently cited as her best work – but here’s one of my faves. Aunty Donna are Australia’s best sketch group and need no introduction. So here’s my new favourite: Filling up on Cheese Before Dinner. It’s well known that political satire was rendered obsolete on 9 November 2016. Even four years after the election of Donald Trump, I continue to be shocked by what his supporters say and do on a daily basis. I had to really investigate whether DeAnna Lorraine is a real person or a troll, because this is too good. And, frankly, she looks legit. This is a video of Trump drinking a glass of water and the crowd cheering for blood, clipped up and shared by a woman claiming that it destroys the “degenerate left”. Everything about this is hilarious. I think. I mean I have to laugh at this otherwise the depression will wash over me like a thick gravy over rare roast beef. This might be unfair because Sam is my friend and maybe I’m not being objective, but also he is a multi-award winner and critically acclaimed so I reckon I’m safe. Sam is basically the best comic in Australia and this is a clip from the funniest show I’ve ever seen. Graham is an example of how the road to evil is paved with good intentions. In 2016 the Transport Accident Commission Victoria decided it wanted to raise awareness about road safety. A noble goal, to be sure, but somewhere along the way it veered from that path and created hell on this earth; a Lovecraftian nightmare known only as Graham. Graham is supposed to be what a human might look like if that human could survive a motor vehicle accident. But Graham survives more than car crashes, he survives in the nether regions of your mind. He survives in your darkest nightmares and he won’t ever let you go. Graham was created by Patricia Piccinini, who also created the terror known as the Skywhale, and I think there’s no one else alive who could get away with putting so many nipples on a government-sponsored work. WHY DOES HE HAVE SO MANY NIPPLES THOUGH? WHAT IS THE SAFETY ASPECT?? In the same vein as Graham, the Census Cowboy is another, more recent government initiative that boggles the mind. What does a cowboy have to do with the census? Who is this for? Who in the frozen, northern metropolis of Chicago is really into westerns and jamming out to Old Town Road? What exactly does this have to do with Batman other than they are both men wearing unusual outfits? Why is it a bad thing when the Census Cowboy visits you? Is he going to hurt you? This is fresh content and it is good. And finally, on the theme of cowboys, I want to take you to a place in your imagination. Imagine what it would be like if one day you found yourself crouching on all fours, strapping a saddle to your waist and waiting for your sugar-filled child to slowly wriggle up on to your back. Imagine feeling little Janey or Jimmy using their heels to kick you in the ribs so you would bounce around faster as they squealed “Pony up, Daddy!” Imagine what it would feel like to know that you simply had nothing left. Nothing left to hope for, no dreams left to dream. You’re a horsey now. Your bubby’s big horsey and that’s all you’ll ever be. Well, imagine no more! Here’s Pony Up Daddy!"
"Carriageworks has a clear path towards recovery after creditors voted unopposed on Tuesday for a proposal to rescue the arts company with the support of philanthropists and the New South Wales government, but not everyone is happy with the deal. The multi-arts institution in Sydney’s inner-west went into administration on 4 May after suffering an “irreparable” loss of income following the shutdown of non-essential services in NSW due to the coronavirus crisis. Carriageworks owed more than $2m to more than 140 creditors, including many individual artists and small arts companies. Despite those creditors voting on Tuesday to save the company, some who spoke to Guardian Australia expressed concern about the financial blows that were ultimately falling on the shoulders of those smaller players, who would receive a fraction of the amount they were owed by Carriageworks – even in the case of its rescue. Since their appointment, administrators Phil Quinlan and Morgan Kelly from KPMG had been strongly pushing for creditors to agree to a deed of company arrangement (DOCA) rather than opt for liquidation. The DOCA relied upon pledged contributions from philanthropists – including Geoff Ainsworth and his wife Johanna Featherstone, Kerr Neilson, Michael Gonski and the Packer Family Foundation – that were contingent upon the security of a long-term lease of Carriageworks’ Eveleigh premises and funding from the NSW government. Since 2017, Carriageworks has been operating on a month-by-month lease at the historic Eveleigh rail yards. The company, which has a number of resident arts organisations, subleases the premises from Create NSW, which in turn leases it from Transport NSW. The insecurity of the leasing arrangement, and Create NSW’s failure to commit to a funding timetable for Carriageworks’ multi-year support, were key factors in the company’s collapse. In June, the second meeting of creditors was suspended until Tuesday this week to give the administrators more time to secure assurances from the government on these issues. Newly reinstated NSW minister for the arts, Don Harwin, announced on 10 July that the government had agreed to these terms. The DOCA allows for priority employees to be paid their entitlements in full, while unsecured creditors – many of which are individual artists and arts companies – are expected to receive an estimated 20-30% of what they are owed. While they would have received nothing in the case of liquidation, early estimates suggested the individuals and organisations owed money by the company would receive between 25% and 37% of the outstanding sums in the event that a DOCA was approved. However, some members of the arts community are frustrated that the administrative timeline had blown out – that as negotiations to secure the lease agreement and funding from Create NSW dragged on, the administrators’ high fees ate into assets that would have otherwise been dispersed to creditors. Visual artist Rafaela Pandolfini told Guardian Australia that small to medium companies were forfeiting disproportionately large sums in order for the Carriageworks to reopen. “We are one of the greatest financiers of Carriageworks moving forward so why don’t we also have a substantial say in how it will be run when it returns?” Pandolfini said. “I would like to see Carriageworks acknowledge this disastrous effect on the artistic community and remodel.” She also called for a greater focus on diversity, equal pay structures across the organisation, and “sustained pay and support to the artists involved in their programs rather than the gig economy”. “It was another financial blow that was not necessary,” another creditor told Guardian Australia on condition of anonymity. “We are excited that Carriageworks is coming back, but I don’t think people understand what that means for us as creditors. So many of us have lost work already.” The NSW government stepping forward on the DOCA proposal and agreeing to the lease and funding in a timely manner “would have been a really simple way to get money into the pockets of the arts workers. We’re all quite disappointed about that.” “When you see these announcements about Carriageworks you don’t think about the people who actually are bearing the cost of it,” the creditor said. “Arts workers are in a crappy position anyway. This blow was avoidable.” “We are both conscious and embarrassed that creditors have been disadvantaged,” chair of the Carriageworks board, Cass O’Connor, told Guardian Australia. “The arts communities feel quite vulnerable, and people are concerned that other organisations are teetering. Everyone’s worried about that and it’s completely justified.” She said the philanthropists backing the company’s renewal, particularly Geoff Ainsworth and Jo Featherstone, were “very keen that we were more generous than usual to the creditors involved, because many of those creditors were from the arts community”. “We wanted to pay as much as we humanly could, while also raising enough money to go into the future activities of the company and precinct. It is a balancing act,” O’Connor said. “We were frustrated at some of the delays. We – along with the creditors, and frankly, KPMG – were very frustrated that the second meeting had to be extended. KPMG were very upfront about what that would mean. From my viewpoint, this certainly wasn’t a fee gouge by KPMG.” The administrators will hand back the company to its directors in the next seven days, with public operations expected to resume in the coming months, beginning with the reopening of the farmers’ market in August. O’Connor said a key plank of the new sustainable business plan, approved by the parties involved in the DOCA, was a funding buffer to guard against further downturns, such as if Sydney was to experience another lockdown. In a statement on Tuesday, Carriageworks chief executive Blair French thanked those who had lent their support to the institution since it went into administration. “The risk of closure gave rise to a most extraordinary expression of community support that gave great heart to everyone involved with Carriageworks,” he said. “We recognise the impact of this process upon our staff, artists, suppliers, farmers’ market producers and audiences and look forward to re-engaging all our stakeholders as we re-emerge with renewed confidence and strength into what remains an operational environment constrained by Covid-19.”  "
"When confronted with a crisis, said Trevor Noah on Thursday’s Daily Show, Trump has a standard pattern of moves – he’s like a “video game character” in his predictability: “First, he pretends the problem doesn’t exist, then he pretends he’s already solved the problem, and if that doesn’t work, he blames the media and the Democrats for the problem he probably created.” But none of these deflections have worked with coronavirus, Noah continued, and so on Tuesday, for the return of his daily White House briefing on coronavirus, Trump “pulled out his superpower: changing his tone”. In other words, after months of rejecting face masks and downplaying the virus, Trump (mostly) read a prepared statement in which he acknowledged the pandemic “will get worse before it gets better”. “It is actually a little scary to hear Trump talk like this,” Noah admitted. “Because when a scientist says it, it’s because those are the facts. When Trump says it, it’s because reality is so awful that it’s somehow cut through the thousands of layers of paranoid delusion. Like you know shit is bad when even Trump breaks character.” Whatever the reason for the sudden shift in “strategy” – sinking polls, a disastrous interview on the usually friendly Fox News – “it should be obvious to anyone with a memory better than a goldfish that this change of tone isn’t actually a sincere change of heart,” Noah said. “Because, let’s just say, we’ve all been here before.” Noah played a series of news clips which focused on Trump’s “dramatic shift in tone”, his “sobering sense”, when he read another prepared statement in mid-March. “We’ve seen this trick before, people,” Noah concluded. “Trump decides to pretend he’s taking coronavirus seriously again, and then two days later he’s doing what? He’s tweeting that it’s all a hoax and we should just eat our cereal with bleach. “So if the past is any indication, Trump’s somber new tone is as real as his skin tone. Because deep down, no matter how much he wants to hide it, he’s still Trump.” Stephen Colbert also covered Trump’s return to the coronavirus briefing, in which the president boasted that “we are in the process of developing a strategy that is going to be very, very powerful.” “Wait, you finally have a strategy, and your strategy is to develop a strategy?” the Late Show host retorted. “Well now we know why you never wear a mask, because all you care about is covering your ass. “You don’t get credit for a thing you should’ve done half a year ago,” Colbert added. Newfound “serious” tone aside, Trump insisted on using the racist nickname “China virus” for the disease during the briefing. “OK, sure, the virus came from China, but the country you govern leads the world in the number of cases and deaths,” Colbert said. “Calling it the China virus doesn’t make you less responsible for totally blowing the response here. That’s like blaming Mexico for getting your ding-dong stuck in a bottle of Tequila.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers lamented how major news networks reacted to Trump’s briefing, in that they “fell for this act simply because his team dosed his Diet Coke with Nyquil and got him to read a prepared statement pretending to take the crisis seriously”. ABC, for example, wrote “the president is displaying a new tone and a new level of engagement.” CNN called Trump expressed a “relatively sober tone”, while Bloomberg said: “Trump reboots virus briefings with warning and a shift in tone.” “Good Lord, I really think you could duct-tape a spatula to a golden retriever’s paw and half of the media would say, ‘Oh my God! That dog’s a chef.’” Meyers said. “What’s wrong with you guys? How can you keep falling for this? It’s been five years of this BS and still, every time President Werewolf over here manages to Novocaine his way through a prepared statement without passing out at the podium, you act like he’s a totally different person all of a sudden.” And on Full Frontal, Samantha Bee took a state-by-state tour of Covid-19 government malpractice called “Deniers, Dimwits, and Lies”. First stop: Georgia, whose governor, Brian Kemp, banned city and county governments from mandating the wearing of masks. “Brian fucking Kemp, you absolute nob,” said Bee. “I wish we never didn’t elect you,” a reference to the voter purge scandal just before his election over Stacey Abrams in 2018, when Kemp was in charge of overseeing the election as Georgia’s secretary of state. Bee also visited Arizona, the state with one of the highest Covid-19 infection rates in the nation this summer, where Governor Doug Ducey refused to mandate face masks, and barred cities and counties from imposing any stricter measures. “It’s not surprising that Arizona would drag its feet on mandating masks,” said Bee. “After all, in 1992, it became one of the last states to make Martin Luther King Day an official holiday, nine years after the US government. I know that seems racist, but you’ve gotta remember: it’s a dry hate.”"
"Andrew Clements, in criticising the Proms’ virtual orchestra as “trivial”, is missing the point (Opening night of the virtual Proms – archive treasures and a trite mash-up, 17 July). By involving 350 professional orchestral musicians, recording themselves individually at home, Iain Farrington has provided them with some paid work. The result was a tribute to the skill and professionalism of all involved. We are lucky to have such musicians in this country and they deserve support and appreciation. Perhaps the decision to include more recent performances from the archive in this year’s programme rather than from the 1960s will also provide much-needed help to musicians facing uncertain futures.Wendy StaalBridport, Dorset  The Southbank Centre warns of 400 redundancies; Birmingham’s Town Hall and Symphony Hall are set to lose half their staff; the Wales Millennium Centre is discussing 250 redundancies.

"Who is Helen Mirren? Looking back over her career, as she hits 75, it is tempting to see her as two separate people. First, there was the outspoken young classical actor who fiercely resisted objectification, whether from newspapers (“Stratford’s very own sex queen” was a notorious Sunday Times headline) or TV chatshow hosts. Then came the mature Mirren with a gift for playing monarchs (Elizabeth I on TV, Elizabeth II on screen and stage), for picking up every award going, and for being a great dame associated with excellent causes. Among many, she is an ambassador for Women International. Yet I see no great gulf between the two Mirrens. Having followed her career for 50 years, several things strike me. One is that she has always been a dedicated, highly skilled actor. Another is that she is a perennial mix of the nomadic and the majestic: you don’t get to play Cleopatra, as she did for the National Youth Theatre when she was 20, without some inbuilt imperiousness. Indeed, one of my few brief encounters with her took place around that time, when I went to a party hosted by one of her Youth Theatre contemporaries. My abiding memory is of a self-possessed young woman who made many of the men at the party feel like boys (and I, for one, was five years older). Where does that confidence come from? You could argue that it is partly genetic. It is well-known that she was born Helen Mironoff and that her paternal grandfather was a Russian aristocrat who fought in the tsar’s army and who was negotiating an arms deal in Britain when he and his family were stranded by the 1917 revolution. One can make too much of this, but it is fascinating how many of the great British actors have foreign ancestry. John Gielgud’s stockbroker father came from a Slav family and Peggy Ashcroft’s mother was part Danish, part German-Jewish. I suspect, in Mirren’s case, that her bloodline is significant. It’s no accident that, when she was at the Royal Shakespeare Company, Trevor Nunn referred to her as a “Russian princess”, or that one of her biggest TV hits was as the empress Catherine the Great. Yet within the aristocratic Mirren there has always been an adventurer up for any challenge. From 1967 to 71, she was a key member of the RSC, playing – among many other roles – Shakespeare’s Cressida and Ophelia, as well as Strindberg’s Miss Julie. With a classical career beckoning, she then upped sticks and went to Paris to join Peter Brook’s newly founded International Centre for Theatre Research. Out of that came a journey to Africa in 1972, with Brook and a team of actors seeking to explore the origins of performance. The trip was rigorous and exhausting, but Brook paid tribute to Mirren’s improvisatory gifts. The basic performance tool was a carpet, and Brook has described how, one day in a village in northern Nigeria, “without warning this beautiful young actress jumped on to the carpet and twisted her body into a crumpled, limping, twisted hag”. She was so successful, in fact, that several distressed spectators rushed forward to help her. Mirren returned Brook’s admiration in a way that had unforeseen consequences. In 1974, I went to Paris to cover his opening production of Timon of Athens at Théâtre des Bouffes-du-Nord. My review ended up containing a plea for the British – at a time when the embryonic National Theatre and the RSC were facing endless crises – to rediscover some of the “empty space” simplicity of Brook. To my astonishment, Mirren wrote to the Guardian endorsing my view and suggesting that the expenditure on sets and costumes at our national companies was “excessive, unnecessary and destructive to the art of theatre”. Her letter opened up a big debate and even led to a question in parliament. What was extraordinary was that she wrote it as she was playing Lady Macbeth on the Stratford stage. Seemingly, however, she suffered no sanctions for her reckless candour. Although Mirren had by now done a good deal of film and television, it was still the stage that seemed her natural métier. It was a sign of her versatility that, in 1975, she played both a self-destructive rock star in David Hare’s Teeth’n’Smiles at the London’s Royal Court, and Nina in The Seagull in the West End. I wrote of her Nina that instead of presenting us, in the final act, with the usual depleted wraith, she “showed us a woman who has learned through suffering how to endure”. Back at the RSC, she also followed – not for the first time – in Ashcroft’s footsteps by playing Queen Margaret in Henry VI. I still remember her disdainful cry, as she viewed the chaos of civil broils: “Is THIS the government of Britain’s isle?” At the Royal Exchange in Manchester, she was also a stunning Duchess of Malfi: proud, sexy and impetuous. If today Mirren is known to most people through her work on screens large and small, I suspect a turning point came in 1991 with Prime Suspect, written by Lynda La Plante, in which Mirren played Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison. Watching the first episode again, I was struck by how big a breakthrough this was and how it confirms my impression of Mirren as someone who can simultaneously be steely and vulnerable. Mirren’s Tennison is determined, obsessive and constantly battling the oppressive institutional sexism of the police force, yet she also shows the private cost of forever having to prove her right to operate in a man’s world. Mirren did seven series of Prime Suspect and, while she has periodically returned to the stage, her fame now rests very much on film and TV. It would be tedious to list all her credits but it strikes me that, as when young, she is still a mix of the imperious and the adventurous. Take two of her performances as Elizabeth II. In 2006, she played the title role in The Queen. Stephen Frears, who directed the film, said that when casting the role “it seemed essential to have someone who made you nervous”. Although the movie is about the Queen’s annus horribilis, when the death of Princess Diana exposed her failure to catch the public mood, Mirren still suggests that the monarch’s aloofness is ultimately a source of strength. Mirren was back in royal robes in 2013 for Peter Morgan’s play The Audience. What impressed me was her capacity to convey the Queen’s mix of the extraordinary and the ordinary. She caught all of the monarch’s gift for adapting to a wide range of prime ministers: standing up to an ageing Winston Churchill, or smoking out the pretences of Anthony Eden during the Suez crisis. Yet Mirren also reminded us that virtually all plays about monarchy are studies of solitude: she gave us a woman who, for all her wealth and privilege, suffered a visible sense of entrapment. Dipping into the scores of recent Mirren movies, it seems to me that her qualities remain constant. She has the poise and serenity that comes with age but she also suggests inner resilience. Look at her in Hitchcock, playing Alma Reville, the wife of the director; or her vengeful mark to Ian McKellen’s conman in The Good Liar. Most fascinating of all is her role as Maria Altmann in Simon Curtis’s Woman in Gold, where she plays a woman seeking the restitution of a Klimt painting stolen from her family by the Nazis. She catches precisely the arrogance and impatience of an upper-class Austrian who will brook no argument. In fact, I was strongly reminded, yet again, of Peggy Ashcroft, who played a similarly authoritarian Austrian in a Stephen Poliakoff TV film, Caught on a Train. So who exactly is Helen Mirren? She is a fiercely committed, hard-working, hugely gifted actor equally at home on stage or screen. But I cling to my belief that, although she has developed and widened her range with age, she is not vastly different at 75 from the woman I first saw playing Cleopatra when she was 20."
"Two celebrated Manchester music venues have been rescued after new buyers stepped in promising to get them back up and running. Gorilla and the Deaf Institute had been about to close down as their operator, Mission Mars, struggled to deal with the effects of the Covid-19 lockdown. But Tokyo Industries, which operates dozens of venues, mainly in the north of England, has said it had agreed a deal last weekend to get them back to normal. “These are extremely difficult times for all grassroots music venues around the UK. It’s vital venues like Gorilla and the Deaf Institute are kept alive, the cultural fabric of our city centres depends venues like these,” said Aaron Mellor, the founder of Tokyo Industries. “Over the weekend, we’ve put together some great ideas with SSD Concerts and Tim Burgess [lead singer of alternative rock band The Charlatans] to help save both venues and their existing operating style in a post-Covid world. We’re not so keen on this ‘new’ normal and want to keep the ‘old’ normal alive for when we all get through this.” Burgess welcomed the news, tweeting: “Let’s work together to help save as many independent spaces as we can.” Mellor acknowledged that a “difficult few months” lay ahead, saying the businesses would not be viable until social distancing rule were removed. He said his firm had been given guidance from Whitehall that a decision was expected by early November and that it was likely the restrictions would be eased by the end of 2020. “Grassroots venues are already very difficult to run. We do this out of a love of new music,” he said. “Music will come back and a city like Manchester that is built on music will be back.” The incoming and outgoing owners on 21 July released a joint statement confirming news of the deal. They said all staff would be kept on and had been informed. “It’s really great news for our teams and the music-loving people of Manchester that both venues have found such a perfect new home,” said Roy Ellis, chief executive of Mission Mars. Gorilla and the Deaf Institute were among four well-known venues in Manchester and Hull threatened with closure. In Hull, two historic venues, the Welly and the Polar Bear, have gone into administration."
"Sometimes the only thing you can face to watch on television is a wholesome, heartwarming family show. When you find yourself in such a predicament, let me suggest Canadian series Kim’s Convenience: a charming, understated family dramedy that is the TV viewer’s equivalent of dating someone who is simply nice after a decade of dalliances with cool kids and bad boys. The show follows Canadian-Korean couple Mr and Mrs Kim (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee and Jean Yoon) and their adult children, Jung (Simu Liu) and Janet (Andrea Bang). The short, 20-minute episodes explore the Kims’ immigrant background and generational differences through the everyday ups and downs of running a convenience store while managing family life and faith. The script walks the line between empathy, caricature and secondhand awkwardness. For example, in one episode Mr Kim wants to call the police when a Toyota is parked in the no-parking zone. “How many times do I have you tell you,” Janet exasperatedly says to her dad, “Japanese people aren’t the only ones driving Japanese cars.” He puffs up and reminds her that Japan attacked Korea in 1910, a sentence she finishes because clearly that is an oft-repeated line in their household. It takes excellent writing and delivery to make scenes like this work without alienating viewers. Kim’s Convenience was created by Canadian-Korean playwright and screenwriter Ins Choi, who has said he drew inspiration from his own family for the TV series and the award-winning play it is based on. His father was a pastor and, growing up, many of Choi’s friends’ families owned convenience stores. Some of that experience makes its way into the show in forms that will be familiar to immigrants and people of colour: parents who use food to say they love you; younger generations being constantly tested to prove their allegiance to country and culture. But in other ways the show goes beyond stereotypes, taking the risk of showing rifts in the family – fractures that cannot be resolved by cooking together (like they might have been in, say, Crazy Rich Asians). As a teenager, Jung committed petty crimes and had a stint in juvenile detention. Mr Kim kicked him out of the house when he caught Jung stealing from him and they have remained estranged. Although Jung has a good relationship with his “Umma” and Janet, the four Kims take great pains to avoid an interaction between Jung and “Appa” (Mr Kim). In the first season, Janet tries to make up for her brother’s absence by living at home. When she moves out, she continues to work at the store and remains close to her parents. Although her mum tries to set her up with “cool Christian boys”, Janet is her own person and dates who she wants – even if they make for questionable choices. But the most loveable part of this series, for me, is that it shows Asian slackers and goofballs on western TV, which is part of a burgeoning pop culture trend (see My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Good Place). Too often, Asian characters are shown as one-dimensional high achievers. Instead, here, Jung is portrayed as attractive and charming but with limited ambition beyond his job in a car rental chain. (Liu, meanwhile, recently won the role of Marvel’s superhero Shang-Chi.) With its fantastic ensemble cast and funny, cringeworthy and complex storylines, Kim’s Convenience fuses the best of 80s sitcoms and real life."
"A day after the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden selected the California senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, Donald Trump attempted to tear her down – she’s “nasty”, he said in a press conference. “She was extraordinarily nasty, she was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing,” he said, “very, very nasty”. The “nasty” attacks were, as Stephen Colbert pointed out on Wednesday’s Late Show, deeply unoriginal. “How lazy are you?! You’re just repeating what you said about Hillary. You’re stuck in 2016! And that’s not fair – why should you be the only one who gets to live in a time when you’re not president?” The Trump campaign has experimented with calling her “phony Kamala” but is reportedly still “workshopping effective nicknames” to paint her as “ruthless” and “power-hungry”. “What a wonderful use of the commander in chief’s time,” Colbert deadpanned, imagining Trump as a Mean Girls character poring over his “burn book” instead of handling the coronavirus crisis. On a phone call with Fox News, Trump continued to drum up fear over Harris by calling her “the most dangerous choice” because “she’s the most liberal person supposedly in the Senate”. “What is he talking about?” Colbert marveled. “Harris is an establishment Democrat and a former prosecutor. It is so clear that Trump had a different set of opponents in mind and now he’s having trouble changing strategies.” Colbert also mocked the Trump campaign’s “clearly misogynist” attack on Harris as “power-hungry” and “overly ambitious”. “Of course she’s ambitious! She’s running for vice-president! Who does that without ambition?” Colbert said, pointing out that that nobody just “falls into” becoming the “second most powerful person in the world”. On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also dismissed Trump’s attempts to discredit Kamala Harris, starting with the president’s apparent confusion that Biden would choose a running mate who memorably challenged him in the primary debates. “Of all people, Donald Trump should totally understand how you can be with a woman who’s publicly humiliated you,” said Noah over a photo of Trump’s wife Melania. “He also shouldn’t be surprised that past enemies can become your friends,” Noah added, and listed off a number of Republican congressmen who have worked with Trump despite their blistering criticisms: Ted Cruz, who called him a “pathological liar and narcissist”; Lindsey Graham, who once said Trump was a “bigot and nutjob”; and Marco Rubio, who called him “a con artist”. Jokes aside, Noah called Biden’s decision to pick Harris – the first black female or south Asian candidate on a major party ticket, a moderate Democrat who once served as attorney general in California – a “genius move”, because “not only does she tick a bunch of boxes, but clearly, conservatives are going to struggle to put her in one”. Noah played a series of clips from Fox News in which conservative pundits struggled to demean her – she’s too telegenic, but also too ambitious, they said. The pick was surprising, then it was boring. She incarcerated too many people as California’s attorney general, but is too soft on crime. “Poor Republicans, they’re so confused,” Noah mocked. “Honestly, it’s kind of cute watching Republicans flail around trying to figure out the right talking points. It’s like when a litter of puppies is born but they haven’t opened their eyes yet.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon recapped Biden’s first appearance with his new running mate at an empty high school gym in Wilmington, Delaware. “That’s right, Biden and Harris shared a stage for the first time since the debates,” Fallon said. “You can tell Biden hasn’t forgotten, because when Harris went in for a handshake, he flinched.” Trump, meanwhile, labeled Harris with the unoriginal “nasty”, which shouldn’t be surprising, said Fallon – “unfortunately for Harris, if you want well wishes from Trump, you’ve gotta be in prison”. In other news, Trump called into Fox News to continue sowing undue fear about mail-in voting, claiming that “people are just going to grab batches of [mail-in ballots], you talk about China and Russia, they’ll be grabbing plenty of ’em”. “Usually when an old man starts accusing people of stealing the mail, it’s time to put grandpa down for his nap,” Fallon joked."
"As the schools tentatively reopen, there is no better time to revisit that most canonical of teen TV genres: the high school drama. A Marmite show, Ryan Murphy’s Glee rubbed some up the wrong way but nevertheless was manna for the musical theatre kids. The teen drama showcased the intertwining lives of high schoolers through song, and made stars of Darren Criss and Amber Riley. Netflix If the final season of Netflix’s documentary series Last Chance U has you hankering for more American football action, look no further than this high school sports drama. Centring on the Texan town of Dillon and its team, the show explores the tension of small-town attitudes through its ensemble cast. Amazon Prime (£) A refreshing recent take on the genre comes in the form of Laurie Nunn’s Sex Education, which transposes the cliques and conventions of the US high school to a British setting. It tells the story of awkward teen Asa Butterfield’s ascension in the social stakes after he dishes out advice cribbed from his sex therapist mum (Gillian Anderson). Netflix The east coast OC, this much-memed New York show deals heavily in melodrama, detailing the dramas of privileged Manhattanites as they have their secrets revealed by the mysterious blogging of the “gossip girl”. Look out for crush-worthy early performances from Blake Lively and Penn Badgley. Netflix The newest addition to the genre is a meta take on high school tropes as comics Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle, gamely starring as their 13-year-old selves in the year 2000, delve deep into the embarrassment of puberty. Expect acne, braces, boys and questionable fashion choices. Now TV A distinctly British and puerile vision of the high school comedy here, as we follow the (mis)fortunes of four suburban misfits – Will, Simon, Neil and Jay – as they navigate their burning desires for the opposite sex, awkward parental relationships and love/hate bonds with each other. All 4 From its theme tune to the tanned and eternally youthful cast, there is perhaps no other show that better encapsulates wealthy California than The OC. An early-2000s staple, this drama stars Ben McKenzie as troubled adopted teen Ryan, who must deal with the exclusive world of Orange County as he embarks on a romance with rebellious socialite Marissa (Mischa Barton). Amazon Prime Video In West Philadelphia born and raised was this fictionalised version of Will Smith, sent by his single mother to live with his uber-rich uncle Phil and Aunt Viv in Los Angeles’s exclusive Bel-Air neighbourhood where he attends a private school. It was the teatime sitcom that made Smith a star, showcasing his aptitude for goofy slapstick as well as landing weighty, emotional punches. Netflix On air for only one season before it was unceremoniously cancelled, this 1994 drama has since become something of a cult classic. Starring a fresh-faced Claire Danes as 15-year-old Angela and Jared Leto as her love interest Jordan, the show was radical at the time for frankly exploring issues such as homophobia and child abuse. Available on DVD It doesn’t always have to be gritty realism or mishap-fuelled comedy when it comes to high school – it can involve vampires, too. Joss Whedon’s fantasy sees Sarah Michelle Gellar as the latest in a long line of vampire slayers, protecting her neighbourhood while finding time for romance with Angel (David Boreanaz).

"Hello Naaman. Why is everyone on Twitter suddenly screaming “UNTITLED GEESE GAME!!!”?Hi Steph, don’t worry, those screams you’re hearing are honks of joy. The reason is simple: instead of one goose, there are two. Untitled Goose Game has added a second goose. The geese are leese!! What are you talking about? What is Untitled Goose Game?You call yourself a culture editor?? We’ve only written around seven different articles on it – including two different reviews, a behind-the-scenes feature on “how they laid the golden egg”, another feature on how it was made, and there was also an incredibly abstract reference to its art style in a comic about Premier League managers. The Australian-made indie game is a huge worldwide smash, and we’ve never been prouder. If you search “Guardian goose”, our review of Untitled Goose Game is the sixth result – after the Wikipedia article for “guard goose” (“The guard goose is a domestic goose that is utilised as a guard animal both on farms and in other situations.”) OK yes I have heard of it. I have simply never played it.In the game – which was created by Melbourne’s House House, and can be played on PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4 and Xbox One – you control a horrible (yet beautiful?) goose whose role in life is to go around pestering the residents of an idyllic village. You solve puzzles through pecking, stealing things in your wicked beak, honking and such. Previously you were limited, confined if you will, to the body of only one such goose. No more. A free update to the game will be released on 23 September, granting you the second goose, so you can play with a friend. The makers are promising you can now “enjoy the entire game as two horrible geese, with a new horrible honk, teaming up to plan some horrible pranks, and generally being horrible to everyone together”. A new horrible honk?A new horrible honk! This is truly the good news that 2020 needed. But I still have lots of questions. Why is it about a goose? Why does the game not have a title? Why is it so popular?There’s something universally appealing about the simplicity of the goose. They are so awful, but so funny. Its success owes a lot to its meme-ability, which is something that the title leans into. Its first trailer, in 2017, went viral just thanks to the aforementioned goose concept, and once it made it to PCs and the Nintendo Switch in 2019, it took off around the world. It’s just a goose: a celebration of a silly idea, but incredibly well-designed and with a beautiful art style. As the makers of Untitled Goose Game said back when it was but a twinkle in their eye, “let’s make a game about this [image of a goose]”. Instead of Untitled Goose Game, it feels to me that it should now be called Geese Game.Yes, it should be called Geese Game. "
"Trevor Noah returned to the Daily Show after a month-long vacation on the eve of Joe Biden’s inauguration, as the country prepared to say farewell to Donald Trump’s presidency. Trump spent his last days in power “like many tinpot dictators”, Noah said, “convincing his most rabid fans to keep fighting for a lost cause while he hides in a bunker somewhere”. Hate Trump or no, “you have to admit a few things about this guy”, Noah added. Namely, that he’s “completely dropped the bar for presidential behavior. I mean, in 10 years, a president could just pee in the middle of a press conference, and everyone will just be like, ‘huh, I guess he just had to go.’’” But Trump has been consistent, Noah added. “The victimhood and racial resentment that came down that escalator in 2015 – those are the same that ended up at the Capitol on January 6th,” he said, a consistency which has “exposed how bullshit so many other people are”. For example, “the way Fox News defended police during the George Floyd protests, you would’ve thought that opposing police brutality was the same thing as killing police,” Noah said. But when Trump supporters, the target demographic of Fox News, stormed the Capitol in an attack that left two police officers dead, Fox News commentators blamed the violence not on the rioters but, in a contortion of logic, “the anti-American left”. “You guys clearly don’t care about cops,” Noah said. “You only care about the idea of using cops to keep black people in their place. So, please, miss me with that bullshit.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert marked the transition of power by revisiting his first Trump-era monologue – “We’ve got four very interesting years in front of us,” he said on 9 November 2016. “I might have undersold that just a smidge,” Colbert reflected on the eve of Biden’s inauguration. “It has been interesting in the same way that riding in a car going over a cliff is thought-provoking.” Colbert recapped the highlights of Trump’s “lowlights”, everything from the Muslim travel ban early in his presidency to inciting a riot at the Capitol and “ruining the YMCA”, one of his favorite campaign songs. “In the end, the takeaway from this presidency is: take him away,” Colbert concluded. The host saved his praise for the American people – “for all of his dangerous assaults on American democracy, in the end, democracy kicked his ass all the way back to Florida,” said Colbert. “And in this case I for one will never, ever be sick of winning. So you should be proud of yourselves – count among your accomplishments this year stopping homegrown American fascism, and hitting 10,000 steps walking between your fridge and your couch.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers revisited the long trail of harm throughout the Trump presidency, up to and including his list of 100 pardons during his final day in office. “Of course this is how the Trump era ends,” Meyers said, “with the faux populist president mulling pardons for wealthy, well-connected allies,” such as his former adviser Steve Bannon. Meyers also had some final parting words for Fox News and congressional Republicans who supported the president throughout his term in office: “The toxic rightwing media apparatus and most of the institutional Republican party spent the last four years colluding with a monstrous and irredeemable man, who has been thoroughly repudiated by the American electorate over and over again,” he said. Trump lost the popular vote in 2016, the House in 2018, got impeached in 2019, lost by 7m votes in 2020, watched the Senate slip from Republican control thanks to the Georgia runoff elections, and got impeached again. “You know what, I take it back – maybe he is a worker,” Meyers concluded, “because you have to work pretty hard to be this unpopular.” Wednesday marks “the end of an error”, said Jimmy Kimmel on inauguration eve. “It feels like the night before my wedding and my divorce all rolled into one,” in which the president offered merely a “poorly constructed, boastful, heavily edited speech” made available on YouTube. “I love this fairytale that he works hard,” Kimmel added, “even though he’s done literally nothing other than try to overturn the election over the last two months. “Looking back, I wonder if this was all worth it to him,” he mused. “I mean, six years ago, we were all perfectly fine to let him keep bumbling around New York pretending to be a billionaire. He could’ve been hosting golf tournaments, making TGI Friday commercials, playing this role he created of the wealthy tycoon. He could’ve bought a couple of new helicopters, couple of new wives, and we would’ve all just rolled our eyes and been like, ‘oh, that’s just Donald Trump.’ “That’s where Donald Trump belonged,” he concluded. “But now most of the country despises him.”"
"The New South Wales consumer regulator is investigating complaints about the illegal resale of tickets to live performance events. NSW Fair Trading announced on Wednesday it was investigating Viagogo after a spike in consumer complaints, but the notorious ticket reseller appeared to be breaching state rules 24 hours later – selling seats for the musical Hamilton in Sydney with a 70% mark-up on Thursday. The Viagogo website was also selling tickets to next year’s Kings of Leon concerts in Sydney for $215 – compared to $150 from the authorised ticket seller; and to Kiwi singer Lorde’s Australian tour next March for $354 – a 400% mark-up on the same tickets being sold by the tour’s organiser, Frontier. The NSW Fair Trading commissioner, Rose Webb, said since live performance events reopened in 2021, the complaints against Viagogo have started to pile up. “Now that [live] events are back on the agenda, we have seen a spike again despite Viagogo being explicitly warned,” she said. “Those within the entertainment and arts industry have been vocal about the obliteration of their industry due to Covid and they do not need the additional stress of ticket resellers scalping well-meaning fans. “We will be investigating and using our powers to stop any unlawful behaviour.” There have been 36 complaints received about Viagogo in 2021 so far, 16 relating to ticket scalping, 11 relating to the cancellation of events that were not refunded, five relating to misleading customers that they are the authorised seller, three for tickets not being delivered in a timely manner and one for not providing age restriction advice, a NSW Fair Trading statement says. Last year Viagogo was fined $7m by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for illegal ticketing practices, ranging from reselling tickets with more than the permitted 10% mark-up on the original price, to selling fake tickets to consumers. A Viagogo spokesperson said: “Viagogo has taken prompt action to remove tickets from our platform that do not comply with the state’s regulatory regime. “Viagogo is committed to complying with legislation in all markets we operate in, including NSW, and when we are notified of listings that are not compliant, we act quickly to remove them. “We look forward to continuing to productively engage with regulators to ensure that our website is compliant and the safe and transparent marketplace we offer continues to help customers gain access to events worldwide.”"

"The first ‘real’ Tyrannosaurus rex to be exhibited in England for more than a century will go on show in Nottingham on Sunday. The skeleton of Titus, discovered in the US state of Montana in 2018, will make its world debut at the Wollaton Hall Natural History Museum as part of a new exhibition on the dinosaur’s life and environment. Titus: T rex is King will enable visitors to follow the fossil’s journey from its discovery in the Montana Badlands, through its excavation, curation, examination, rebuilding and final revelation. “Coming face to face with an actual T rex is an experience very few in the world can claim,” said Rachael Evans, the museums development manager at Nottingham City Museums. “Even in skeleton form, Titus’ power and presence is unmistakable. We have had to dedicate the largest room at Wollaton Hall just to him alone.” The four-metre (13ft) tall and 11-metre long skeleton has not been on display to the public before. The fossil was around 20% complete once fully conserved, so although it is a ‘real’ skeleton, many of the bones are reconstructions made of black obsidian. A complete T rex skeleton has never been found, and most dinosaur skeletons on display in exhibitions are casts of the real bones. The exhibition, which received funding from Arts Council England, aims to dispel some myths about the dinosaur, which roamed the earth more than 66m years ago. Dr David Hone, a palaeontologist and senior lecturer in zoology at Queen Mary University of London, was part of the team tasked with bringing Titus to life. “Titus is an incredibly well-preserved specimen with important and unique pathologies that advance the science of palaeontology and our understanding of these iconic dinosaurs,” he said. Visitors would be able to take a close look at the specimen’s features “and try to decide if in fact he was covered in scales or feathers or both”, he said. A study published in April estimated that 2.5 billion T rex walked the Earth over 127,000 generations for between 1.2m and 3.6m years. About 100 or so T rex fossils have been found. Wollaton Hall has an international reputation for rare dinosaur exhibits, and in 2017 ran a Dinosaurs of China exhibition with a selection of fossils that had never been seen outside Asia before. Titus: T rex is King runs at the Wollaton Hall Natural History Museum until August 2022"
"The original intent behind the @OzKitsch Twitter account was to have a laugh at cringey aspects of Australian life, like concrete koala letterboxes and Ned Kelly bottle openers. There’s certainly no shortage of material. But its purpose has evolved over time. Instead of simply wincing at the olden days or wallowing in nostalgia, it seeks to examine aspects of everyday life that we have seem to have forgotten, either by accident or design: everything from regional beauty contests, monuments that were never built, and high school war cries, to Menzies’ fleeting admiration for Hitler, quack cures for the Spanish flu, and the musical stylings of Alan Jones. It also looks at the way the world sees us and asks penetrating questions like: when did they stop playing the national anthem at the movies? How badly did “Smellbourne” pong in the 1880s? Where do the Blakeney twins sit in the pantheon of Australian popular music? And is Canberra really necessary? (Answer: no). In its slightly cock-eyed way, it draws on the past to illuminate the present. Not so much celebrating our island story as regurgitating it with flecks of carrot and spittle. Every January, OzKitsch curates The Coldest 100 musical countdown, a tin-eared antidote to the Triple J’s Hottest 100. Musical talent is not a prerequisite and yet its popularity grows with each passing year. At one point this year it was the No 1 trending topic on Twitter. Have people no taste? Evidently. Here’s a recent chart topper. There used to be an ad campaign exhorting Australians to strive for excellence, warning them that “near enough is not good enough”. Patently the brickies of Melbourne didn’t get the memo. There’s a thesis to be written about forgotten tourist attractions and why they fell out of favour. Crayfish Park on the Gold Coast was the crustacean equivalent of Bullen’s African Lion Safari except that you could eat the exhibits. Remember the conspiracy theory that claimed Victoria’s CMO Brett Sutton was not a real doctor? Comedy writer James Colley got there first. Except his observation was and remains true. The farm labour shortage is hitting hard. The ABC’s Weekend Magazine has the solution: employ more monkeys. The patron saint of OzKitsch. Once upon a time every city, town and sector of the economy had its own beauty contest.

"“The Trump era revealed a lot about our politics, but one main thing is that many prominent Republicans are just super weird,” said Seth Meyers on Monday evening. The Late Night host pointed to a recent example: Donald Trump Jr, eldest son of the former president, trying to tell “some incomprehensible jokes” at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held in Dallas over the weekend. Trump Jr’s jokes about Texas no longer “leading the charge” failed to draw a single laugh. “ … Right?” he added, to silence. “Last time somebody bombed that badly he became the Joker,” Meyers said. “Don Jr looked like he just walked into a scene in a student improv show and blanked.” Elsewhere at CPAC, numerous Republican figures continued to sow doubt over the Covid vaccine, even as case rates rise among the unvaccinated; according to CBS News, 99.7% of new Covid cases in the US are among unvaccinated people. “I can’t believe it’s even necessary to say that, but here we are,” said Meyers. “It’s like saying, ‘All the red people at the beach are the ones who didn’t wear sunscreen’ – we know what the sunscreen’s for.” GOP figures such as Trump Jr, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ted Cruz have sowed fear over the Biden administration’s door-to-door community outreach plan to encourage vaccinations “purely as a political tactic to scare voters”, said Meyers. Meyers played a clip of Madison Cawthorn, who once called visiting Hitler’s vacation retreat in Germany a “bucket list” trip that “did not disappoint”, in which the North Carolina congressman typified the GOP’s slippery slope argument over door-to-door vaccine outreach. “They could then go door to door to take your guns,” Cawthorn said. “They could then go door to door to take your Bibles.” “You think the government has to build a whole new mechanism to go door to door to raise awareness about vaccines, which they could then use to take away your bibles and your guns? Have you never heard of the Postal Service?” Meyers retorted. “The Republican party and rightwing media have wrought a movement that celebrates low vaccination rates and spins insane conspiracy theories about attempts to get more people to take a life-saving vaccine,” he concluded. “If Republicans had any shame at all, they’d look inward and ask themselves how they got here, but they won’t.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed Covid case increases in 42 states, almost entirely among unvaccinated people. “No, no America, the pandemic’s gotta be over – I threw out my sweatpants,” he said. “I killed my sourdough starter, I drank all my hand sanitizer, I’m not going back to the damn storage room.” “C’mon, guys, get the shot,” he added. “Don’t make celebrities sing again. Haven’t we suffered enough?” Nevertheless, GOP figures have continued to discourage people from getting the vaccine. Greene, for example, tweeted that “thousands of people are reporting very serious life changing vaccine side effects from taking covid vaccines”. “Yes, serious life-changing side effects, like staying alive,” Colbert joked. Colbert also discussed Trump’s latest attempt to spin the events of 6 January into something positive; over the weekend, the former president called into Fox News and called the insurrection “full of peaceful people who are great people … the love in the air, I’ve never seen anything like it”. “Yes, it was all peace and love,” Colbert mocked, “just like Woodstock, when Jimi Hendrix played the Star-Spangled Banner on Nancy Pelosi’s podium.” And in other news, Colbert discussed billionaire Richard Branson’s successful space flight aboard the Virgin Galactic passenger rocket plane, a harbinger of future commercial space travel. Branson technically reached the edge of space, and the crew experienced only four minutes of weightlessness. “He barely went in, and lasted only a few minutes? Well, that is a virgin,” Colbert joked."
"The French choreographer Boris Charmatz opened this year’s Manchester international festival with Sea Change, a live event performed along the cobbled stretch of Deansgate, on a muted grey Thursday evening. Despite a small crowd and a certain lack of atmosphere, it proved to be a delicate, moving enterprise: a line of professional and amateur dancers, each performing their own different “bit”, united by theme. Some clutched their heads, lamented and ululated; others flowed from pose to pose as if doing tai chi in the park; others went through warm-up exercises like joggers, or slipped about as if mired in the mud at Glastonbury; some yelled “Save our rainforests, save our oceans!”, raggedly cheered on an imaginary sports team, or reached for the sky in euphoric, ravey bliss. All had one thing in common: from a fun run to a funeral, a protest march, a boozy barbecue or the advance of the zombie hordes, they referenced collective events. Charmatz gave us back our lost moments of togetherness. There was even a section about running to catch a plane; you know things are bad when being late for something takes on a nostalgic quality. The dancers’ costumes of sweaty white T-shirts, jeans and trainers, smeared with brightly coloured school chalk, emphasised the benign, refreshingly casual tone. With its single line of performers and simple idea, Sea Change was not the 10-minute-long pageant-promenade it had been billed as: it had more in common with amateur street theatre and the Edinburgh festival fringe – but this was all to the good. Its ad hoc, contingent air and humour gave it a lighthearted fellow-feeling that has been sorely lacking. Charmatz reminds us that we humans are communal creatures, we’re meant to be around each other, and something doesn’t need to take place in a temple – or a theatre – to have a ritual function and a bonding warmth. MIF has also commissioned some dance films this year. Breathless Puppets is a 17-minute animation co-created by choreographer Akram Khan and animator, writer and director Naaman Azhari. It utilises rotoscope technology, in which live action is sketched over to give a constantly moving, line-drawn aesthetic. Breathless Puppets tells the story of a young man called Nicholas who wants to be a dancer, despite his family urging him to go into medicine. Nicholas’s loneliness and ambition are contrasted with scenes in which Khan himself performs to a full house of cheering fans. The delicate monochrome rotoscoping works nicely: white lines on solid black for Khan’s storyline and thin, dark lines on white and grey for Nicholas’s suburban yearning, with tree branches and fences carefully picked out. The style also works well to showcase the twisting, loping sinuousness of Khan’s choreography: in a tactile, two-man duet he enacts all the support, reliability and nurturance that Nicholas has lacked from his own father. The plot also takes in forbidden romance, illness and death, but these are unnecessary lunges towards melodrama. Overall, this short film is a stylish reminder of Khan’s gifts and the lure of dance for young wannabes. Star ratings (out of five)Sea Change ★★★Breathless Puppets ★★"
"I grew up with the skiffle artists of the 50s such as the Vipers and Lonnie Donegan. You could play most of the songs if you had a guitar, so we formed a band: Johnny and the Bandit. That sort of music was banned at my school, so we had to practise in the changing rooms. The acoustics were good because it was quite echoey. We had a couple of guitars, a banjo and even a washboard. I was the singer. We thought we were the business. Plus, we were doing something illegal, which made it even more exciting. Our music master still encouraged us because he saw these kids – who hadn’t shown much interest in classical music – suddenly playing musical instruments. Eventually, things loosened up and we got to play at a parents’ concert. We did House of the Rising Sun by the Animals, about the red light district of New Orleans, and we were banned again. How we suffered for our art. There were two cinemas in Epsom, the Odeon and the Granada, so we always got the big films. I loved Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront. I couldn’t take my eyes off him; I thought he was absolutely riveting. I loved Jimmy Stewart in It’s a Wonderful Life; the everyman, struggling alone against impossible odds. I was fascinated by the movies. I thought it would be the most amazing thing to be up on that screen, telling these stories. When I was very young, my parents would leave me at Saturday morning shows to see comics like Charlie Chaplin, but I didn’t find them very funny. I loved The Goon Show on the BBC Home Service. When I was 11 or 12, I saw this French comedy, Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot with Jacques Tati. I thought he was hilarious. He was a comedy genius who left a trail of destruction wherever he went. I owe a lot of my comedy to him. I was fascinated by accents. I had a facility for impersonating people and was always trying to show off. I wasn’t an A-level student; I wanted to get out on the road as soon as possible. But everybody put me off, saying – quite rightly – that acting its very insecure with lots of rejection. So I became articled to an estate agents, a nice steady job where you studied while gaining practical experience. Sitting in an office in the middle of Surrey for six months bored me to tears, and eventually I got sacked. I answered an advertisement in the Stage and ran away with the Argyle Theatre for Youth. Five of us crammed into this little blue van with lights, costumes and a pop-up theatre. We toured the country doing Pinocchio and The Nightingale at two schools a day. I didn’t live anywhere for years because we were always out on the road, but it suited me. I loved being able to muck about doing silly characters and get paid for it. The other thing I was quite good at school was sport. I had good hand-eye coordination and was in all the school teams. I was a big Arsenal supporter from the age of five and I loved cricket. My hero was Tom Graveney. He had a big peak on his cap and stood casually cross-legged at the crease. He just had a wonderful style and artistic flow to his batting. I was born in Bristol, so we shared a West Country connection. A relation of my grandfather took to me to see him play for Gloucestershire, where he scored a lot of runs. I just latched on to him, like he was my man. I was taken to meet him afterwards and was completely speechless. I used to sit and watch him on the telly, but I was so full of that childish desperation for him to succeed that I couldn’t bear watching these horrid bowlers – my enemies – trying to get him out. At school, I tried to emulate him, something I succeeded more in style than I did by scoring runs. I could be out for nought – but quite attractively. The Rolling Stones were the house band from 1963-64 at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, south-west London. I went with a chum of mine. It was packed and boiling hot. These oiks came out and did American blues covers such as Chuck Berry. It was just electrifying. The next year, I was doing repertory theatre in Kidderminster and saw them again. People were throwing themselves from the balcony. They were just amazing. Many years later, I took the wife to see Bill Wyman’s Rhythm Kings. Someone clocked me and said: “Mr Wyman would like to meet you backstage.” Apparently he was a big fan of Only Fools and Horses, but I was completely starstruck. Ronnie Wood wanted to meet me. The Stones played at a big football ground in the US in the 90s. I went into the hospitality area. Charlie Watts walked in and went: “What are you doing here?” I’ve never met Richards or Jagger, but at least I’ve met the rhythm section. I wanted to be a lead guitarist – I’m still waiting for the Stones to call. I would love to have made a century at Lord’s. I could have been a decent soccer player, but I was too lazy. Acting just seemed within me. I joined the repertory theatre and wrote a couple of comedy sketches for the revues. Writing is hard work, even though I’ve managed two autobiographies and two novels. At the Royal Shakespeare Company in the 60s, I met this fellow actor called Andrew Jack. He had a similar lunatic sense of humour and we recorded the worst record of all time, The Ten Days of Christmas by Rentaflop – that was just full of ridiculous noises: “a quack quack in a pear tree”. Kenny Everett played us on Radio 1 and described us as “a real granny frightener”, and we got to be on telly even though we were dreadful. I’ve been very lucky with my acting. I’ve just been doing this DVD – Boycie in Belgrade – about why Only Fools and Horses is so popular in that part of the world. Belgrade has been attacked from left and right, but the people are still very entrepreneurial. Everyone’s trying to make a living, so they identify with Del Boy especially. He never gives up and I think that’s very inspiring, especially after everything the people of Serbia and the rest of what used to be Yugoslavia have been through."
"Helen, I am seeing that awful close-up picture of mouths kissing on my timeline again and hesitate to ask, but why? The short story Cat Person is in the news once more, because a woman named Alexis Nowicki has written an essay for Slate in which she explains that she is the real-life cat person the Cat Person story is based on, and that her ex-boyfriend is the other cat person in the story, and that he was actually a lovely person in real life and really did have cats and wasn’t pretending, unlike in the story. Eh? Back in December 2017, a short story in the New Yorker called Cat Person went absolutely nuts online, becoming maybe the first piece of short fiction ever to do so. In it, the previously unknown writer, Kristen Roupenian, tells the story of a young woman’s relationship with an older man. They exchange jokes about cats. She goes to his house and he says: “Just so you know, I have cats.” They have sex. Later, she suspects he might not really have cats at all. Eventually she ghosts him and he sends her a text that says “Whore”. And IRL? In the Slate story, Nowicki says that when the piece came out, she was watching Call Me By Your Name “for the second time, alone”. She leaves the theatre and sees that her phone is blowing up. A short story has come out in the New Yorker and her friends are texting to ask whether she wrote it under a pseudonym, or whether it is about her, or whether the man – who Nowicki calls “Charles” in the essay – wrote it himself. Was she also grossed out by the picture? She was. In those exact words. And there are a lot of details in the story that match her real life at the time she dated Charles. The protagonist is from the same small town, goes to the same college, works at the same art house theatre. The man in the story is, like Charles in real life, a man in his 30s who is “tall, slightly overweight, with a tattoo on his shoulder” and wears a “rabbit fur hat and a vintage coat”. The decor and contents of his house are the same. But in Nowicki’s experience, the sex was different, and he didn’t send her mean texts. In fact, she emphasises “how respectful and caring he could be” before he died suddenly in November last year. There is more, but you might want to read the essay for yourself (it is sad and thoughtful). But was it definitely her? And how?! Eventually Nowicki contacted Roupenian to find out. Roupenian told her that after having “an encounter” with the real-life Charles, she noticed he had once dated a much younger woman – Nowicki – and mined Nowicki’s social media for the details she used in the story. “I later learned, from social media, that this man previously had a much younger girlfriend,” Roupenian writes in an email. “I also learned a handful of facts about her.” Anything else I should know before I delete every social media account I own? Two things. First, people are debating the ethics of authors using the details of strangers’ lives in their fiction. Second, they are asking a question literary scholars have been discussing for centuries. Which is? Are all cats female and all dogs male?"

"I’m Bridget Christie, a comedian, but I don’t just see comedy. Last weekend I went to a spellbinding exhibition of British folk art called Ritual Britain, set perfectly in London’s atmospheric Crypt Gallery in the bowels of St Pancras New Church in London. Exploring and celebrating Britain’s calendar customs, it’s a collaboration between the artist Ben Edge and Simon Costin from the Museum of British Folklore. It features 20 striking and evocative oil on canvas paintings from Ben’s Frontline Folklore series, alongside objects from Simon’s collection. These included dolls of Morris dancers, a burnt hessian glove from the Ottery St Mary tar barrel burning festival, a selection of folklore archivist Doc Rowe’s photographs and a tall, attractive, well-dressed man made of straw – who has apparently been lined up as Andrew Neil’s next guest on GB news as soon as the exhibition ends on 4 July. Also included in the exhibition is Edge’s illuminating and thought-provoking film Frontline Folklore, documenting the same 20 customs. Edge’s obsession with folklore began by accident one day five years ago when he was on his way to meet the Ravenmaster at the Tower of London, but spotted a line of druids walking along the road and followed them instead. This chance encounter led to a life-changing journey across Britain, culminating in the film, the paintings and a collaboration with the MoBF. My own fascination with Britain’s rituals and traditions didn’t begin when I saw some druids walking through Tower Hill. It began in childhood, when I saw a massive cheese flying through the air. I’m from Gloucester, and when I was little, my parents took me and my eight brothers and sisters to see the Cooper’s Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, which takes place annually every spring bank holiday, and involves locals chasing a 7lb Double Gloucester cheese down a hill with a 50% gradient. It made a lasting impression on me, and in 2006 I wrote an Edinburgh show about it, which ended with me re-enacting the cheese roll by rolling a mini babybel down a papier mache model of a hill I’d made, and chasing it with two figures attached to wires. I’ve been on three different occasions to the Burryman’s Parade in Queensferry – in which a local man is covered head to foot in thistles and marched through the town drunk for over nine hours – but I didn’t stay to the end because I needed the toilet, and I wasn’t wearing a nappy like he was. I also had Morris dancers at my wedding, and for the past two years I’ve been working on a pilot script for a comedy drama about ancient traditions and folklore in the Forest of Dean. The origins of the cheese roll are unknown. One theory is that it’s a pagan ritual intended to bring luck to the harvest, but no one really knows, and it’s the same story for most of these events. For Edge, it doesn’t matter that so many of the original meanings have been lost. It’s precisely this lack of clear, historical facts that makes these bizarre customs so appealing to him as an artist. The uncertainty creates a space for us to insert ourselves into them. It allows us to embellish and add to them – and it’s in the retelling of these stories that we keep them alive. They’re not relics from another time. They tell us who we used to be, but they also tell us who we are now, and who we want to be. They change and evolve just as we do – and they’re changing all the time. In response to the Black Lives Matter movement, many Morris dancing groups, such as the Hook Eagle Morris men, changed their black face paint to blue. Other groups refused to, claiming they’d be disrupting an ancestral tradition. What’s startling about Edge’s paintings is that they manage to look both ancient and modern at the same time. He’s bringing the past into the present in a really unusual, interesting way. In The Autumn Equinox, we see the ancient cloaks of the druids set against London’s skyline; in The Britannia Coconut Dancers, the men’s 18th-century costumes contrast with 21st-century wind farms; in The Summer Solstice, people take selfies in front of Stonehenge. The world around us might have changed, but humans’ basic need for stories and rituals remains the same. Lockdown took all our rituals away from us, so we made our own: we stood in our front gardens and banged saucepans. We need rituals. Rituals mark the passage of time. Rituals, and the onset of menopause. Ritual Britain made me think about so much – about patriotism and heritage, community and social cohesion, time and tradition, stories and class; about what art is and who it’s for. I was expecting to love this exhibition. I wasn’t expecting to leave it feeling proud to be British – especially as I have an Irish passport, thank God. "
"Had it not been for my brother, Stony, I would have remained a school teacher. He made fun of my job to such an extent that eventually I decided to join his group, Dr Buzzard’s Original Savannah Band, as the bass player. Our first album went gold, and we went to California to record the follow-up but it all imploded: madness, egos, and drugs for some band members. When I told the vocalist, Cory Daye, that I was forming my own band and would be the lead singer, she laughed right in my face. I had a lot to prove. I drove all the way from California to New York, and on that journey, envisaged Kid Creole and the Coconuts, a band that didn’t do drugs or have lunacy in the studio. In the Savannah Band I’d modelled my style on 1930s/40s jazz singer and showman Cab Calloway, and I created Kid Creole as an extreme version of that, a sort of lounge lizard/bon vivant or what an ex-girlfriend called a “lovable rogue”. I’d always wanted to be an actor, and played Kid Creole so well that I began to like him more than August Darnell. Growing up in the Bronx, I’d been surrounded by ethnic diversity, so envisaged the Coconuts as a multiracial, mixed-gender band. Coati Mundi, on vibraphone and vocals, had been in the Savannah Band as Sugarcoated Andy but changed his name to avoid the association. Female bass players were uncommon then, but we hired Carol Colman because she was such a badass player. My then wife, Adriana Kaegi, who was a dancer and backing vocalist, led, recruited and choreographed the Coconuts. She wanted a sophisticated group of girls who looked liked her. I listened to country, jazz and Caribbean music and our music was the same melting pot as the people. We were on ZE Records, but co-founder Michael Zilkha wanted bigger things for us and sent us to audition for Sire/Warner. The vice-president, Seymour Stein, fell asleep during the audition but woke up and said: “Yeah yeah, I’ll sign them.” We broke in clubs and discos, then went from the hipster scene to the mainstream with I’m a Wonderful Thing, Baby. The label hated the title because they thought people would go: “Who does this guy think he is?!” But I refused to change it. I’d married a beautiful woman, had success with the Savannah Band and thought I was the business. I got away with it because of the clothes – zoot suits, baggy trousers and a fedora – and a knowingly raised eyebrow. I knew the song would become my calling card – even today at my ripe, old age, people come up to me and go: “I’m a wonderful thing, baby.” I’d just come out of music school with a degree in classical music and had studied jazz composition with the drummer and composer Max Roach. A friend who ran a vintage clothes shop introduced me to August. I was so eager to get into the music business that none of the things I’d heard about him being crazy and a Studio 54 in-crowder put me off. The end of disco and the beginning of the new wave in the early 80s was a very exciting time in New York – fashion, supermodels. We rehearsed solidly but it was always fun. The drummer, Winston Grennan, had been in Bob Marley and the Wailers. I’d studied Beethoven but was surrounded by all these funkmeisters, and was thinking: “What am I doing here?” I’d never written pop music but gave August a tape containing a groove with some instrumental melodies that were the start of I’m a Wonderful Thing, Baby. I hadn’t done any orchestration, so we were busy humming melodies for Charlie Lagond, who played sax and clarinet. I had a vocal melody but the only lyric was “It’s a wonderful thing, baby.” My idea was that love was a wonderful thing, but August [who wrote the rest of the lyrics], being as egotistical as he was, insisted on changing “It’s” to “I’m” and, obviously, he was right. August had come from a humble upbringing and wanted to create this larger-than-life persona who was different to who he was. We were strict about rehearsing but it was a wild time. On tour, we never knew what would happen next. One night there was this enormous explosion, and everyone on stage thought it was a bomb. I said to the tour manager: “I’m only the piano player, but you might have told us you were going to use pyrotechnics.”"
"A question is posed in the group show Poet Slash Artist: what is poetry and what is art, and what happens when they come together? Its answers run the length and breadth of the city, in the form of outdoor artwork by such diverse poet-artists as Tracey Emin, Precious Okoyomon, Lubaina Himid, Sky Hopinka and Isaiah Hull. In addition, Cerys Matthews curates a day of spoken word and music at open-air stage Homeground (2 July), and there’s a film season at HOME. And for a fully immersive, poetic experience to light up the senses, Deborah Warner presents her starry Arcadia installation at the Factory, celebrating poetry and the natural world. Rising art world star Precious Okoyomon is among a diverse group of boundary-traversing artists in a celebration of art and poetry’s intersection They may be based in Brooklyn, New York, but Nigerian-American artist Precious Okoyomon is known and celebrated internationally. Their work defies genre – it has included a home for giant African snails and an ongoing queer cooking collective – and explores the idea of portals and transformation. One unchanging constant in their work is poetry. Before they scooped this year’s prestigious Frieze artist award in New York, they told Frieze: “I started making art because I wanted to give my poetry form”. As an eight-year-old child, Okoyomon even stopped speaking for a year, communicating via poems buried in the ground or stuffed into trees. Okoyomon is one of a new generation of poets connecting with visual art and vice versa. And they are one of 25 artists invited to be part of the group show Poet Slash Artist, put together by the poet Lemn Sissay and art curator Hans Ulrich Obrist. “There is a long and vivid history of exchange between artists and poets, from cubism to Dada to surrealism,” the co-curators explain, and over the past year they have united an incredible group of “luminous” figures who bring art and poetry together. Between them, these artist-poets forge new links across cultures, continents, languages and generations, from Syria to Ireland, and range from newcomers such as Jay Bernard, to household name Tracey Emin, as well as veteran political organiser for the American Indian Movement Jimmie Durham to upcoming Manchester MC Isaiah Hull. Alongside the gallery exhibition, each person has created a brand new work which will be installed in public spaces across the city. As the 96-year old painter and poet Etel Adnan, a Syrian-American born in Lebanon, says, “The world needs togetherness, not separation.”HOME 2-18 July, free, ticket required Theatre director Deborah Warner creates a soothing and profound ode to nature Given a sliver of time and space in which to recover, wildlife will thrive – hence the ubiquitous “nature is healing” meme. But the same is true for humans who are able to make contact with the natural world; nature is healing to us. And it’s our profound connection to it that’s at the heart of Deborah Warner’s new installation for MIF: Arcadia. This immersive experience is the inaugural event at The Factory – the huge, multipurpose arts space space currently under construction that will become MIF’s permanent home. Luminous tents will emit the sounds of poems inspired by nature by such poets as Sappho, WB Yeats and Jackie Kay, read by a cast that includes Brian Cox, Jane Horrocks and Jonathan Pryce. In the centre of Manchester, an Arcadia indeed.The Factory, 10-11 July, £8, young MIF £5"
"From local to global, this year’s festival shines a spotlight on Manchester’s diverse communities, with two projects that start in the city but have international reach. In the words of festival director John McGrath: “The ways in which artists have used the opportunity of the festival to reflect on life as we emerge from lockdown has been inspiring. Our programme is very different to the one we had almost fully planned at the start of last year, but I hope it feels urgent and right.” A bold new work offering a vision of Black achievement in the UK – a journey that starts in Manchester I aim for this to be the largest portrait series of Black British people ever taken before,” says campaigner and photographer Cephas Williams, announcing his new, landmark project, Portrait of Black Britain. Commissioned by Manchester international festival, the first set of images feature the faces of Manchester residents who responded to Williams’s invitation to take part. “This interest in making Black people visible is not just to see their face, but for us also to hear their voice,” he says. “A lot of our contributions, a lot of achievements, and actually our very existence can sometimes go unnoticed”. Driving all Williams’s ambitious, large-scale projects is a sense of real urgency. In 2018, Williams unveiled 56 Black Men: billboard-sized portraits of accomplished Black men, all wearing black hoodies. In the words of David Lammy MP, one of Williams’s subjects, it seeks “to liberate Black men from invisibility”. The murder of George Floyd in 2020 galvanised Williams further – he heard the news when he was expecting the birth of his son, shattering his hopes that his baby might be born into a world in which a Black man could walk down the street without fear. Subsequently, he published Letter to Zion for his son, outlining his vision for global dialogue, representation and equality. The same year, he developed the Black British Network, a platform for tangible change, which has drawn support from such industry giants as Sony, Clear Channel and Sainsbury’s. A community project with vast scope, Portrait of Black Britain makes a difference to everybody. “This is me taking control of my narrative,” says Williams, “and asking other Black people to join me in the re-introduction of our presence and stories in the 21st century.”Manchester Arndale, 1-18 July, free, no ticket required A poignant collection of love letters, sited at Manchester’s restored Central Library Many of us will have been made acutely aware of what we love, what we’ve lost, and what we miss over the course of this past 18 months – such that the idea of writing a love letter might seem a good one. A necessary one, even. Kemang Wa Lehulere’s tender new work, then, arrives with perfect timing: I Love You Too is a book that brings together hundreds of love letters created by Greater Manchester residents in collaboration with local writers, with an exhibition of new work by Wa Lehulere. The objects of their affection run the gamut from local haunts to beloved people; there are paens to Glastonbury, the Eiffel Tower, sneakers, manhole covers, live music, netball and the sea. And these poetic pieces shine with sincerity. “Born of Wythenshawe,” opens a piece by Roy, 67, “made in the factories, a place where workers like me were raised by the best jest and zest of a Manchester community.” Elsewhere, Holly, 23, celebrates Oldham: “A young woman, in her Kardashian-esque lounge wear and pink fluffy sliders, off to the newsagents for her fags – looking like a star!”; and Kemoy, 30, still thinks about Miss Evans, his secondary school form tutor – “one of the first to show an 11-year-old Jamaican boy kindness”. Conceived with the intention of creating a global love library, I Love You Too at MIF marks the beginning of a new series – one that’s set to become an international encyclopedia of devotion.Manchester Central Library 2-10 July, free, ticket required"
"Tasmanian writer Amanda Lohrey has collected her first Miles Franklin Literary Award, at the age of 74. Although a nominee on a number of occasions, and the recipient of other notable gongs over the years such as the Patrick White prize and the Victorian premier’s literary award, it has taken a lifetime for Lohrey to snag what is arguably the most prestigious prize for Australian writing, with her seventh novel The Labyrinth. The $60,000 win was announced on Thursday via live stream for the second year in a row, due to Covid-19 restrictions. Miles Franklin judge and Mitchell Librarian of the State Library of NSW, Richard Neville, described The Labyrinth as “an elegiac novel, soaked in sadness”. It tells the story of a woman who moves to a remote rural community to be closer to her son, who is serving time in jail for homicidal negligence. She comes to know her neighbours, but not necessarily like them, when she embarks on building a stone labyrinth, in an attempt to make sense of the loss and isolation in her life. “It is a beautifully written reflection on the conflicts between parents and children, men and women, and the value and purpose of creative work,” Neville said. Speaking to Guardian Australia, Lohrey said while she was drawn to political themes in her earlier works of fiction, as she has matured as a writer she has become more intrigued with the internal journeys people make in their lives. “I’ve called [The Labyrinth] a pastoral, because I wanted to explore the tree change and the sea change [phenomena] which is actually a centuries-old move,” she said. “People have always tried to escape into some kind of primeval landscape of rural virtue, in order to restore some damaged part of themselves.” The fact that Lohrey’s central character of Erica Marsden chooses to build a stone labyrinth – as opposed to a maze – to repair the broken part of herself is significant. “A maze is a puzzle, it’s a test of your intellect, it has a lot of dead ends, you can get lost,” she said. “A labyrinth has one path in and the same path out. It can be a very complex path that loops around and takes you a while to get to the centre – and a while to get back out – but you can’t get lost … you will always find your way out.” Guardian book reviewer Bec Kavanagh describes The Labyrinth as a “sharply tuned novel” and a “sprawling narrative that resists rigid expectations”. “The Labyrinth offers a pull towards the unknown and a comfort in solitude,” Kavanagh wrote in August last year. “Despite sometimes eerie loneliness, the book is quietly compelling, a carefully planned reflection on the many ways that we might retrace and remake ourselves and our relationships.” Lohrey said the novel, published by Text Publishing, had been well received widely, but declined to say whether she believes The Labyrinth is her best work yet. “I have had a tremendous amount of positive feedback, particularly from book groups and book clubs, they can often be very critical,” she said. “But my novels are all very different, and it’s very hard to be objective about your own work. “And of course the reader is the co-creator of the book, they bring 50% to it. And so the book is different for each reader. “It’s fascinating when you go to book clubs as a guest and you hear them argue about your book and you think, ‘was that the book I wrote?’, because people reading fiction, it’s such a deeply subjective experience.” Female writers have dominated the Miles Franklin Literary award for the past decade. Only one male writer, Serbian-born A S Patrić [Black Rock White City], has been awarded the prize in the past 10 years – in 2016. “Funnily enough, since the Stella prize [introduced in 2013 to recognise female writers, and a response to the traditional male dominance in Australian literary prizes], more women have won the Miles Franklin than men,” said Lohrey. “I don’t think anyone now in the current climate would bother setting up any more gender-specific prizes, we’ve got one, and that’s enough,” she said. “But good on the Stella, the more prizes the better. We need all the prizes we can get in Australia, it’s a small market, and even writers that are well reviewed and sell moderately well are still not making a good living. “A dollar prize really sets you up to write your next book.” Like most writers, Lohrey is loth to discuss the book she is now working on, although she is happy to reveal it is already half-finished. “Writers are deeply superstitious creatures, and also what you think the novel is about often times [it] turns out to be about something else,” she said. “It kind of evolves as you go along and that’s that’s the fun of it, you never know where you’re going end. “It’s a very playful exercise, even though there’s a lot of anguish along the way because, like a maze, you can go up a lot of your own dead ends, before you get where you need to go.”"
"On Wednesday’s Late Night, Seth Meyers ridiculed Republican efforts in Texas to pass sweeping restrictions on voting, after Trump won in Texas with the smallest margin for a Republican in 24 years, and Biden got the largest percentage of any Democratic candidate since Jimmy Carter won the state in 1976. “Republicans are terrified of the possibility that Democrats could continue making gains in Texas and potentially win the state’s electoral votes in a future presidential election,” Meyers said. “They’re not hiding it or being shy about it.” Earlier this month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott called a special legislative session to pass a series of voting restriction laws. State Democrats later fled to Washington in an attempt to thwart measures that would criminalize election officials who proactively send mail-in ballots, ban 24-hour voting, ban drive-thru voting, add new ID requirements for mail-in voting and expand the power of partisan poll watchers. “It’s one thing to say, ‘We can’t lose Texas, so we need to work on our message and our policies,’” Meyers said. “It’s another to say, ‘We can’t lose Texas, so we’re changing the rules.’ It’s like Subway deciding between actually using tuna or calling it ‘tuna’ and hoping no one notices.” Texas already has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the US and was among the states with the lowest turnout in 2020. It is one of the few states without online voter registration, and allows only those 65 and older, with a disability or who meet other criteria to vote by mail. The new measure would suppress voter turnout, particularly among black Texans. An earlier draft of the bill even barred voting before 1pm on Sundays, a clear attempt to thwart long-standing “souls to the polls” initiatives by black churches. Though the provision was eventually removed, “still, it’s been clear from day one what this is all about,” Meyers said. “Republicans admitted it. They want to hold on to power in Texas.” “The rules in Texas are already clearly skewed to the types of voters Republicans want to show up to the polls,” he added. For example, under the state’s voter ID law, a handgun permit is an acceptable form of ID but a state-issued university ID is not. “That’s really the whole game,” Meyers said. “The only way it could be more obvious is if they said ‘You can’t use a driver’s license but you can use a Maga online store frequent shopper card.’” Stephen Colbert recapped pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo’s visit to the White House on Wednesday to encourage teens to get the Covid vaccine. “Rodrigo told everyone who’s already been vaxxed, ‘good 4 u, you look happy and healthy,’” Colbert said. “If you didn’t get that reference, I’m guessing you’ve been eligible for a vaccine since December.” “The White House needs all the help it can get promoting the vaccine because Fox News and the GOP do not, uh, what’s the word … care whether you live or die,” he added. Case in point: GOP-controlled Tennessee, whose department of health will halt all adolescent vaccination outreach for not just coronavirus, but all diseases, after pressure from Republican lawmakers. The state has one of the worst vaccination rates in the country, “and they aim to keep it that way,” said Colbert. The Late Show host also discussed a rash of books on the final days of the Trump presidency, some whose titles are Trump quotes, such as “I Alone Can Fix It” and “Frankly, We Did Win This Election.” “Those, of course, join the ranks of other great titles like ‘People Are Flushing Toilets 10 Times, 15 Times,’ ‘The Kidney Has a Very Special Place in the Heart,’ ‘Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV: The Book,’ and of course, ‘In Europe, They Live — They’re Forest Cities, They’re Called Forest Cities. They Maintain Their Forest. They Manage Their Forest. I Was With the Head of a Major Country — It’s a Forest City,’” Colbert quipped. The new material includes details on Trump’s fury with Brett Kavanaugh after the Supreme Court Justice sided with the majority in its decision not to hear any of the former president’s election challenges. Trump felt Kavanaugh owed him a favor for sticking by him during his contentious confirmation hearings, when he was accused of sexual assault. “Where would he be without me?” Trump said in an interview for Michael Wolff’s book Landslide. “I saved his life. He wouldn’t even be in a law firm. Who would have had him? Nobody.” “Well, that’s not true – I’m sure he would’ve been welcome at the law firm of Tobin, PJ & Squee: the boof will set you free!” Colbert joked. “Of course, the former president can’t give a quid without hoping for a little pro quo.”"
"It was Atlanta that made me realise how great Donald Glover is. It was no longer Donald solo as a singer, rapper or comedian. He now had an ensemble to carry the story and communicate his perspective in a way that was elevating. It set the tone for the way I approached the podcast. I heard him speak when he released his book Prisoner to the Streets and I saw the person I would have been if I had been through what he went through. He’s offended by the condition of the streets. He writes for the people in the situation he came from – people who need more books they can relate to. I’ve known Jorja since she was 17 and she was already a prodigy. She’s an old soul – a very wise woman. I can listen to her songs and come up with scenes and backstories. She’s got a song with Maverick Sabre called Slow Down. In four minutes it feels like a movie. She released a series on YouTube called Gemma K’s Perfectly Perfect Love Life. It’s delivered in a DIY style that’s typical of this generation of online content creators. Part of the joke is that it looks like your friend has just jumped off the sofa and told a story to make you laugh. I was 13 years old when I read White Teeth. I appreciated her depiction of the multiculturalism of our area and that’s been a theme that has continued throughout her writing. She’s a genius. Reading her work from a young age has shaped my expectation of how far our little local story can go. There are fundamental assumptions about economics that most of us don’t feel qualified to challenge, but Mariana tells a powerful story. I met her two years ago and she’s become the supervisor of my PhD, which is about redefining the flow of value from the creative Black community. Insecure is a very clever, very funny show. Issa Rae makes sharp observations about relationships and the quest to find your rhythm in your 20s and 30s. Where do you fit? She talks about being a Black person trying to do right by the Black community, but constantly coming up against so much insecurity. When you see Anne Kansiime live you get a sharp insight into Ugandan society. She talks about dysfunctional institutions and the frustrations of day-to-day life. It’s just that she jokes her way through it. Without knowing the context, you can still enjoy the laughs. She’s an absolute inspiration. In I May Destroy You I saw a maturity of subject matter and a complex character. There’s friendships she’s neglecting, people she’s taking for granted, a deadline that she keeps missing, questionable decisions that she’s making. That’s advanced writing. Kendrick is sorely missed right now. For our generation he’s been an antidote to what is accepted as the safe choice for the rap template. He’s helped me evolve my understanding of the psychology of rap. He’s been a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of hip-hop, and music in general.

"This was a big thing for me: lots of recording off the radio. I’d wait for the chart show, and I’d know that Madonna’s Into the Groove was currently at No 3. I remember that pressured feeling of trying to hit record at the right time so you don’t get too much of the DJ introducing the track, and I’d build up these compilations. I did my own best-ofs – the Cure: 79-82 – or call them things like Dark Trip. I’d draw stuff and then go down to my dad’s office to use the photocopier and cut it all out, and print out homemade covers, getting the tracklisting really nice on the back. Making a mixtape for my girlfriend was a way of subliminally sneaking in things about love. When you can’t say what you want to say, but there’s a JJ Cale track or a Beach Boys track that does. You don’t make anything of it, you just pop it in there and it’s like [sings]: “I lurve you!” I also remember getting a microphone for the cassette recorder and being able to do bits between songs, little customised stings. I’d make some noises, or go: “Right! Next!” I suppose they were inspired by Monty Python. I was an 80s kid, definitely a chart kid, Madonna and Phil Collins and all that stuff was massive for me. So my early teens were kind of that transition, when I was ditching chart music and discovering these bands through my older brothers and older mates. Bands like the Darkside – a really cool record, sprawling and psychedelic and discordant and a bit weird – Chapterhouse, Dinosaur Jr, the Cure, the Smiths, Pixies, Inspiral Carpets. I was only 12 when the Stone Roses’ Sally Cinnamon came out, that was a massive track – it didn’t sound like anything else. And I was rooting out records from the 60s and 70s I hadn’t heard yet. I remember feeling a massive kind of awakening, going from Pet Sounds to Spacemen 3 to Inspiral Carpets to some obscure Frank Zappa record. This was a row of four little houses across the way from my parents’ house, five minutes from where I lived [in Wheatley, Oxfordshire]. An eclectic bunch of people lived there: a doctor, a guy who’d just come out of the army, a couple of dealers, a few other stoners we got on well with. The sort of place where, if there’s no one in, you just push the door open, let yourself in and light the fire. Doc would arrive back from his shift, and we’d all be sitting in his living room watching A Clockwork Orange. Mick [Quinn, Supergrass bassist] lived there for a few years, and we were working together at the local restaurant in the kitchens, washing up and mopping floors. We’d do late shifts, finish at one in the morning, go back to the cottages to play guitars for hours and watch movies. It’s kind of where Supergrass was born – any opportunity I’d sneak out of my parents house to go over and have a smoke or listen to some Zappa, or watch the Woodstock movie. We’d listen to comedy records: Cheech and Chong, Monty Python, Derek and Clive. We ended up rehearsing there and did our first four-track demos in the living room, for what ended up being [debut album] I Should Coco. It was a catalyst to open myself to all kinds of different things, and people. I was 15 and these were all working adults – I thought they were all 40 but they were probably 23. My folks weren’t too happy, there was a bit of weed around, but it was cool … one of those creative awakenings. The guy who had come out of the army ended up being our tour manager for a short time. He was quite a big bloke and super confident, and we thought: yeah, you’re the guy to drive us around and fight our battles against promoters who wouldn’t give us any money and thought we were too young. We’d get laughed at when we went into a venue – “Can I help you?” – and we said we were there to play a gig, because we looked about seven. We needed someone to have our backs. School was really dull as a teenager and I grew up in a pretty sleepy village, so life was moving at a snail’s pace for me. I remember that feeling: needing to find some excitement, something faster, a bit of buzz. It was cool discovering things in the cottages and having that freedom. It felt good that life was speeding up. A massive, massive song. I used to have this terrible Alba midi system – the record player used to destroy all the records with this horrible scratchy cheap needle. But I’d play it every night. It was big inspiration for getting into a band. Coming out of the shiny 80s, it was exactly where my head was at during that time – the album this is from, Playing With Fire, had beauty, danger and discordance, and brilliant tracks. It had that mixture of 60s Velvet Underground vibes, but also the contemporary sounds of 1989 and 1990 where guitars got a lot filthier again, more aggressive. Me and Danny [Goffey, Supergrass drummer] used to wander around going “it takes just fiiiiive seconds …” – this brilliant part of that song where it builds up at the end. “To realise that the time … is right!” It really spoke to us, a really powerful record. It was very word of mouth then – I suppose you’d have Melody Maker or NME or something to say “this band are cool”, but other than that it was what your mates were into, being handed a cassette. It felt like our record, much like when I first heard Sally Cinnamon or Fools Gold by the Stone Roses. You just take ownership. That’s what I love about music: that record belongs to you for your own reasons, completely different from someone else’s, and completely different from the songwriter’s. I caught the tail end of rave, and managed to sneak off to one when I was 15. It seemed like if people were really into raves, they were really into Spacemen 3. I find rave and psychedelic rock’n’roll go hand in hand, because, y’know, you’ve got to listen to something on the comedown. In my later teens, when Danny and I first moved in together, these seemed to be places where we’d formulate our plans to be the next Inspiral Carpets or Dinosaur Jr or Spacemen 3. Danny and I would often frequent the charity shops, trying to outdo each other: who could buy the most wild flares, or velvet suit or wizard’s cape? I must have had a few years at around 16 and 17 where I looked like a 70s children’s TV presenter. We’d spend the afternoon in the Gloucester Arms, which had the best jukebox in town: you’d walk in and you knew it would be Brass in Pocket, or Free Bird, or All the Young Dudes. It was kind of a rockers’ pub. I remember working in a shitty cafe-kitchen in town, and then after my shift, heading towards the Gloucester, stinking of a mixture of ice-cream and grease, really pissed off. I’d arrive and they’d all be hammered, having a great time. It wasn’t staying in the pub all day and getting really trashed and bingeing, it was just hanging out somewhere for hours, and we’d talk about ideas and play pinball. Weirdly quite innocent. We’d talk about the next gig – or the first gig. That was really as far ahead as we were looking. We’d had a little taster of it, in a school band, playing in the drama studio. Just loads of cover versions, and then the headteacher came in and broke up the kids because they started moshing. That was the moment where I thought: I like this, this is cool! That gave us a taste. I remember playing the Jericho Tavern at 15 years old, and I think that’s where we signed our first deal, with Nude Records – actually, my parents signed it, because I was too young. We all wrote weird little comedy songs when we were kids, but nothing serious until we got past the school band stage. We were doing a few cover versions – a couple of Cure songs, Freak Scene by Dinosaur Jr – before we dived into writing, so our own stuff was influenced by what we’d been playing. We had a track called You Keep Punching Me which was a punk song with the same chords as Spacemen 3’s Revolution, but loads faster. We were playing this a lot when we first went down to Sawmill Studios in Cornwall to record the very early days of I Should Coco, around 1993. They had a Sega Mega Drive there – we’d do loads of sessions and recording, and at the end of the day we’d just play Speedball for hours. There was something really addictive about this game. It was set like 100 years in the future, and was a cross between American football and ice hockey; you had to build up these insane characters with armour and skills, and create these Mad Max-esque players. I think it was inspired by the James Caan film Rollerball. It was ridiculous, very violent – although the graphics were very 16-bit, so there was no real sense of it. It was a bonkers, fast-paced game. Other people dug Sonic the Hedgehog, but we were crazy about Speedball. As a kid, I saw the 1983 Steven Spielberg and John Landis movie adaptation. The opening story, with Dan Aykroyd, freaked the hell out of me. I was a massive fan of his, always so warm, friendly and funny – and at the end he turns into this monster out of the blue, this jump-scare, shocking moment. It stayed with me for weeks, I had nightmares about it. The other three stories are brilliant: there’s a reworking of Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, the original William Shatner one, with a monster on the wing of the plane. Then in my teens I got into the old Rod Sterling black and white ones from the 50s, and got all the box sets. It was an obsession for a while, and I still go back to them now. There’s one I always remember about this guy, where nuclear war had broken out, he was alive, the last man on Earth, and he was an avid reader – all he wanted to do was read. He found this library … and he tripped and smashed his glasses. “No! I had all the time I needed!” A classic Twilight Zone twist. In the UK, we had Tales of the Unexpected, which is great, but super dry, no particular tension, just odd Roald Dahl Englishness. With The Twilight Zone, the subject matter was out there, a bit more sci-fi and weirder stories – and I always liked the twist, that’s what I connected with. A moment when it all changes, when you realise what it’s been leading up to is not what you thought it was. Being a young teenager, when it’s the awakening of everything, I thought that was really cool. You can take that idea into lots of areas, and we did it in music – weird time changes out of nowhere, or like making those mixtapes, putting a weird bit in between songs.

"George the Poet first met Munya Chawawa when he was invited on the latter’s Reprezent 107.3 FM radio show to talk about his single, Follow the Leader, and recently launched podcast. Some three years on, and the careers of both men are transformed: George has left his label to become a spoken-word artist, activist and PhD student. His Have You Heard George’s Podcast? has also reached Peabody award-winning heights, with a new series introducing his expansive theory about Black music’s untapped socio-economic potential. Meanwhile, Chawawa has become Britain’s foremost social-media satirist, laying into government corruption and grime beefs with equal alacrity, and earning a major label record deal in the guise of posh drill rapper, Unknown P. His latest viral video, the Matt Hancock-inspired Shaggy parody It Was Me, has 2.5m views on Twitter and counting. Both men drop bars, but you couldn’t call them “rappers” – they’ve had to invent new artistic forms (such as George’s podcast-length poems) to keep pace with their own creativity. So, when the two sat down together to map their respective journeys, the intersections and connections – from macho expectations to monetising rhyme – kept popping up. The questions came from both directions, but this time it was George – now a seasoned podcast interviewer – who got to ask his first … George the Poet: The elements that you combine show a deep understanding of the subtext within grime, but I can also tell you’ve got a broad view of British society … you can quickly draw a parallel between some government figure and a play on words that would resonate with the street. How much access did you have to the culture, growing up? Munya Chawawa: Barely any. As a child in Zimbabwe, we didn’t have access to any of that music, really. I missed out on a lot of old-school bangers that everyone would sing at raves. Then I moved to Norwich [aged 12] and, again, there was no real access to that kind of music. I was also bullied at school, not like severe bullying, but just people making efforts to sabotage my academic work. For example, the day I was in hospital having my appendix removed, the boys in the class told the substitute teacher I was selling weed. But the thing is, I was a very good boy! GtP: Do you think that you would have had that hard time if you acted like a rebel? MC: I don’t think there would have been any way to gain acceptance, because the other Black guy in the year, he was misbehaving, but it didn’t do anything to boost his acceptance. So, anyway, in order to stand up to these bullies, I started to train a lot. I’d literally go home and do 1,000 press-ups and 1,000 sit-ups, every single night, right? So I was absolutely shredded, and while doing this I was typing into YouTube, “workout music”. One of the first things I heard was a freestyle by P Money on MistaJam’s show [on BBC Radio 1Xtra] and I would just play it relentlessly. There was a part within his freestyle where he would go through the letters of the alphabet and do, like, a rhyming word for each one. GtP: I remember that one. Genius. MC: That was my first introduction, and then what I would do was – bearing in mind, I’m in this little village, so I had to entertain myself – pick songs and learn the words. When I moved to London, I thought to myself, “you know what? I’m not even gonna pretend I know about all this stuff”. I’m just going to ask people, like, “What’s a clash?”, “Who is Burna Boy?” And then, the way that I turned it into satire, was imagining what would have happened if I’d moved to London and I hadn’t bothered to learn. GtP: My mind is blown! We just have inverse journeys. So I was there, but I wanted to get out, and the age you were when you were discovering grime – 14, 15 – was the age I was when I became an MC. But the over-simplified narrative in the music started to bother me, because I had little brothers. I didn’t appreciate older guys basically putting a battery in their back to be of the streets. And then I got a breather, finally, when I went to uni. That’s when I was able to shake off what you were immersing yourself into, the rapper thing, and I became a poet. But imagine who you would have been without that education! The music just comes and acts like a flying carpet from your window, to some world where you can just become. So before you started doing your online thing, did you ever try writing? MC: Lyrics? Nah … Oh no, that is a complete lie! I would put on these beats by MF Doom and my little sister and I would freestyle for hours. I loved doing it, but I thought to myself, number one: I’ve got the weirdest accent in the world, no one’s going to want to listen to this. Number two: rappers usually talk about their life story; my life story is that I’ve been chased by a fox that ran through the village today. So I was just like a rapper in my room, y’know? But I loved it. I loved rhyming, trying to fit syllables and words, and combine semantics. In my mind it was like a big jigsaw puzzle. GtP: I can hear the love that you have for it, because you take an idea and you organise it exactly as I would. Because it’s all about solutions, isn’t it? How do I get from A to B, while maintaining a rhyme? But you think about it very methodically and it comes across clean. MC: I remember, when I got you on the show [Breakfast With Munya], I wanted it to feel like an intelligent interview. I’m really proud to see someone so intelligent, and who speaks on matters that are Black. The fact that you’ve been to Cambridge and you are a poet, you could easily monetise it, without ever turning back to where you’re from, and the issues that do affect our people. But you’ve not shied away from that, and I have a huge respect for you for doing so. GtP: I felt that you approached that interview with respect, which is why I’ve always remembered you as a talented interviewer … So when you popped up as a fucking satire artist, I was like, “Yo! This guy?!” And watching your satire, I felt like I related to you more. Like, I always was uncomfortable with the fact that most Black storytellers from my environment, most rappers, have an audience because the hook is trauma. That’s what the audience wants from them: they want to hear how dysfunctional their upbringing was, how many drugs they sold, how many summers they spent in prison. And we’ve partly adopted this in the culture as bravado. Now we call it “toxic masculinity” – and maybe it is also that – but looking back, there were kids that were clearly going through abuse, right? So it becomes a natural response to stick your chest out and act like nothing bothers you. MC: I don’t think poetry is perceived as being very masculine. In the same way, satire, acting or any kind of putting yourself out there isn’t viewed as the most macho thing. One of my characters, Unknown P, he’s this archetypal elitist and with that there’s a certain flamboyance that can be perceived as quite camp. Some people are so stunned! They’re like, “What if people think you’re gay?” And it’s like, so what? Get with the times! I’ve happily been able to sort of park my masculinity in order to get into character, or to put across a message. And the fact that people respond so positively suggests to me that there are probably a few guys who’d like to do the same, but just feel they don’t have licence. GtP: And it’s not just toxic masculinity. I also set my sights on other things that need to be rethought. We cannot afford to keep having only a couple of superstars in each generation. You listened to P Money and that set you on a train, and that train was populated with millions of unseen people who made a contribution to the culture that you were able to benefit from. Likewise [for me]. What would be ideal is if the economic consequences of this culture were reinvested into the communities that drive innovation. But the turnaround time [of your sketches]: everyone wants to know how you do it. A thousand push-ups, from year 9! Is that it? MC: I just think I want to do the best version of what I can do, and I understand it takes certain sacrifices. Sometimes I’ll miss special occasions, or if a mate invites me to dinner, I’ll say, “Yes, but I might cancel on you five minutes before if Matt Hancock is snogging his aide behind a door.” I’m happy to make those sacrifices because, right now, I feel like I’ve got great momentum, and I can. That’s the simple reason. At this point in my life, I haven’t got any kids, I’ve got time, so why wouldn’t I? What are some of the sacrifices you’ve had to make for your art? GtP: Well, when you met me, it was as a musician and I had to step away from doing that. I had to. I was intending that my hook would always be: “I have a compelling argument for the future of the community”, but I always knew that I’d have to create demand for that. Otherwise I would have to service existing demand and just try and slip that in there – which the label tried to influence me to do. So, moving away from the label, not being plugged into the machine that allows you to be the No 1 artist, that was definitely a sacrifice. And my family didn’t understand at the time. But there wasn’t a doubtful bone in my body. Even at that point, I was clear that rhyming is a magic potion; it’s a charm – it literally works like a charm. If you can rhyme your thoughts, you’ll find a space to do it. MC: I was going to ask you: your first-ever poem, what was it about? GtP: It was about the Emancipation Proclamation, I was 13 years old. MC: Nice and light, then! Did you even know what poetry was before that? GtP: I had a vague idea, yeah. And the vague idea that I had is pretty much what I still do. We did English GCSE and I found all these different technicalities to how poetry is defined in this country. That was interesting, and I got the grades I needed to, but I just went back to what I was doing at home with my friends, in order to create the poetry career that I now have. How crazy is that? The streets taught me. MC: I think your first poem is a bit more impressive than mine. I think mine was a remix of The Very Hungry Caterpillar. So you’ve outdone me there."
"Late-night hosts recapped the war within the GOP this week over how to handle the Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the extremist follower of the QAnon conspiracy movement who has claimed the Parkland school shooting was staged and endorsed the execution of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. On Thursday, the Democratic House voted to strip Greene of her committee assignments, a day after House Republicans refused to censure her. Facing a decline in her legislative power, Greene addressed Congress and backtracked somewhat on previous claims – she now believes “school shootings are absolutely real”, and that “9/11 absolutely happened”. “All right, well, at least now we know 9/11 happened,” Jimmy Kimmel deadpanned on Thursday night. “Can you imagine having to go in front of the House of Representatives to say 9/11 happened? “Klan mom was in top form” during her congressional “apology”, Kimmel continued. Greene claimed that her QAnon-supporting Facebook posts from 2018 were merely from her past. “This woman was tweeting nutso conspiracy theories as recently as yesterday,” Kimmel countered. “There are so many videos where she’s spreading and giving credibility to QAnon, now she says it’s time to heal,” Kimmel added, playing a clip of Greene equating QAnon and “the media” for spreading lies. “That’s right, the woman who started impeachment proceedings against Joe Biden the day he took office is calling for unity now,” he said. “The congresswoman who wants to execute Nancy Pelosi is right – we need to come together, and the media is just as guilty as QAnon! That’s like saying Jell-O is just as guilty as Bill Cosby. It’s nonsense.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers blasted Greene’s “apology” to Congress, in which she attempted to distance herself from her QAnon social media posts as recently as 2018. “She obviously is not sincere,” Meyers added of her remarks. “She’s been raising money off it, and then today she spoke on the House floor, where instead of apologizing unequivocally and denouncing her previous comments, the best she could do” was assert that 9/11 “absolutely happened”. “Oh, my God, thank you, it is so big of you to admit that. What else would you like to clarify?” Meyers deadpanned, then imitated Greene: “I would also like to make clear that Inception is just a movie, RoboCop is not real, and the giant glowing orb in the sky is, in fact, the moon and not a secret sky bank where Bill Gates keeps all his gold bars.” Greene’s removal from the House budget, education and labor committees is “a pretty sweet deal”, said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. “Basically, her punishment for acting insane was to do less work for the same amount of money. “Honestly, I think kicking her off these committees could actually backfire,” he added. “The last thing you want to do with a crazy person is give them time to be crazy. That’s why they should put her on all the committees – then you’ll never hear from her again.” Noah also dug into the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, for claiming to reporters that he’d never heard of QAnon. “It’s truly amazing that this guy acts like he doesn’t even know what QAnon is even after they tried to kill him – most people would have at least Googled him at that point,” he said. Plus, “it’s not like these guys don’t have the time to research conspiracy theories”, he added, “because when it comes to Hunter Biden, they remember every word like it’s the lyrics to their favorite song – ‘the Burisma emails decrypted from the Delaware laptop have been verified by Tony Boblinsky.’ But ask them about the biggest rightwing cult in the country, and they’re like ‘Uh, Q-non? Qua-who-nah-nah? Man, who can keep track of this stuff?’” As for Greene’s statement to Congress, in which she acknowledged that school shootings such as the Parkland massacre in 2018 had, indeed, happened? “Hey, I’m glad that she’s come around to the standard Republican belief that school shootings are real and that nothing should be done to stop them,” Noah joked. And on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert ripped Greene’s statement to Congress, in which she said “any source of information that is a mix of truth and a mix of lies is dangerous”. “You’re right, it’s dangerous to mix a truth,” Colbert responded, “like you saying ‘I used to believe in QAnon’, and you lying like, ‘Now I don’t any more’.” Greene also made a point to say “9/11 absolutely happened”, to which Colbert offered a harsh rebuke. “You know what? This may come as a surprise to you, but those of us who watched those buildings burn with our bare eyes here in the New York City area are not that impressed with your willingness to admit that it happened,” he said. “This is the modern GOP: they want credit for recognizing reality.”"
"Late-night hosts react to the second day of Donald Trump’s impeachment trial for inciting insurrection, in which House managers played disturbing footage from the 6 January attack on the Capitol. With all the footage from the Capitol siege and social media posts by the rioters, House impeachment managers have “basically a slam-dunk case”, said Trevor Noah on Wednesday’s Daily Show. “This would be like having a murder suspect who left his DNA at the scene, dropped a bloody glove, and fled the scene in a Ford Bronco,” he added, referencing the OJ Simpson case. “There would be no way you couldn’t convict that guy!” On Wednesday, House impeachment managers displayed “harrowing” video of the violent attack on the Capitol and its police. “We all expected the Democrats to present a competent, compelling case,” Noah said of the emotional footage. “But what nobody expected was that Trump’s lawyers would be so terrible.” Trump’s two defense lawyers, Bruce Castor and David Schoen, rambled through several tangents and never offered a cogent defense for the ex-president. “It was going so badly for the Republicans, I thought Ted Cruz was going to start another insurrection just to change the subject,” Noah joked. But “luckily for these lawyers, we all know, and they know, that no matter how bad their defense is, they’re still gonna win this trial”, Noah added, which “makes a mockery of the entire idea of accountability”. The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump was always going to be rough, but “turns out it’s even worse than we thought”, said Stephen Colbert following day two. “And I gotta tell you: I came into this with my ‘it’s pretty bad’ septic tank already brimming over.” The Late Show host replayed a horrifying clip of the Capitol siege in which officer Eugene Goodman directed the Utah senator Mitt Romney, one of the few Republicans openly critical of Trump, away from the oncoming mob. “Keep in mind, those maniacs would’ve loved to have gotten their hands on Mitt Romney, who voted to impeach the former president the last time that he deserved it,” Colbert said. Yet “despite the powerful evidence supplied by the House managers and objective reality, many GOP senators seemed to be barely paying attention”, instead reading books or briefing papers on other topics. “Yes, other more interesting topics,” Colbert deadpanned, “like ‘how does history tend to remember cowardly fascists and enabling worthless pieces of garbage?’” Given the amount of evidence amassed by House impeachment managers, “you think [Trump’s] lawyers would be a little more prepared”, said Seth Meyers on Late Night. “Instead, Castor meandered aimlessly like he was auditioning to be on one of those sleep apps.” Among Castor’s rambling lines: “There isn’t a member in this room who has not used the term ‘I represent the great state of fill-in-the-blank.’ Why? Because they’re all great? Yeah. But you think yours is greater than others because these are your people.” “I left a voicemail on ecstasy in 1997 that made more sense than this,” Meyers zinged. “What are you talking about? The House managers just laid out a devastating case against the president with harrowing video footage and you sound like you’re vamping at the end of social studies class.” Castor’s teammate David Schoen, meanwhile, went with what Meyers called the “heinous asshole” route, with hyperbole such as: “This trial will tear this country apart, perhaps like we have only seen once before in our history.” “I’m sorry, are you threatening a second civil war?” Meyers fumed. “You know that’s basically what Trump got impeached for, right? That’s like if OJ’s lawyers had said, ‘You better acquit him, or I will stab every one of you.’” “I have no idea how you could watch that and vote for anything other than guilty as charged,” said Jimmy Kimmel of the riot footage played by House impeachment managers. “Trump should’ve been removed from office that day.” Nevertheless, conviction appears to be a remote possibility, as Republican senators are loth to anger Trump’s base. The defense’s argument is “basically telling Republican senators ‘Nice jobs you’ve got there, would be a shame if something were to happen to them!’” Kimmel said. Trump, meanwhile, was reported to not be happy with his lawyers’ performance, which left him screaming at his TV. “They say the last time he was this mad was when he found out there was a Donald Trump Jr,” Kimmel joked. And on Full Frontal, Samantha Bee skirted the impeachment trial in a segment on the movement to raise the federal minimum wage to $15. “The pandemic has put a renewed focus on a working class that now has to risk getting sick on the job while receiving little to no support,” she explained. The US minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009 – “it’s insane that America updates its Spidermen more frequently than the minimum wage,” Bee joked. Raising the minimum wage would help 10.5 million families who rely on safety net programs such as Medicaid, Chip or Snap, Bee explained. “Republicans love to bash these programs and claim too many people are using them, but fewer people would need assistance if their employers just paid them a living wage. It’s not fucking rocket science.” Joe Biden’s plan would raise the minimum wage gradually to $15 by 2025. “Think of it as minimum wage foreplay,” said Bee. “It will take awhile to build but when it gets there, it’s fine. “Regardless of what Republicans say, paying Americans fairly doesn’t soften the economy,” she later concluded. “It strengthens it, it makes it bigger – like foreplay!”"
"On Thursday, House impeachment managers wrapped their case against Donald Trump for inciting the insurrection of the Capitol on 6 January, with yet more previously unseen, disturbing footage from the riot. The videos “make it pretty obvious that Trump incited the rioters”, said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. “They were wearing Trump hats, carrying Trump flags, and they all just watched Trump speak and were chanting ‘fight for Trump.’ Even that dog from Blue’s Clues is like, ‘I need a challenge here, guys, we all know what this is, right?’” “I mean, if one guy stormed the Capitol because he thought you said it to him, maybe you could just blame him,” Noah added. “But if an entire stadium of people misunderstood you in the exact same way? I don’t know, man, that shit’s on you.” If there’s one theme to the trial “aside from Trump being super guilty”, Noah continued, “it’s Republican senators not caring that Trump is super guilty”. Throughout the week, GOP senators including Rand Paul, Josh Hawley and Rick Scott have been spotted tuning out the proceedings – doodling in their notebooks, or reading about other topics as House impeachment managers presented their evidence. “These senators are a jury for a trial of the president, but instead they’re acting like bored middle-schoolers,” Noah said. “What do Democrats have to do to make this interesting for them? Bring in one of those math teachers who raps everything?” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert played clips from Congressman Jamie Raskin’s closing argument for the prosecution, in which he directly addressed Trump’s defense team: “Just in general, if a president incited a violent insurrection against our government, would that be a high crime and misdemeanor?” “Man, he actually had to ask that question!” Colbert marveled. “The bar has gotten that low. And someone should pick it up quick before some Maga bro uses it to beat a cop.” In all seriousness, Colbert later added, there was one thing all House impeachment managers had in common throughout the trial: “they weren’t grandstanding for their own egos. They were clearly, deeply, sincerely, desperately trying to make any human connection as fellow citizens to the Republican senators in that gallery, and convince them to put country before party.” “So, doomed from the start,” he joked, as Senate Republicans “are doing exactly what they did on 6 January: running away from what they helped create”. Watching the conclusion of the House’s case against Trump was “like the Empire Strikes Back”, said Jimmy Kimmel. “We already know how it ends, but we’re watching it anyway.” Democrats “could produce a video of Trump looking straight into the camera saying ‘I, Donald Trump, hereby incite this insurrection of violence,’ and most of the Republican senators would be like, ‘But where’s the proof? We didn’t see proof,’” he added. Conviction remains highly unlikely, Kimmel explained, as most Republican senators either support the ex-president or are too scared of angering his base to vote against him. “Here’s the thing: if Americans cared as much about America as we do about Britney Spears, this would be a really great place to live,” he said. Most observers expect the GOP senators to vote in the ex-president’s favor, even though Trump’s argument, according to Kimmel, is “basically, ‘Yes, maybe I did shout “fire” in a crowded theater, but the people trampling each other were acting on their own.’” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers zeroed in on Marco Rubio, the former GOP senator from Florida, who in five years has morphed from vocal critic of Trump to staunch supporter. Meyers played a Rubio clip from this week, in which he called impeachment a “waste of our time” as it didn’t vaccinate people or provide jobs. “How many people are gonna get superpowers from this impeachment trial? None,” Meyers deadpanned. “How many people are gonna fall in love because of this impeachment trial? None. How many people are gonna win the McDonald’s Monopoly million-dollar grand prize by collecting all four railroads from containers of large or medium-sized fries or McFlurries or apple pies? None. “That’s not what impeachment is for. You should be capable of doing two or three or even, God forbid, four things at once,” Meyers added, seriously. “If you really want to help people out, why not sign on to the Democrats’ Covid relief bill, or a $15 minimum wage?” When Trump dismissed the pandemic or encouraged people to “stick a few Tide to-go pens up their noses, why didn’t you say anything?” Meyers continued, answer in hand: “Because you’re a boneless fraud.”"
"A lot of my favourite things from the mid-2000s haven’t held up, but here’s one that has: Saving Face, an underappreciated lesbian romantic comedy that was way ahead of its time – or maybe it’s more that the rest of the genre is still lagging behind. Saving Face was the feature film debut for writer and director Alice Wu, a Taiwanese-American lesbian who drew, in part, from her own story. It would be 16 years before she saw the release of her second film, The Half of It, which came out on Netflix last year. Michelle Krusiec plays Wilhelmina Pang, or Wil, a closeted young doctor in New York. She’s cute in a slouchy, ponytailed, running-for-the-subway-in-sweatpants-while-things-fall-out-of-her-backpack sort of way. Her mother Hwei-Lan, played by the always magnetic Joan Chen (Twin Peaks, Home Song Stories), keeps trying to set her up with eligible bachelors at Chinese community events. As a reluctant but dutiful daughter, Wil goes along with the farce but dodges the would-be suitors. Instead, one of these awkward buffet dinners leads her to Vivian Shing (Lynn Chen, no relation), a dancer who’s on a sabbatical from the New York City Ballet as she follows her passion for contemporary dance, disappointing her surgeon father who also happens to be Wil’s boss. What follows could be a stock-standard story of star-crossed young lesbians fighting for love while a narrow-minded community closes in on them. I’ve seen a hundred versions of that story at queer film festivals, with just the setting and hairstyles changed, and not all of them are bad. But that’s not the story here. Wu adds a second plot in which Wil’s ma moves in with her after falling pregnant. As a 40-something widow who has not remarried, Hwei-Lan finds herself shunned by her community when the news gets out, but she refuses to say who the child’s father is. Soon, Hwei-Lan’s father is also trying to marry her off, and so begins another parade of hideously ill-matched bachelors. Wil is shoehorned into playing matchmaker, and mediating between her mother and grandfather. As an aside, people will try to persuade you that “saving face” is a peculiarly Chinese concept, but I’m not convinced. Authoritarian patriarchs everywhere are obsessed with their moral reputation over their ethical conduct. They rarely take kindly to being questioned or corrected. So often, it’s daughters whose freedom is traded for face. In fact, I was intrigued to see that a new lesbian romcom, Happiest Season, deals with these same issues of honour, reputation and repression in a white American family. In Saving Face, the parallel mother-daughter stories elevate the film, offering a refreshing tale of queer-straight solidarity against patriarchy and a repudiation of fear, shame, pride and prejudice. All the characters are flawed – bigoted, domineering, gutless – but none feel entirely villainous. Jin Wang is particularly impressive as the officious grandpa, bringing an endearing vulnerability to his performance even when his actions are callous. With his stubbornness, tai chi practice, and poetic turns of phrase, he embodies a familiar archetype of the scholarly Chinese patriarch. The dialogue flows naturally between English, Mandarin and Shanghainese, and acidic jokes hole-punch light into the heavier scenes. The film satisfies as a romcom. It’s got all the elements: the meet-cute, the banter, the flirting over a vending machine (a motif that Wu returned to in The Half of It), the unspoken intimacies and the slightly surprising match. The chemistry between Wil and Vivian is believable and heightened with the judicious use of a Cat Power cover of Lou Reed. Nowadays, there’s much more appreciation for diverse stories and filmmakers in the romcom genre, which is exciting to see. Everyone needs something fluffy now and then. But while big-budget, star-studded films such as Crazy Rich Asians and Happiest Season were released to much fanfare, Saving Face opened at just six cinemas when it came out in the US in 2005, following its premiere the year before at the Toronto international film festival. Wu faced predictable struggles when making the film, too: she told the New York Times that studio executives wanted her to make the lead characters white, or straight, and asked for less Mandarin. Over the years, Saving Face has become a staple of the gaysian cinematic diet. I feel incredibly lucky that this film exists. It’s surreal, as a queer person of Shanghainese heritage, to hear my mother tongue – which appears in so little media – in a lesbian romcom of all places. As we head into the Year of the Ox, I reckon this is the perfect movie to celebrate family and community while also challenging the poisonous dynamics that continue to prevail. Both the story and Wu’s filmmaking career might also teach us something about patience, determination, and knowing when to put a hoof down."
"Aspiring film-makers take note: a love triangle, a gun, and a pile of illicit cash is as reliable a recipe for a debut feature as any. That was the scheme followed by the Coen brothers in 1984’s Blood Simple, and it worked as well for siblings Lana and Lilly Wachowski in 1996’s Bound. The fact that the Wachowskis immediately went to stratospheric heights in their next film, The Matrix, means their debut has had the status of an afterthought even for diehard fans. Word was that Bound was only ever a stepping stone, its $6m budget – petty cash to any post-Matrix blockbuster – offered only to prove they could run a set. But watch the film now and you’ll find not only an immaculately crafted neo-noir, but also a skeleton key to the sisters’ entire career. It begins with a classic noir set-up: ex-con Corky falls in lust with tough dame Violet, and is lured into a double-cross against Violet’s beau Caesar, a money launderer for the mob. The twist, if it is one, is that our leads are both women; Corky is played by Gina Gershon, and Violet by the husky-voiced Jennifer Tilly. When Caesar (Joe Pantoliano) comes into possession of $2m that needs to be returned to the capo post haste, Corky and Violet plot to swipe the bag. Their plan involves putting Caesar on the hook for the missing money, thinking he’ll be dumb enough not to sense they screwed him and smart enough to go on the run and out of their lives. They only get the first part right. Instead of skipping town, Caesar digs in deeper, and the plot unfolds as a cunning pressure-cooker thriller, with all parties scheming to survive the night until the mob arrives in force to sort matters out at the barrel of a gun. This sounds like a bit of a leap to the techno-philosophical kung fu action of the Wachowskis’ next films, but shut your eyes and listen to composer Don Davis’ nervy audio stings, or close your ears and clock the procession of key objects and locations – analog telephones and gloomy mid-century apartments – and you’ll register a set of stylistic seeds taking root. The comic book look of the Matrix films always generated talk, but here in a minor mode you appreciate what the Wachowskis’ graphic sensibility adds to their storytelling. Years before the much-imitated “bullet time”, the sisters were giving their gunfire kinetic visual accentuation in the form of shattering picture frames and swirls of spilt paint. In 1996, a neo-noir with dual femmes fatale couldn’t avoid being slotted alongside that decade’s surge of erotic thrillers, like the iconic Basic Instinct (1992), which for its own dubious take on a bisexual love triangle had been picketed by LGBTQ+ activists. Such films turned sex into a plastic spectacle and power trip, motivated as much by a critique of consumerist individualism as by their makers’ mercenary sense of the American public’s appetite for vanilla kink. But Bound stands out for the way it invests its genre tropes with unabashed romantic sincerity. The erotics of the scenario are certainly foregrounded – when Violet puts the moves on Corky by inviting her over to do some light plumbing, the Wachowskis make the image of a leaky kitchen pipe into something hilariously suggestive – but beyond the frisson generated between the leads what you really notice is that they genuinely seem to be delighted by each other. Whereas other erotic thrillers had a (sometimes self-reflexive) misogynistic tinge, Bound’s feminist implications are unmuddied – these women want out of patriarchal mob society, and the film wants them to get there. That also makes Bound the seed for the escape fantasy that struck a chord in The Matrix. In both films we see star-crossed lovers seeking to escape an oppressive power structure that is unmistakably masculine in image, its violent enforcers incarnated as sneering goons in sharply tailored business suits. “Love liberates all” has been the dominant theme for the Wachowskis, even behind their most monumental CGI spectacles. But realised here on the smallest scale at which they will probably ever, ever work, it comes through most persuasively."
"While the UK does not have any cultural treasures on the Unesco world heritage “in danger” list, concerns have been raised about developments at Stonehenge and other cultural landmarks. Unesco has confirmed Stonehenge would be added to its heritage in danger list, and could be stripped of its world heritage site status if a £2.4bn highway tunnel is permitted to be built as planned. It said that despite efforts to soften the impact, the proposed two-mile tunnel would irreversibly damage an area of outstanding universal value. Archaeologists, local campaigners and even the nation’s druids launched a court battle to block the development, arguing that the transport secretary’s approval of the proposal did not factor in the potential damage to the prehistoric sites surrounding Stonehenge. Supporters donated thousands of pounds to boost the legal fight. The scheme, which was rubber-stamped by the government in November, threatens to destroy up to half a million artefacts, according to Prof Mike Pearson, archaeologist and member of the independent A303 Scientific Committee. Branded “the Golden Turd” by critics, a new five-star hotel in one of Edinburgh’s most sought-after retail hubs, the St James Quarter, has sparked outrage among architectural heritage campaigners. Due to open next year, the retail-hotel-housing behemoth, situated in Edinburgh’s world heritage site, will boast 214 guest rooms, which includes 20 suites and an “Extreme Wow suite”, the W hotel’s name for its presidential suite. Jutting out into the skyline, its spiralling bronze-coloured dome has received comparisons to the poo emoji, worthy of its own mock Twitter account (and the worst building of the year award 2020). It received planning permission in controversial circumstances in August 2015, in a split-decision by councillors against the recommendation of the city’s planners. Plans to build a £10m rum distillery biome heated by geothermal energy have stoked fears that Cornwall and west Devon may lose its heritage status. The distillery would harness excess energy from the UK’s first geothermal plant built nearby to “tropically” mature rum in four pods that mimic Caribbean temperatures. Much of the landscape in Cornwall and Devon was transformed during the Industrial Revolution to make way for underground mines, engine houses, ports and harbours, which together have given the area special mining significance. Historic England, the government’s adviser on environmental heritage, said it had “strong concerns” about the proposal to create the sustainably run facility inside a biome, with a visitor centre and bar, at United Downs in Cornwall’s treasured mining plot. The plans were challenged by the leaseholder of the land, Purple Cornwall Ltd, which organises stock car racing at the United Downs Raceway. “We don’t oppose these sorts of projects in Cornwall, but we want to protect our raceway. It’s one of the few things young people can do,” Crispen Rosevear, who manages track events, told the i. Residents also took part in a 10-hour run to raise funds in support of the cause. In 2013, the capital’s international heritage status was cast into doubt after planning permission was granted for a £800m skyscraper, Elizabeth House, to be built next to Waterloo station. Westminster city council, along with English Heritage, said the 29-storey office block would blight the Westminster world heritage site by obscuring views of much-loved landmarks such as the Palace of Westminster. “The proposed building is ill-conceived, overly large, and of modest architectural quality. I am far from alone in holding this opinion,” wrote Robert Davis, Westminster city council’s deputy leader, in a letter to Lambeth council, which had given the development the green light alongside the Greater London Authority and the government’s communities department. The project went ahead, and Unesco decided not to put Westminster on its endangered list as it had previously intended. The cultural watchdog pinpointed weaknesses in UK planning laws and called for legal protection for heritage sites to be strengthened. World Heritage Watch (WHW), a global non-profit organisation which advises Unesco, sounded the alarm in 2018 that the Lake District’s world heritage status is being threatened by 4x4 vehicles. It published a report criticising the environmental damage, particularly at Tilberthwaite, caused by the use of off-roaders. Campaigners have faced a long-running battle with the Lake District national park authority (LDNPA), which last year went to the high court after it granted 4x4s and motorbikes access to two old farm and quarry tracks, known as green lanes, in the Langdale and Coniston valleys. They argued that cars and motorbikes had eroded farm tracks, churning up soil and spoiling the area for visitors. “In its bid for world heritage status the LDNPA used the very attributes of outstanding universal value that are now being damaged,” said Stephan Dömpke, the chairman of the WHW. The advisory body asked Unesco to make the Lake District’s continued inscription as a world heritage site dependent on the LDNPA acting to prevent further damage caused by the vehicles."
"The primary function of a music festival is escapism; the music is often secondary. So what do we make of a virtual festival experience like this past weekend’s Splendour XR? Funded with $1.5m in Australian government Rise funding and hosted on virtual reality platform Sansar, the two-day online iteration of Splendour in the Grass promised “a world-first online experience”: “A virtual world where music, art and culture reigns supreme. Where lockdowns and social distancing don’t exist. Where mesmerised mobs dance in the forest to the freshest beats.” In other words, the festival – which cost $50 for a two-day ticket, $30 for one day – would be a virtual concert experience more elevated than grassroots streaming festivals like Isol-Aid, and less predetermined than the high-budget spectacles offered by Billie Eilish and Dua Lipa. It’s a noble goal, but one immediately drowned out by dissonance: Splendour XR was clearly meant as an alternative to the drudgery of pandemic life, but the internet is unfortunately the exact site of anxiety many are attempting to break free from right now. Unlike Splendour in the Grass, where one’s phone may die or lose reception, during Splendour XR I can flick to my inbox or my Instagram at a second’s notice (try as I might not to) – and after months spent inside, a weekend on the internet feels like no escapism at all. It’s a perverse blessing for the organisers of the festival that, due to lockdowns in parts of Australia, much of Splendour XR’s key audience would have been spending this weekend online anyway. Entering the virtual world, I am asked to pick from a set of prefabricated avatars. Many are wearing Nike – a forced brand interaction that, if anything, feels very true to the spirit of most music festivals. When I’m finally “inside”, I’m surprised at how little genuine functionality there is. From the festival’s marketing, I assumed that I’d be able to “walk” around the festival site to each stage and to different stalls, not unlike last year’s in-world Minecraft festivals that featured artists like 100 gecs and Charli XCX. Alas, no: the ability to walk between stages, it turns out, is limited to those with VR sets and gaming PCs; the rest of us have to just click around. Upon entry to the festival site, I am offered different “camera angles”, each showing me a different tent – ticket booth, merchandise, a bar and so on – with each sending me to an outlet where I can spend money. If I want drinks, I can click out from the bar to a third-party website and order myself some delivered booze. If I want merchandise, I can go to another third-party site. If I want a pair of Nike Huaraches, the Nike tent will direct me to the Nike website to learn more. And if I want to see how much fun everyone else is having, I can check out the social media wall, which shows me blurry Instagram photos of attendees wearing festival outfits while sitting at their computers. Most bizarrely, there is a police stall with no interactivity whatsoever. (Thankfully, unlike at the real Splendour in the Grass, they are unable to unlawfully strip-search teens here.) These zones are eerily static, a handful of virtual avatars moving back and forth occasionally as if I’m watching a looped gif. In the chat to the right of my festival screen, I can communicate with my fellow attendees. Many, it seems, are having technical difficulties – lag despite using a gaming PC, sound garbled on an iPad, VR glitching out. When I click into one of the handful of stages available for viewing, the stream defaults to the prerecorded live set of whichever band is playing. I am then offered the opportunity to view the stream as if from the crowd, which superimposes a kind of frame on top of the stream, adding fake lights and fake crowd members. Client Liaison’s easily digestible pastiche of 80s pop was pretty much made for festivals, but watching with the fake crowd, all I can think of is what this experience lacks. Perhaps this would be enjoyable for those watching with friends, but that seems like an unlikely prospect when so many in Australia are in lockdown. Similarly, a set from the snotty and wonderful Sunshine Coast punk band the Chats mostly elicits a kind of blithe curiosity, rather than the frenzied rush that I imagine one of their real-life live gigs might. My attention drifts to the edges of the scene: Was this filmed at the Croxton Bandroom? Is that avatar dancing right in front of me a glitch? … Is that the beep of the washing machine? When it comes time for the first night’s headliners, an age-old festival conundrum emerges: Denzel Curry and Phoebe Bridgers are playing at roughly the same time. (I wonder initially why a utopian virtual festival would have any clashes at all, before realising that – of course – on-demand viewing of missed sets is a $20 add-on.) My instinct is to watch Curry, a Floridian rapper who puts on a pummelling, frantic live show – but featuring just Curry and a DJ, his low-production set is strangely disconnected. I leave it for Bridgers, but her set is one of many, many livestreams she’s done off the back of her acclaimed album Punisher, and there’s little to differentiate this from the others. When the main camera stream fails to show video during the first few minutes, it doesn’t feel worth it to wait. I wander – or, rather, click – over to the Tipi Forest, to watch an anonymous DJ play anonymous EDM. I would need many, many friends around to enjoy this. On my second day at Splendour XR, I resolve to find fun outside the carousel of prerecorded sets. The programming beyond the main stages is not unlike the kind of prerecorded video content I might watch on YouTube to pass the time: I catch a conversation between Grace Tame and Tarang Chawla at the Forum, before clicking over to the Global Village, where I see a guy in head-to-toe leather lip-syncing to Queen while juggling. Ultimately, though, there’s only so long you can spend in one of the festival’s extraneous zones when just watching through a laptop monitor. I flick over to the Amphitheatre to watch the Jungle Giants and see frontman Sam Hales begin clapping as if to lead an audience, despite clearly being alone with his band. It is admirable that these sets were recorded with the intention of capturing a genuine live set experience, but again it’s overwhelmed by a profound sense of uncanniness – as when Hot Dub Time Machine cycles through rote vintage hits such as The Chain and Take On Me while asking the “crowd” to sing along “louder”. The Avalanches’ set, filmed at one of their recent Enmore Theatre shows, at least includes crowd shots, which gives the whole thing the redolence of a concert film as opposed to the visceral emptiness of some other sets. Theirs is perhaps the most musically impressive too, an erudite and impeccably structured DJ set highlighting songs from their stunning 2020 record We Will Always Love You. A peak of my weekend is hearing them mash-up We Go On with Queen’s I Want To Break Free, an inspired moment that, at an ordinary festival, you could imagine people talking about for months. Without people to share it with, though, the moment feels like ephemera. Like anything else I might see online on a given day, it makes me smile and then slides away. Another drawcard is British underground electronic act Charli XCX. Her live show is uniquely adaptable: at a festival, she’ll play a set featuring her hits (I Love It, Boom Clap, a Spice Girls cover, and so on) and at a headline show she’ll play the songs that have made her an underground star (Vroom Vroom, Femmebot, Backseat). She performs the former set for Splendour XR – but her hardcore fans, having clearly bought one-day passes just to see her, begin to flood the chat asking her for her lesser-known songs. Charli’s performance seems to be optimised for VR, and without a headset it’s lacklustre and repetitive, the pop star dancing back and forth in a tiny patch of screen, with none of the artistic sheen of some earlier sets. Charli, without a crowd, comes off a little disinterested, while those watching seem perplexed and let down; it all has the air of something none of us wanted a part in but which everybody is partaking in anyway. Where the failure of Charli’s set seemed to lie in a misinterpretation about what Splendour XR actually is, Grimes and her team have it pegged: a branding opportunity. Halfway through Charli’s set, news comes through that viewers will have to move to the popular messaging network Discord to watch Grimes play. She has a partnership with Discord and stars in its new ad campaign, making this forced migration a particularly galling move: in addition to getting her presumably hefty (grant-funded!) Splendour XR headliner fee, Grimes gets a whole host of new users signing up to her Discord server – and, presumably, gets their data too. Any user who bought a Splendour XR ticket just to see Grimes is, then, effectively stooged – they could have just waited for the announcement that Grimes’ set was moving to the free platform and signed up. Adding insult to injury, the set Grimes ended up streaming on Discord was an audio-only DJ set – enjoyable for some, undoubtedly, but a far cry from the promise of Splendour XR. The moment represented the festival’s broader failure: far from providing an escape from Covid and lockdown, Splendour XR mostly revealed just how much we’ve lost."
"Helen, I am seeing an image on the internet that reminds me of a time long, long ago, but I can’t quite put my finger on what it means. You must be talking about singer, songwriter, actor, fragrance mogul and philanthropist Jennifer Lopez’s 52nd birthday pics and in particular, the pièce de résistance: Ben Affleck affectionately touching her butt. That’s the one. Why does it give me a sense of deja vu? Well firstly, it is familiar to you because it is a recreation of a scene in J Lo’s 2002 music video for the song Jenny from the Block, in which Lopez argues that despite her success and considerable material wealth, she is still the same down to earth woman who grew up in Castle Hill, the Bronx. The lyrics include the lines: “Can’t forget to stay real / to me it’s like breathing”; “I stay grounded as the amounts roll in”; and “Don’t be fooled by the rocks that I got / I’m still (I’m still) Jenny from the block”. The music video is a stream of scenes made to look like paparazzi footage. In one scene, Affleck strokes Lopez’s butt adoringly as they sail on a yacht. Art critic John Berger teaches us that a photograph “isolates, preserves, and presents a moment taken from a continuum”. In this case, that continuum begins with Affleck and Lopez’s relationship, starting in 2002. In 2003, they called their wedding off with just days to go, due to “excessive media attention”. This is poignant because: see above music video. In 2004, they broke up. But in April this year, nearly two decades later, their romance was rekindled (though it only became Instagram official this weekend). I don’t normally care about pictures of celebrity couples, so why does this one warm my heart? Because it encapsulates hope. We can pretend, for a brief moment, that all the bad things that have happened since 2002 – the great recession, Trump, Brexit, Covid – didn’t actually happen at all. Lopez’s body has not aged. She is with Affleck, about whom she sang – on the album that included Jenny from the Block – “I love you, you’re perfect / A manifestation of my dreams / … / You will always be / My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend, and my king.” 2002 was also the year Ben Affleck won People Magazine’s sexiest man alive. What has he been up to since then? It’s a long, sad story, so I’ll focus on recent events. In late 2019, he started dating actor Ana D’Armas. This was arguably the beginning of a comeback from many, many years of messy sadness. But the relationship itself was short-lived. They broke up in January this year. You may remember that the artefacts of their romance included a life-sized cutout of the actress that someone was seen throwing out, and a photo of Affleck drinking from a Dunkin’ Donuts cup balanced on top of several packages. Wait, tell me more about the messy sadness. If I may return to Berger: a “great artist is a man whose life-time is consumed by struggle: partly against material circumstances, partly against incomprehension, partly against himself.” In no artist who has ever lived is this more clearly represented than in Benjamin Affleck. He is the poster-boy for smoking and being sad. He has done this while wearing a face mask over just his nose, with one hand in his pocket and his eyes closed, inhaling, as the Cut put it, “through the pain of his existence”, and while looking thin, on a balcony. He is also sad when he vapes. He has stared out at the sea while wearing a towel high up on his torso. But he turned his back on that sea, and tried again. “Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster,” wrote Nietzsche. Affleck has gazed into the abyss, but he looked away before it could gaze back at him. “Every exceptional work was the result of a prolonged successful struggle,” wrote Berger. “The phoenix must burn to rise from the ashes”, wrote someone on Twitter. Affleck walked so we could run. What does the Bennifer image mean to you, personally?For me, it is all about J Lo. In a series of pics from her birthday, she shows off her insane body. I am seven months pregnant and the chances of me having anything close to an ab any time soon are zero. And yet, J Lo makes me feel like it is all too possible, some day. Unrealistic expectations? Well, they’re real. She’s real. “I thought I told you,” etc. So, is it art? I leave you with this: “The uniqueness of the original now lies in it being the original of a reproduction. It is no longer what its image shows that strikes one as unique; its first meaning is no longer to be found in what it says, but in what it is.”"
"On Late Night, Seth Meyers discussed the arrest of another former Trump official. This time, it’s Tom Barrack, chairman of Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee, charged in federal court in Brooklyn this week with illegally lobbying for the United Arab Emirates, obstructing justice and making false statements to federal agents. According to federal prosecutors, Barrack capitalized on his relationship with and access to Trump to “advance the policy goals of a foreign government without disclosing his] true allegiances”. “So one of Trump’s closest confidants and advisers was secretly using his access and connection to Trump to lobby the campaign and the administration as the unregistered agent of a foreign government,” Meyers explained. “That means various Trump associates were either lobbying for or connected to Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, Qatar and the UAE, among others. That place was like the Epcot world showcase of corruption. “This was supposed to be the America First campaign, the new working-class GOP,” he added. “Instead it was all a bunch of millionaire lobbyists, bankers, consultants and private equity titans working for foreign countries. His so-called America First campaign was a bigger scam than Subway tuna.” Meyers pointed to one example of Barrack’s alleged conspiracy: in 2016, he emailed a draft of a Trump energy speech to Emirati officials, and added an edit about the “importance of working with our Gulf allies” at their behest. “So thanks to Barrack, the UAE basically hired Trump to do a Cameo for them – ‘UAE, it’s Donald Trump, and I hear you have a birthday coming up,’” Meyers joked. “The Trump campaign and presidency was one big criminal enterprise,” he concluded, “a toxic cesspool of corruption and self-enrichment, and clearly there’s still so much more we need to find out.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert lamented the rise of Covid cases across the country, as vaccination rates stall and the highly transmissible Delta variant spreads. “Think of it like a pie,” said Colbert of current US vaccination rates. “About half of the pie would be vaccinated, while the other half wouldn’t be able to taste the pie because they have Covid.” The spread of the Delta variant is fueled by vaccine hesitancy, Colbert explained, “which is itself being fueled by a dangerous pathogen scientists are calling the Republican party”. The uptick in cases is perhaps why even GOP leaders like Mitch McConnell are publicly urging people to get the vaccine. Speaking to reporters this week, the Senate minority leader encouraged Americans to “ignore all of these other voices that are giving demonstrably bad advice”. “Wow, I gotta say, and I hope no one ever takes this out of context, I agree with Mitch McConnell,” said Colbert. In other Washington news, disputes continue over the select committee convened by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to investigate the causes of the 6 January siege of the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Earlier this week, the minority leader and Trump stalwart, Kevin McCarthy, announced his five selections for the panel, “and there seems to be one common denominator to all of the minority leader’s choices: no minority choices,” Colbert joked about the all-white, all-male Republican panel. “It’s an ad for inferior bleach because those are a bunch of dull whites.” McCarthy’s picks include the Ohio congressman Jim Jordan, who has previously disparaged the investigation. “Putting him on the commission is like if Silence of the Lambs ended with deputizing Buffalo Bill,” Colbert mused. On Wednesday, Pelosi rejected Jordan and fellow Republican congressman Jim Banks on account of this comments in support of Trump, whom the committee is investigating; the two might “jeopardize the integrity of the investigation”, she said. “Of course! They’re two potential suspects,” Colbert added. “Nancy Pelosi can’t just look the other way – she’s not Jim Jordan in the showers at Ohio State.”"
"You’ve already devoured Schitt’s Creek. You’ve run out of Ted Lasso. You’ve ploughed through Parks and Recreation and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and your soul hungers for more. You need another sitcom where you can lose yourself in the stories of basically good people who are just trying their often-inadequate best. I have good news to share. Superstore has regularly flicked up on my Netflix recommendations and I always happily scrolled past without a second thought. After all, there have been so very many utterly ghastly contemporary sitcoms about Wacky Shenanigans In A Department Store that the mere sight of someone with a shopping cart was like a flash of red on a prey animal: don’t touch this, for only poison awaits. (“Remember how you tried to watch Trollied?” it seemed to whisper, “Or, dear god, Rostered On? This way lies only pain.”) I would have clicked sooner had I realised that the stars included Ugly Betty’s America Ferrera, Mad Men’s Ben Feldman and legitimate comedy royal Mark McKinney, one-fifth of the legendary Canadian sketch troupe The Kids In the Hall. Instead, I knew nothing about the show when, in a TV dry spell, I eventually clicked play on the first episode. I figured it would become one of the many sitcoms I opted out of 20 minutes in and which lived on forever in my “Continue Watching?” queue. How wrong I was. The show was created by Julian Spitzer, one of the writers on the US version of The Office (the same writers room which launched Michael Schur, the genius behind The Good Place, Parks & Rec, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and the new Rutherford Falls) – and Superstore shares that show’s commitment to diverse ensemble casts and a breakneck laughs-per-minute rate. It’s set in Cloud 9, a big box retailer of the Walmart/Target stripe, and follows the lives, loves and unidentifiable smells of the floor staff: exhausted sales associate Amy Sosa (Ferrera), college dropout new hire Jonah Simms (Feldman), haughtily catty undocumented immigrant Mateo Liwanag (Nico Santos), teenage mother-slash-would-be-influencer Cheyenne Thompson (Nichole Sakura), aggressively filterless assistant manager Dina Fox (Lauren Ash) and gormless store manager Glenn Sturgis (McKinney). The core ensemble are a powerhouse, but the supporting cast are equally first-rate comedic actors – especially Kaliko Kauahi, an extra promoted to the regular cast due to her amazing performance as the endlessly put-upon Sandra Kaluiokalani. What’s especially brilliant about the show is that manages to deftly address real world issues, including the perils of non-union workplaces, the utter horror that is the American healthcare system, immigrants in the Trump era, corporate indifference to worker safety, the Black Lives Matter movement. In the sixth and final season, the pandemic hits, and the staff of Cloud 9 are simultaneously hailed as heroes by their corporate overlords, and forced to cut up unsold teddybears to make their own PPE. And if that sounds horribly po-faced, be advised that Superstore is also gloriously, hilariously, gleefully stupid. Most shows would shy from a running joke about random feet being discovered in the store, speculation about the genitals of Cloud 9’s apparently sexually active corporate logo, or whether Radiohead’s Creep is the right ukulele song to perform at a funeral. Another reason it can deal with quote-unquote issues without disappearing up its own woke-hole is Feldman’s elegant portrayal of Jonah as a well-meaning lefty who is as great at identifying everything that’s wrong with America as he is bad at enacting any sort of positive change. It contrasts neatly with the more pragmatic Amy who admires his well-meaning middle-class idealism even while pointing out it’s something she, as a child of working-class immigrants, absolutely cannot afford. The main thing a comedy needs of course is to be is funny, which Superstore comprehensively is. But it’s hard to think of too many US comedies where the protagonists are working poor who don’t live in implausibly enormous apartments – much less in a world where a change in hours or a loss of childcare is a dramatic beat as much as a comedic one. There’s Roseanne, of course and then … what? In a few years this will be a time capsule of a sort of shopping experience entirely replaced by Amazon drones and gig slavery. But for now, let it be a reminder that our frontline retail workers are the real heroes of the pandemic. As long as they supply their own masks, obviously."
"Stephen Colbert kicked off Monday’s Late Show with concerning updates on the coronavirus, as cases rose in all 50 states over the last week. The increase is largely due to the more transmissible Delta variant, which “sounds like a frat house that’s a disease vector,” he said. “So … a frat house.” The surge has led Los Angeles county to reinstate indoor mask requirements regardless of vaccination status. “Typical Los Angeles – even the virus is pitching a sequel.” The vast majority of infections have been among unvaccinated people, adding pressure to the Biden administration to combat vaccine hesitancy fostered by rampant misinformation online, particularly on Facebook. This week, the US surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, warned that misinformation was a “serious threat to public health”. “Makes you miss the good old days when Facebook’s primary function was helping you find unflattering pictures of your ex’s new boyfriend,” Colbert added. The virus has also threatened the Olympics on the eve of their kick-off in Tokyo; on Monday, the number of Covid cases linked to the Olympics rose to 61. “I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: it was wrong to make tonsil hockey an Olympic sport,” said Colbert. “At this rate there’s not going to be any healthy humans left to compete in the Games. “The Olympics organizers are doing everything they can to prevent the spread of Covid,” he added, as rumors circulated that the International Olympic Committee outfitted the Olympic Village with “anti-sex” beds designed to collapse under the weight of more than one person. “Yes, because we know if there is one thing world-class athletes can’t do, it’s have sex in unusual positions,” Colbert quipped. Factcheckers later debunked the anti-sex rumors, claiming the beds were made of cardboard so that they could be recycled into paper products after the Olympics. “I can’t wait for six months from now to read toilet paper labels that read ‘made from 100% recycled Olympic sex bed’,” Colbert joked. “And athletes, remember: if you’re recycling, you have to break down your Olympic sex bed.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers discussed a report that Donald Trump has struggled to sell advance tickets for a series of rallies with the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, billed as “The History Tour”. In Orlando, where the duo will host an event on 12 December at the 20,000-capacity Amway Center, a box office employee told Politico that there were “still a lot of tickets open. We have concerts that are doing a lot better than this.” “I’m sure they do,” said Meyers. “First of all, it’s in Orlando. There’s a wealth of theme parks. Why go to a Trump/O’Reilly history tour when you can learn more about American history at the Hall of Presidents or even Space Mountain. Hell, even Sea World would be a better use of your time. Either way, you’re gonna be in the splash zone. “Who the hell wants to go see a so-called history tour with a disgraced former cable news host and a man who was just quoted as having said ‘I think it would be hard if George Washington came back from the dead and he chose Abraham Lincoln as his vice-president. I think it would be very hard for them to beat me.’ “A history tour with Trump is like the opposite of a Ken Burns documentary,” he added. “Let’s remember, Trump thought Frederick Douglass was still alive and thought the civil war happened for no reason.” In response to the Politico story, O’Reilly, who was fired from Fox News in 2017 after it was revealed the network paid $32m to settle a sexual harassment claim, threatened to sue the reporter and called low ticket sales “bullshit”. When asked how many tickets were sold, he said he didn’t know. “It’s nice to know O’Reilly hasn’t chilled out even a little bit given all that time to relax after he got canned,” Meyers deadpanned. “I guess part of me thought when you get forced out and publicly disgraced the way O’Reilly did, you might take up yoga or meditation. Although even if he did, he’d probably still do it angrily. “It makes sense that ticket sales are slow, because even the people who want to go see Trump don’t want a history lecture,” Meyers continued. “They want him to get up on stage and say crazy shit about celebrities he met in 1982.”"
"In the early 2000s, having just started her eponymous law firm in Sydney, Meriam and Wuthathi woman Terri Janke travelled to her birthplace of Cairns to speak about protecting Indigenous art and knowledge to empower the local community. The Cairns local newspaper dubbed her a “cultural crusader”, which shocked her: the front page story made her feel like an “impostor” and “big noter”. Flying out of Cairns, a Torres Strait woman reading the newspaper in the next seat recognised her. “Well done, girl,” said the elder, “you can stop this theft of our cultural knowledge”. Janke told the woman she still had so much to do. “You be strong,” the elder countered. “You’ve just got to stay on track and, if you listen with your heart, they will be true tracks. People will follow.” The woman’s words let Janke’s “skin breathe”. She realised she wasn’t alone. In the 1990s, Janke spent three years writing a paper on Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights, inspired after working at the National Indigenous Arts Advocacy Association, and advising a legal team in a successful copyright action brought by eight Aboriginal artists against a carpet company which had reproduced their artworks without permission. Since then, Janke created and finessed her True Tracks framework of Australian Indigenous cultural and intellectual property principles, developing protocols for the Australia Council, Screen Australia, the City of Sydney and LendLease. Overseas law firms, including from Canada and New Zealand, have sought Janke’s advice on the protocols, which cover respect, self-determination, consent and consultation, interpretation, integrity, secrecy and privacy, attribution, benefit sharing, maintaining Indigenous cultures, recognition and protection. She emphasises the protocols should be written into legal contracts. Over this time, Janke has also built a case to establish a national Indigenous cultural authority, that would help protect culture and knowledge. “It would be the first step,” Janke tells Guardian Australia. “It might not be a one-stop shop, but there’s a lot of legwork for people working out who to speak to, and an authority could be really useful in raising awareness and capacity, giving Indigenous people the space to control their arts and their culture.” Her new book True Tracks is a resource for respecting Indigenous knowledge and culture, which draws on 20 years of her work. In it, Janke writes of the first eight years of her life, being a “young black kid with few prospects” in Cairns who was “made to feel ashamed of my culture”. Her journalist father John and sister Toni – a lawyer and singer – encouraged her to study law, instilling in her a passion for social justice. Janke says greater protection is needed for the “large body of oral and generationally transmitted Indigenous knowledge” excluded under Australia’s standard patent system which requires written applications. So, for example, a patent can be registered by a person who is simply told by an Indigenous person about a plant’s healing properties. The World Intellectual Property Organization’s intergovernmental committee is considering requiring applicants to fully disclose the source of their inventions, says Janke, which could “trigger access and benefit sharing agreements” in accordance with the Nagoya Protocol and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Janke wants to see that protocol ratified and implemented in Australia. “We have confusion on both parts, Indigenous and non-Indigenous. It needs a lot more transparency. We need a coordinated approach between the Commonwealth and states.” As Australian senators repeatedly fail to pass bills that would stop the sale of fake Aboriginal art, Janke is optimistic that QR codes can be used to verify authorship – with buyers using their phones to scan codes affixed to artworks. Ultimately, she says, “there is also growing consumer awareness of not wanting to buy bogus things, and consumers could drive changes in the law”. Her book also discusses how the Australian legal system offers limited protection for Indigenous traditional design, citing the unauthorised reproduction of the Wandjina, a sacred rainmaker spirit often depicted in Kimberley rock forms by the Worrorra, Ngarinyin and Wunambal Gaambera peoples. The Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Cultural Centre eventually trademarked the Wandjina. “It really isn’t good enough protection, but it is one way of saying, if you use it commercially, [the custodian groups] own it.” Meanwhile the exclusive licensing arrangements held by non-Indigenous people of the Aboriginal flag designed by Luritja artist Harold Thomas has caused “growing distress” in Indigenous communities, Janke says. In 2020, a Senate inquiry rejected calls for the federal government to invoke its constitutional power to compulsorily acquire the copyright in the artwork as well as licenses to reproduce the flag design, which would free up its wider use. Janke believes compulsory acquisition is the best way to resolve the issue. “Then you’ve got a question of ownership, so you need it to be guarded by the right people and attribution to the artist who designed it. It’s got a history that needs to be told, and consistently linked to, and the moral rights need to be adhered to.” Janke’s firm also helped develop the governance framework for the online platform of the Keeping Place Project, a repatriation effort shared by traditional owner groups and resource companies in the Pilbara. Given Rio Tinto blew up sacred Juukan Gorge in May 2020, perhaps the project has not been enough to ensure mining company respect? “There needs to be total changes in the heritage laws, around planning and much more forward-thinking and engaging with people,” Janke says. “Yes, Juukan Gorge happened, and it was totally devastating, but there’s been many like that, and there’s been some since. “You’ve got to think about how Australia values its cultural heritage. Australians will travel the world to see places in Mexico or Machu Picchu [in Peru] or Cambodia or Rome, but Australia has cultural landscapes and sites even older. “We are living in a country that has amazing world cultural heritage, and we need to be really respectful of it.” "
"Sam Campbell’s show The Trough was the most chaotic fun I’ve ever had. I got to be an audience plant for a few nights during the Edinburgh fringe, and even after seeing it five times I still cried with laughter every night. Tash and Ellie’s Mum’s the Word is perfection. Anything where a massive camel toe is a key part of the costume is a winner in my book. On purpose: This Country. Accidentally: Real Housewives of New York. I watched The Godfather for the first time ever in lockdown. It’s got so many iconic quotes that hearing them in their original context made them come across as a bit on the nose. Some audience members started chatting to each other quite loudly, so I asked what was going on. One of them turned to me and said: “It’s fine, you can finish your conversation.” Having my show referred to as a “conversation” has really kept me humble. I had a really bad 2019, so on New Year’s Eve I baked a cake with icing that said: “Thank god it’s over.” I would like to publicly apologise to the rest of the human population for jinxing it.

"Alicia Keys, I have a bone to pick with you. For the moments I spent at the back of the classroom imagining myself into the music video for You Don’t Know My Name. Me, all skin and bone and fantasy, scribbling tunnel-vision dreams on to the backs of school textbooks, distracted by the thought of an almost recklessly venturesome type of love; one that in any R&B music video would see me abruptly leave the room to run towards my lover in slow motion, them standing at the end of the corridor wearing a gold chain and diamante earring, the bridge building its way out into the final chorus. For all the sounds love gave us – from Teddy Pendergrass and Luther Vandross summoning screams of passion at concerts from a generation of women I’m still learning to understand, to SWV and Aaliyah drawing out the sensuality of vulnerability – it was you, Alicia, who consolidated a sound of romance I grew to recognise; a longing love that spanned generations but lived in the now. “Grown” but naive enough to live vicariously through. In my dreams I’d reenact the moment you call up Mos Def’s character “Michael”, picking up the house phone after 6pm when house-to-house calls were free, belling the landline of someone’s son. I’d swap the coffee house on 39th and Lennox for Mr Thompson’s maths class, and the fly blue suit with the shining cufflinks for the way he wore his white polo shirt under his school blazer, clocking his Just Do It bag sitting slanted across his torso like it belonged there. In retrospect, I had no business loving the way I did, but Alicia made love taste of something salty and sweet; of sneaking into the Cineworld at Southside with snacks from Asda, delegating some coin to a Tango Ice Blast and hoping, this time, they wouldn’t search our bags. Like something complex that shouldn’t work, and sometimes it didn’t, but when it did, wasn’t it wholesome? R&B did that to you, sending you into a trance of an unrivalled passion. So, maybe I have a bone to pick with R&B. For selling dreams of men dancing down high streets through all four elements, just to chirpse. For boys from ends singing Let Me Love You by Mario down the phone to girls they were attempting to move to, dropping the playground bravado for something sweeter. For So Sick by Ne-Yo being the go-to song to sing at any talent contest for a solid few years. But in all its rose-tinted nostalgia and infatuation, R&B has always been trifling. Songs about love weren’t always songs about love: Donell Jones being indecisive about what he wanted in a relationship, popping up outside the restaurant window like the Candyman once his girl found a new man in Where I Wanna Be; Jagged Edge’s Let’s Get Married sounding more desperate than romantic; Too Close by Next being just downright nasty, growing to realise “you’re making it hard for me” meant a different kind of fighting temptation.  I don’t buy into the idea of “old-school” R&B being this perfect execution of love and wanting and needing that’s slipping into an evanescence. I don’t believe in its rebrand of being the ultimate sound of love that younger generations are now flailing in comparison to. But something has changed. Love sounds distant now. Like muffled bass leaking through flimsy walls. Like foggy dreams fading into oblivion the morning after. Like some kind of hesitance towards the unsexiness of love; its compromise, its vulnerability, its openness and willingness to push through. How does love sound to a society that is hesitant towards its embrace? Maybe I have a bone to pick with us. For throwing back “who hurt you?” as a means of antagonising and passing blame instead of asking “how do you want to be loved?”. For reciting quotes from bell hooks’s All About Love on Twitter and avoiding the work it takes to adopt it as praxis in our offline lives. For sitting in a false nostalgia of how love supposedly once was, pushing perfectionist ideas of a different generation, while simultaneously minimising their love to a form of imprisonment. In the distant hum of what love once was, I still hear that song, that chorus, that melody, reminding me that, as messy and chaotic and indecisive as it is, R&B still holds our love close to us; a muscle memory that refuses to forget itself. Maybe one day we’ll circle back on this love, dusting off its cobwebs and pardoning its mistakes, holding ourselves to the promises we make to each other when we say I got you, meaning: I see you; meaning: I love you. And when these songs remind us of our past selves, I wonder how we’ll look back on this very moment. How future generations will look back on R&B, and whether they’ll still ask: “Who hurt R&B?”, and, “Who hurt us?” Tobi Kyeremateng is a cultural producer and writer"
"At the beginning of the pandemic Mae Martin’s first TV series, Feel Good, was broadcast on Channel 4 to great acclaim. Just recently, the second series came out on Netflix to even greater acclaim. While most of us have disappeared in lockdown, Martin has become a star. Feel Good is a disarmingly autobiographical love story. It tells the story of a character called Mae struggling with relationships, addiction, identity and life on the comedy circuit. Mae is attracted to men and women, but to women more, particularly women who identify as straight. The first series focuses on Mae’s relationship with Georgina, a teacher who had previously only slept with men and is reluctant to admit to her super-straight, super-posh friends that she and Mae are living together. Mae is a mix of streetwise and naive – reckless, precocious, promiscuous, self-absorbed and a bag of nerves. By the end of series two both characters have evolved. George is happy with her bisexuality, while Mae changes from she to they, announcing: “I think I’m transgender or non-binary or whatever the term is these days.” Mae has also begun to understand that their teenage relationships with older men were abusive and exploitative. Last week, Martin discovered how popular Feel Good is when visiting Trans Pride in London. “It felt amazing. People were being so nice. They were just coming up and talking to me.” Has Martin ever experienced this in the past? “Yes. I guess before Feel Good it was once a week-ish, and now it’s a couple of times a day.” Martin says when strangers approach, they act as if they are friends, asking the most intimate questions. “They feel like they really know me. And the mad thing is they kind of do. So we have deep conversations. They get right into it asking about addiction, relationships and gender.” It’s not surprising people react like this when you write and star in a TV series using your real name and telling a version of your life story. But this is where things start to get complicated. As Martin reminds me, it is a fictionalised version. So whereas in Feel Good, Mae talks about being trans or non-binary, Martin is non-binary but not trans. The Canadian standup thinks of Feel Good as a dramatised version of life 10 to 15 years ago. But while the addiction at the heart of the story goes back that far, the decision to identify as they rather than she is recent. And we’ve not quite done yet with the complications. While most interviewees tell you their life story, Martin is at times reluctant to, because it inevitably leads to a compare-and-contrast with the show, and becomes reductive. “You spend so long crafting what you want to put out there, and what would be the point of doing that if I’m going to go: ‘Actually, this is what happened.’” It may make Martin hard to write about, but it certainly doesn’t make Feel Good hard to watch. Martin is right – it is beautifully crafted. The script, by Martin and co-writer Joe Hampson, is spare and by turns funny, romantic, sexy, disturbing and moving; the performances (including Martin as Mae, Charlotte Ritchie as George and Lisa Kudrow as Mae’s mother) note perfect. If you mashed the comic absurdities of Fleabag and Catastrophe with the erotic intensity of Normal People you might get something like Feel Good. Martin lives in a chic flat in east London. On the floor is a rack of guitars; on the walls are photos of heroes such as the Beatles and Bob Dylan; and at the back of the living room is a cabinet of tiny trinkets, from brass pigs to a Victorian feng shui compass. On stage, Martin jokes about feeling like a member of the boyband Backstreet Boys. Today, at 34, they still could pass as one – beansprout-skinny, lithe and twitchily energetic. Martin grew up in Toronto to middle-class parents – a British writer father and a Canadian teacher mother. A recurring theme in Feel Good is Mae’s guilt about coming from privilege. In rehab, Mae meets people who didn’t stand a chance in life – they grew up in poverty; their parents were addicts. Both Mae the character and Martin the person were given every chance. Their parents were ex-hippies who gave their two children (Martin has an older brother, who recently completed a PhD) all they could have wanted. They were open-minded, creative and fun. This is where Feel Good diverges from reality. The TV series shows far more of the parents’ angst than their free spirits. In one standup monologue, Martin says that their mother drew diagrams for her young child to illustrate everything from the missionary position to anal sex. On stage, Martin says that on the first day of school, aged four, they told any pupil who would listen how to perform anal sex while delivering the savage blow that Father Christmas didn’t exist. Martin admits there was comedic licence there – it wasn’t quite the first day, but the essence of it was true. “I was delivering a lot of hard truths to the kids. I was just like: I can’t believe we’re all living in this charade.” Martin frequently revisits the family setup in standup routines. In one, the family is seated around the breakfast table, their father naked with his huge penis (labelled a “monstrosity” by their mother) dangling under the table. Martin’s brother, then a toddler, wanders under the table, and decides to take a bite of this fleshy delight. Martin re-enacts the unearthly scream their father emitted. How does their father feel that some fans will know of him primarily for the size of his appendage? “I don’t think he was thrilled. It mustn’t be ideal having your kids telling really personal stuff about you.” And how old exactly was your brother when he had a nibble of your father’s penis? Now, Martin looks wary and says with an uncomfortable laugh: “Look, I wasn’t there. This is a story I have heard. I think you’re looking for the scoop!” In another sketch Martin mentions that the only thing young Mae asked for at Christmas was the right to turn up at the extended family dinner naked. Well actually, Martin says, the reality was somewhat different. “I loved to be naked. I was naked a lot as a kid – it wasn’t just Christmas. That was a joke.” Now I can see why Martin is so reluctant to be asked about the truth of their comedy. Personal comedy is a retelling of reality with bells on. To literalise it is to suffocate it. Martin seems happier chatting about day-to-day stuff than trying to deconstruct the past. So an apology for having no milk leads to a conversation about coffee consumption that leads to another about dreams. Out comes their phone, so they can show me the latest in dream technology. “I talk in my sleep, and this app records everything I say,” Martin grins, and starts to play highlights. “What is the fucking point?” This is Martin last night, in angry despair while asleep. “Sorry, I’m just monologuing at you,” goes the next sleep soundbite. “It sounds like a work situation, trying to pitch something.” Why did you start doing this, I ask. “Because I often wake myself up talking or people I sleep with say: ‘You’re talking absolute shit.’” Always? “Yeah. This is so weird.” Martin scrolls to the next recording. “You know who’s killed at alarming rates? Trans women.” This time, Martin’s voice is deep and distressed. “I don’t sound like myself.” You sound like your mother in Feel Good, I say. “I do, actually, that’s true. It’s raw emotion unfiltered.”  Martin is too aware of their own anxiety to be alarmed by all this, and it’s not all horror. “There are lighthearted ones, too. This is the happiest one I’ve got.” Again, Martin scrolls forwards. “Oh boy, I’ve got a puppeee. Wheeeeeeee!” I’m sure these snippets will make it into a future standup routine. Martin says their young self was an incorrigible showoff. “I was really extroverted till I started doing comedy full-time. When I was eight I was doing shows at lunch and giving tickets out to the other students. I was doing Ace Ventura impersonations and showing people how many pushups I could do. So irritatingly extroverted. Then as soon as I started doing comedy I calmed down. Now I think I’m pretty introverted. I save all my energy for getting out on stage.” As a six-year-old, Martin became obsessed with Bette Midler after seeing her in the film Hocus Pocus. It was one of several obsessions that also included Pee-wee Herman and the Rocky Horror Show. Martin didn’t realise it at the time, but now sees it as an expression of an addictive personality. The family adored comedy, and Martin grew up surrounded by their parents’ records and videotapes – Monty Python, The Goon Show, Blackadder, Steve Martin. At the age of 11, they went to their first comedy club. “These comedians just seemed like rock stars. I couldn’t believe it. A summer camp counsellor said, ‘You should be a comedian’, and as soon as he said that I thought, ‘How do I do it?’, and signed up for some classes.” Along with two school friends, Martin went to the Toronto sketch show Family Circus Maximus 160 times in a single year. Newspaper features were written about the trio, who became known as “the Groupies”. Martin began to do their own standup, in school uniform, at 13. “I felt my whole body vibrating with excitement and euphoria. I found the adrenaline addictive, and the camaraderie and the feeling of inclusion into this club of cool people that I admired. I couldn’t believe it. It felt amazing.” You can sense their euphoria, as Martin recalls it. Inevitably it had its downside. Many of the adult comics were fuelled by alcohol and drugs. By the age of 14, Martin was boozing, taking cocaine and selling drugs. “My parents had given me a very long leash; then, when I started getting into trouble and dropping out of school, they were very alarmed.” How tough was it for them? “It was really difficult for everybody. We’re so close now, but it was a really difficult time.” Did Martin lie a lot to loved ones? “Yes, I think anybody who has done drugs ends up lying to a lot of people about the things you’re doing for drugs. Very quickly, life became hellish. Nightmarish. I really went all-in. As soon as I started having relationships with older people that I wasn’t emotionally equipped to handle, that caused huge anxiety and then ... ” Martin trails off. “I was 14-15. They were like 28-30. And it wasn’t like lots of my friends were doing drugs, it was a very solo thing. Intense and lonely.” Martin left school at 15. Their parents were distraught. At 16, Martin was full-time at the Second City comedy club in Toronto – in the box office by day to make ends meet; doing standup by night. In the end Martin’s parents threw their troublesome teen out of the home. By then Martin had developed close friendships with comics in their late 20s and early 30s. They offered the prodigy a place to stay and things went from there. Much of Feel Good is anything but. In the second series, Mae re-examines those early relationships, and sees them from a new, disturbing perspective. In one devastating scene Mae visits a former mentor and lover who admits: “You’ve outgrown me.” Mae asks him whether his intentions were always dishonourable when he provided sanctuary. It strikes Mae that rather than being a partner, he was a paedophile preying on vulnerable people. Today, Martin feels there was an inevitability about it all. “If you put a teenage girl in any industry like that, there are going to be people taking advantage. I don’t think it’s specific to comedy. It’s night-time, there’s booze and drugs around.” Did that conversation with the abuser happen in real life? Martin fidgets and umms and ahhs. “Yeah, but the character’s an amalgamation of two people. I just wanted to show the messiness and complexity of a situation where you really care about someone who’s hurt you. So often it’s shown as black and white – about outing people and people getting revenge, and then everything is peachy. But actually there are no winners and it’s also painful losing a friend.” At what point did you realise the relationship had been abusive? “It was a pretty recent revelation. It was around 2016 when everyone was talking about reframing relationships, and there was that zeitgeisty moment about assault. That made me examine relationships in a way I hadn’t understood before.” Martin’s tattoos serve as a shorthand for their remarkable life story. They consist of odd words and numbers – 416 is the Toronto phone code; “Oatmeal” was to impress an older woman Martin was besotted with at 16; “Basement” is to remind them never again to live in one; 28/05/07 is a reminder of the date Martin came across a close childhood friend by chance in Nepal, whom they had lost touch with. Martin eventually got clean at 20. Life was transformed. Martin became more confident, embarked on a five-year relationship with an “amazing woman”, moved to England, worked in call centres, dressed as a giant tooth to sell dental pamphlets, and supported non-verbal autistic children. Meanwhile, their writing improved, becoming less sketch-based, more personal. Martin got regular work in clubs, did a couple of TV specials, and then came Feel Good. Martin insists that there will not be a third series, that Feel Good has reached its natural conclusion. The show was about its two protagonists finding a way to feel good about themselves. And somehow they got there. To make another series, Martin says, would be a betrayal. “You’d have to undo all this personal growth that the characters have made.” So now Martin is writing a thriller with Hampson, preparing for a tour in autumn that may see a return to the character-based sketches of old, and relishing recent success. Comedy has defined most of Martin’s life. It was a means of escape as a child, a catalyst for chaos as a teenager, and has ultimately provided a path to redemption. After 14 years clean, how has Martin changed? “I’m less manic, more aware of my addictive behaviour. That enables me to write about it with a bit of perspective.” Does that addictive behaviour express itself in safer ways now? Martin smiles, more with relief than anything else. “Yes, I think I’m a workaholic these days.” Feel Good is on Netflix. The first series is also on All 4"
"Whether it is Munya Chawawa as the “posh MC” Unknown P on Instagram, Lou Sanders attempting rollerskating tricks on TikTok, or Alistair Green’s send-ups of arrogant politicians, conspiracy theorists and rude mums on Twitter, comedy videos are a constant cheering distraction in the infinite scroll of lockdown. While the rise of the viral comic started pre-pandemic – Mo Gilligan, now a Bafta-winner, first broke through on social media, while US comics such as Alyssa Limperis and Meg Stalter have been doing front-facing phone-camera videos for years – during lockdown, comedians who would usually be on stage were forced to find new ways to tell jokes. With more comics than ever gaining big online followings, the industry is reckoning with a big question: has Covid changed comedy for good – or is it a short-term boom? Social media certainly has the potential to democratise the business. In the UK, most comedy stars build their profile through unpaid gigs and taking loss-making shows to the Edinburgh fringe, where a huge PR budget buys a better chance of getting scouted for the coveted career leap to TV. It is an anxiety-inducing cycle that favours those with money and the ability to spend every August splurging it. As comedians realise they can pick up bigger audiences (including comedy’s gatekeepers) online, returning to non-stop live shows might feel pointless. Comedians Alasdair Beckett-King and Stevie Martin were thinking about this before the pandemic, both making videos for social media after the last Edinburgh fringe in 2019. “Edinburgh is essentially showing people that you’re still doing comedy,” Martin says. Yet she estimated 2,000 people might see her Edinburgh run, while a video could beat that in minutes. She began creating sketches with the actor Lola-Rose Maxwell about stuff that annoyed them: being asked to work for exposure rather than money, or tracking a missing parcel. During lockdown, now filming on Zoom, their views ballooned. Beckett-King had similar thoughts: “I could have a video seen by thousands, although I know the intensity with which people are watching is less.” He already had the technical expertise from a film degree, so he started remoulding old jokes from his live shows into online sketches. His videos feature flawless green-screen forests and spacecraft, animated dogs and goblins, and well-observed music, accents and costumes, helping make his film and TV parodies particularly popular. A recent parody of Scandinavian crime dramas reached 2.5m YouTube views. Its success boosted his YouTube subscribers from 600 to more than 76,500. Of course, among those viewers are comedy’s gatekeepers: the agents, commissioners and producers who can open a comic’s career up to an audience beyond the iPhone. “Social comedy is an incredible calling card for new comic talent,” says Fiona McDermott, head of comedy at Channel 4. “Chances are, when someone is pitched or suggested to us, you can look them up and some of their work will be out there. It’s democratising and exciting, and it’s a marked change from how we would have received pitches even three years ago.” Gregor Sharp, a BBC comedy commissioning editor, agrees. “People send a link and say: ‘Have you seen this person?’ in those informal, ground-level conversations. The other avenue is casting. Traditionally that would be a very formal process, but social media is starting to revolutionise that. It is a really valuable avenue now to access new talent, without them having to get on an agent’s books, network, go to events.” The upcoming BBC Three comedy series PRU, about teenagers in a pupil referral unit, was partially cast this way, with callouts on Instagram and auditions over Instagram Live helping to find new talent. “As an agent, it’s incredibly helpful to be able to put clients’ videos in front of producers and casting directors, as they serve to quickly and efficiently highlight how skilled a client is,” says United Agents’ Isaac Storm. Storm represents Harry Trevaldwyn, who grabbed Twitter’s attention back in March 2020 in character as Boris Johnson’s daughter getting grounded. He only had 200 followers then, but that has grown to nearly 17,000. Trevaldwyn is now working on writing and acting projects off the back of his social success. Similarly, the comedian Toussaint Douglass started experimenting with a green screen in his bedroom when the pandemic began, creating Star Trek and Bridgerton parodies, and workouts with his character Jaheim Wicks (“Put your hands up … like you’re being stopped by an over-zealous police officer”). Before, his comedy career was confined to the stage. Now, he has performed standup on BBC Three and joined Russell Howard’s writers’ room. “From all the opportunities I’ve got, the videos have been mentioned,” he says. Douglass made his scripted TV comedy debut on Dane Baptiste’s one-off BBC Three show Bamous: “The fact they’d seen my videos meant they felt confident I could construct a sketch using green screen technology. Back in March 2020, I just wanted to still do comedy in some form, but that made the transition from my bedroom to Bamous a lot easier.” Will social media success lead to post-pandemic rewards? For Martin and Beckett-King it looks likely – as their followers on socials increased, so did downloads of their respective podcasts. “It’s less time and more gain for me than doing a live show, but thankfully I think these online sketches will have boosted my live audience; then both sides are earning money,” says Martin. Like comedians, agents were starting to spend more time on social media pre-pandemic, and this has accelerated in the past year. Hollie Ebdon, of Ebdon Management, previously signed Alison Thea-Skott after seeing a Facebook video: “I was already aware of what a great act she was, but it put her in such a different light.” Chris Quaile, of Individual Artist Management who looks after acts like Micky Overman, says the company had “a traditional approach”, looking for talent mostly on the live circuit, but before lockdown he had begun conversations with purely online comics. “One YouTuber kept referring to what I do as ‘legacy media’,” he says. “That really aged me!” Neither has signed a comic based solely on socials – they want acts who are more than viral sensations. “The quality of what people put out and the consistency is what we look for,” says Quaile. “I don’t want to sign people purely off the back of numbers.” Although, he says, it’s now more common for networks and streaming services to want to “acquire an audience that’s been generated by that artist. They’re not going to build it with you. They want your numbers.” While Douglass has moved to TV, he credits standup as a crucial part of his journey; leaping straight from social might not be as easy. “Quick, smart sketches are perfect for the internet, but they have to have bigger ideas and bigger worlds for TV and radio,” Ebdon says. “Dapper Laughs was a great example of someone who had a big internet audience [but] maybe didn’t have enough to pad out something for telly. I hope commissioners look at what established comedians have been creating online to understand how they could transfer to TV, rather than just going after viral sensations.” The BBC’s Sharp says viral comics might slot seamlessly into simpler comedy formats, such as panel shows, but for those with script-writing ambitions it is a bit more complicated. “There’s a challenge for how new talent breaks in,” he says. “It’s that jump from something you can film yourself to something that is complex and involves more characters and storytelling.” Yet there is potential to prove those skills on social. “In shows like The Royle Family, where they don’t use a big canvas to tell the story, it’s all about pure character writing,” says Sharp. Filming at home, he adds, “forces you to dig deep into the characters for the story and that is always going to be a valuable quality in any script”. Social media has brought a lockdown boost for many comedians. As performers use more platforms to bypass comedy’s usual obstacles – location, wealth and contacts – we will see more people splitting their time between the internet and stage in future; some may stay online for good. But getting a viral hit “still involves a lot of good luck” says Beckett-King, and for those with “legacy media” dreams, while commissioners are chasing social media audiences, followers alone do not guarantee TV stardom. “The creation of a character or world that’s got real potential for something longer-form must go beyond the world of just ‘selfie framing’,” says Channel 4’s McDermott. “But there’s no doubt that this is a fertile time. I think we’ll see the rewards from the intensity and proliferation of output in the next couple of years.” The age of selfie expression is just getting started."
"The promise of a mass-vaccinated, pandemic-free future is slowly coming into view, but “despite vaccines becoming more available, there’s still one thing holding Americans back: Americans”, said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday. The Late Show host pointed to a CBS poll in which a third of Republicans said they wouldn’t get vaccinated. “Come on, Republicans! Not everything is political! How do we convince you that you want it? Would it feel safer if the vaccine was administered by an AR-15?” Many Republicans cited “distrust of government” for their hesitancy, and worried the vaccines were produced too quickly. “Duh! It was produced quickly because all of science dropped everything because your president wanted them to, and they did everything right with the clinical trials!” Colbert fumed. “You wouldn’t stand in front of your burning house and tell the fire department, ‘Hold on, there, hold on, you fellas got here suspiciously fast. And I read on Facebook that water is just milk from invisible cows.’ “One potential side-effect of the coronavirus vaccine is that people are exposed to the idea that government can get things done,” he continued. “But Senate Republicans have a way to inoculate themselves from progressive” with the filibuster, a Senate measure that allows the minority party to end bills without the support of 60 senators, rather than a simple majority. Rumors that Democrats might end the filibuster, which has gone from a rarely used tool to centerpiece of Mitch McConnell’s obstructionist strategy, upset the Senate minority leader. Addressing Congress on Tuesday, McConnell claimed the removal of the filibuster would not “open up an express lane to liberal change” but instead grind the already deadlocked Senate to a halt. “It’s already happening, you idiot!” Colbert exclaimed. “And the filibuster is why it’s happening. If you threaten to blow off my head with a shotgun, and I say ‘Let’s take away that idiot’s shotgun,’ it’s not much of a threat to say, ‘If you do, I’ll shoot you in the face five times with a crossbow.’” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah investigated Donald Trump’s refusal to promote the coronavirus vaccines he’s demanded credit for. “I can’t say that I’m surprised that Trump isn’t making an effort to get people vaccinated,” he said. “I mean, the man barely did his job when he had his job, you think he’s going to start working now, for free?” Even though he’s not interested in promoting it, he’s very interested in getting credit; last week, the former president’s team released an official statement in which he used a racist anti-Asian term to describe the virus and demanded people “remember” who was responsible for the vaccine. “Look, I get where Trump is coming from – the vaccines were a scientific miracle developed in record time on his watch. You cannot deny that,” said Noah. “But that’s what makes it so weird that he’s not out there promoting the vaccine. Like when Tom Brady won the Super Bowl, he went and held the trophy and celebrated with his team. He wasn’t like, ‘Yo, I’m gonna sneak out the back, don’t tell anybody I was here.’ “I don’t know why Trump isn’t promoting the vaccine,” Noah concluded. “Maybe he doesn’t want to help Joe Biden end the pandemic, maybe he’s still trying to unload all the hydroxychloroquine that he bought last summer.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel rifled through some outrageous Fox News outrage. First, host Tucker Carlson’s denigration of Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B’s jubilant (and heavily censored) performance of their song WAP at the Grammys on Sunday, which guest Candace Owens said indicated a “weakening of American society” and the “end of an empire”. “Right, right – deadly attack on our nation’s Capitol? Understandable. Two black women with a dirty pop song? The end of an empire,” Kimmel deadpanned. “Pretty sure they said the same thing about Madonna and George Michael in the 80s but I guess they have nothing real to complain about.” Meanwhile, Trump’s “fraudigal son” Donald Trump Jr complained about Biden on Fox News, calling his first two months in office “the most disastrous first 60 days in the history of American politics and certainly the presidency”. “Name 10 presidents,” Kimmel retorted. “Go ahead. Please, we’ll wait.”"
"When Johnny Rotten crouched on the edge of the stage in San Francisco in 1978, at the demise of the Sex Pistols’ US tour, and asked, “Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated?” it would inspire a key moment in a film four years later. In Ladies and Gentleman, the Fabulous Stains, Billy (Ray Winstone) fronts the Looters – a London punk band, all “poxy” this and “bollocks” that – rounded out by real-life Sex Pistols Paul Cook and Steve Jones, as well as Paul Simonon from the Clash. Billy addresses the fanatical teenage girl audience awaiting the set of headline act the Fabulous Stains, and snarls: “You’ve been ripped off.” Rotten’s comment had been in reference to manager Malcolm McLaren booking the disastrous tour in cities unlikely to embrace the Pistols, whereas Billy’s broadside is motivated by resentment that his booking agent has turned what had been the Looters’ support band, the Fabulous Stains, into a cynical marketing concept. “You’re adverts. You’re a commercial,” he spits at the audience of “skunks”, named after the two-tone hair of the Fabulous Stains. This sea of teenage girls is dressed in the official Stains merch of transparent red blouses, completed by red winged eye makeup, and underwear and fishnets with no skirts. It’s not the only parallel to the Pistols in this long-lost cult film, now available to rent or buy on YouTube. Jones and Cook, who wrote many songs on the soundtrack, formed the Professionals after the Pistols broke up. One of that band’s singles, Join the Professionals, winds up being the Fabulous Stains’ break-out MTV hit. The Fabulous Stains themselves, made up of nihilistic firecracker Corinne Burns (a 15-year-old Diane Lane); Jessica McNeil (13-year-old Laura Dern) and Tracy Burns (Marianne Kanter) are pitched somewhere between the Go-Gos and the Runaways, and frontwoman Corinne is frequently invited on to TV shows, thanks to her bleak one-liners that are guaranteed to shock suburbia. One moralistic TV news anchor is clearly modelled on Bill Grundy, whose 1976 interview with the Pistols descended into mayhem when he contemptuously goaded them into swearing. The plot follows a tour of the US, initially headlined by rock dinosaurs the Metal Corpses (a washed-up version of KISS), followed on the bill by the Looters and the Fabulous Stains. Each band is out of step with the next. Metal Corpses singer Lou (played by Fee Waybill of the Tubes) lectures the Looters that their leather rockabilly look is nothing new, resulting in a scuffle. Winstone threw a real punch, according to Waybill, which is perhaps not surprising, as Winstone – who was already famous for his back catalogue of playing the troubled thug, in Scum and Quadrophenia – has admitted to the Guardian that he has head-butted the odd director. The Fabulous Stains are just as disparaging of Metal Corpses (“He was an old man in a young girl’s world,” they tell reporters when the guitarist overdoses backstage), but also of the Looters, who are themselves has-beens by 1982. They’re repulsed by the way their tourmates assume all women are groupies, giving rise to the slogan, “We’re the Stains and we don’t put out”. Their star soon eclipses that of the other bands, and Corinne becomes some kind of monster herself. The screenplay was written by Nancy Dowd (who used a male pseudonym, Rob Morton, as was often her way), in consultation with Melody Maker journalist and former manager of the Clash, Caroline Coon. A 1977 New York Times article about Dowd for her earlier film, Slap Shot, which is set in the world of professional hockey, describes her as a “sweet‐faced Smith College graduate from a proper Massachusetts family”. “She is 31 years old, has a trim figure and perfect teeth”, it goes on, but Dowd regularly snips her interviewer down to size, Stains-style. In fact, one wonders what the famously prickly Dowd made of the end result of Ladies and Gentleman, the Fabulous Stains. She and director/record executive Lou Adler apparently couldn’t agree on the ending, and she walked off set after being groped by a crew member. Her feminist script rubbed up awkwardly against the lingering shots of pubescent breasts bouncing behind transparent blouses. Paramount buried the film, perhaps because of a poorly received test screening, and it languished in the vaults for decades, only being screened at the odd film festival. Those fleeting outings were enough to fire the imaginations of Courtney Love and riot grrrl bands such as Bikini Kill, but the film didn’t reach a wider audience until it was released on DVD in 2008 with a cast commentary. There are some great visual moments, such as the audience of teenage Stains clones flipping off the Looters en masse, and the dilapidated tour bus rumbling through shit towns (driven by real-life reggae artist Barry Ford as the tour manager) painted red, gold and green, with “The Looters” spray-painted over “The Metal Corpses”. And the smart-mouthed script isn’t as contrived as you might anticipate, despite having to jump a number of sharks in order to catapult the Stains to MTV stardom. The ultimate burn comes from Corinne Burns, of course. “You are so jealous of me,” she tells Billy, who’s kicked down her dressing room door to tell her she knows nothing about the industry. “I’m everything you ever wanted to be.” “A cunt,” he spits. “Exactly.”"
"Andrew Lloyd Webber is calling for wealthy individuals from the worlds of theatre, film and television to support the training of young actors from the poorest backgrounds through a far greater investment in scholarships. His plea comes on the eve of a report to be launched on Monday by his philanthropic foundation that will lay bare the lack of diversity in drama schools and how this loss inevitably leads to a disproportionate number of white actors being given lead stage and screen roles. “If the theatre community is to make a real difference, then it’s no use us all wringing our hands and saying somebody other than ourselves must do something about it,” said Lloyd Webber. “Let’s all join forces to provide scholarships to fund diversity in the theatre, now.” Five years ago, the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation (ALWF) published its first report, which investigated the absence of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in live theatre. Noting that the stage needed to reflect the nation’s diversity, it found that “representation of minority ethnic actors is as low as one student a year in some drama colleges”. Now a 2021 survey of 15 of the nation’s drama schools (pdf) has concluded that, although the ethnic, cultural and socio-economic diversity of student intake has increased from 14% in 2016 to 21.5% in the 2019/20 academic year, “there remains a long way to go [as] diversity in some student cohorts is in single percentage figures”. The 2016 report set a target of 50% of places to be funded by scholarships and bursaries, but the new research found that only three of the drama schools surveyed have since achieved this. Among key new recommendations are the need for bursaries, scholarships and other initiatives. It calls for investment by producers, including those from TV and film, “who demand diverse talent but fail to invest accordingly”. In the report’s introduction, Lloyd Webber writes: “Five years ago, my foundation commissioned a report on diversity in the theatre, or rather the lack of it, with the conclusion that theatre was ‘hideously white’. Five years on there has been change, but not nearly enough. “I asked my trustees how many theatricals had taken up the foundation’s offer to administer for free a scholarship in the name of anyone who wanted to fund one. I was flabbergasted that the answer was precisely zero.” The new report highlights the struggles faced by young people who are unable to afford the average £30,000 in tuition fees for three-year courses. Since 2011, the ALWF has awarded £22m to arts education and related causes. It funds up to 30 scholarships a year. Seventy per cent of its funded scholars are people of colour. The report also notes that “the poor representation of people of colour in academic and management positions needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency”. Idris Elba, star of Luther and The Wire, said in the report: “It is the responsibility of people who want change to force change.” Elba grew up in London’s East End and recalls a teacher pointing him towards the National Youth Music Theatre, for which he was awarded a £1,500 Prince’s Trust grant: “When I got my grant, I thought, there’s hope for me, massive hope right now, because my parents couldn’t afford to subsidise me.” He suggests that the scholarship model could be more “innovative”, with corporations partnering drama schools, for example. Sarah Miller, director of the ALWF, said that they can administer scholarships: “We know how to identify those young people most at need from the poorest backgrounds. It’s making sure the money goes to the talented students.” Asked why the film industry is not doing more, she said: “Perhaps they just have not thought about funding scholarships. If they can pledge £30,000 for three years to support three scholars, it’s three scholars more who are going to come out the other end and be part of that richness of the film industry.” She emphasised that people could contribute whatever they can afford towards scholarships, rather than needing to cover the full cost. Of the new report, she added: “What’s great is that it has shone a light on all those achievements that have happened. She added: “We’ve got some schools whose intakes are up to 50% of those from under-represented backgrounds. That’s a huge achievement. But that’s only three out of the 15 that we surveyed, so it’s not huge.” Schools that have seen particularly large increases in the number of people of colour attending their courses include the west London-based ArtsEd (up 16% to 37% of the student cohort) and Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (up 15% to 32%). Lloyd Webber, whose new musical, Cinderella, opens later this year, said: “My apologies to all those who are doing great work in making the profession we love fit for our time, but to those who can afford it and perhaps aren’t, it’s time for a little less conversation, a little more action, please.” Emmanuel Kojo received an ALWF scholarship in 2011 and graduated from ArtsEd in 2014. He went on to appear in Oklahoma! (above) and Show Boat and to be nominated twice for best supporting performance at the UK Theatre Awards. “The scholarship changed my life,” he said. “My mum was working as a cleaner and the drama school fees were more than she was earning. Without the scholarship, I wouldn’t have been able to attend; it’s allowed me to study and build a career.”"
"Do consider using skimmed milk on a flagstone floor, or fresh white bread on wallpaper, heritage experts confidently advise. But please do not follow the advice of housekeepers who used potatoes to clean oil paintings, or Worcestershire sauce to polish the silver. As some people prepare for a spring clean, English Heritage has revealed some of its best historical cleaning tips – and the worst. There is much to be learned from people who had no choice but to use what was readily available, said Amber Xavier-Rowe, head of collections conservation at English Heritage. “Although we may not recommend some of the more bizarre tips, housekeepers of the past were often spot-on with their methods, despite relatively little scientific knowledge.” A good example, she said, was milk on a non-porous stone floor, which has been officially proved after conservation teams experimented during the coronavirus lockdown on the floors of Brodsworth Hall, a Victorian country house near Doncaster. Full-fat, semi-skimmed and skimmed were all used, with the latter coming out top. “It is quite subtle but it comes up really nice and we will probably end up using it in the future,” said Xavier-Rowe. She described it as a hands-and-knees job, rubbing in and leaving it stone by stone, rather than sloshing it all over with a mop. “The other thing is it doesn’t smell or attract any mould.” Wiping dirty wallpaper with white bread is also demonstrably impressive, she said. “It does work, although it does need to be fresh white bread – stale bread would be too abrasive. I tried it with some of my sourdough and it was surprisingly effective. It’s very gentle.” Xavier-Rowe said English Heritage teams would not be adopting the method themselves. “You do get crumbs so it’s not super-practical for us, to be honest. But if you can’t get hold of the stuff we use then it’s perfectly fine. You’ve just got to vacuum your crumbs up.” Xavier-Rowe said there were many cleaning techniques from the past that were hard to recommend. Sprinkling your carpet with damp tea leaves before sweeping, for example. Another dubious method English Heritage advised against was for cleaning oil paintings: rub a freshly cut slice of potato damped in cold water over the picture, then wipe off the lather with a damp sponge, finish with lukewarm water and dry and polish with an old silk handkerchief.  Similarly, do not use salt and Worcestershire sauce to polish silver, or salt and lemon on copper pans, and do not think you can clean mould from paintings by leaving them in direct sunlight. Other cleaning tips people can use include applying a soft chamois leather to give a shine to mirrors rather than glass cleaner, and rejuvenating waxed timber floors with a mixture of beeswax and turpentine. English Heritage released a video showing some of the tips. It is fronted by its Victorian YouTube star Avis Crocombe who, played by the historical interpreter Kathy Hipperson, has become an internet sensation over the last year showing viewers how to make dishes including cucumber ice-cream and Devonshire squab pie, a mix of mutton and apples. The tips come as English Heritage conservation teams continue work on their annual top-to-bottom spring cleans at properties, set to finally reopen on 17 May. This involves everything from cleaning silver and copper, washing chandeliers to lifting and rolling carpets. “There may be no visitors but the dust never stops,” said Xavier-Rowe."
"“Australia has become a test case for the rest of the performing arts world,” the Washington Post proclaimed last month, as theatres across the country prepared to move to full capacity, while throughout most of Europe and the US they remain dark. So yeah, no pressure there, says Sydney Theatre Company’s artistic director Kip Williams, two days out from launching the company’s complete 2021 season – the largest season the STC has seen since 2017. “It’s actually quite exciting to have the rest of the world’s eyes on us,” Williams told Guardian Australia. “And to be leading the way in that regard. I’ve got many friends in various cities around the world who work in theatre, they’re having such a difficult time – we’re certainly a light at the end of the tunnel for them.” Maybe some shows will open in London’s West End in the northern spring, the New York Times surmised last month; on Broadway, autumn seems more likely. “Australia, normally a secondary market for big-brand shows developed in New York and London, has become an unexpected pandemic pioneer, a model and a test case for the global theatre industry,” the Times wrote. “Now producers on Broadway and the West End are watching the Australian rebound with envy, hope and a desire to learn what works as a kneecapped art form tries to get back on its feet.” Back in Australia, when the multi Tony Award-winning musical Hamilton opens at the Lyric Theatre later this week, it will make Sydney the only city in the world with a live production of the show that has become the Phantom of the Opera of its times. “I feel like Dorothy going to Oz,” Hamilton producer Jeffrey Seller told the Times. “Finally the whole world is in full colour again.” The STC lost almost $18m in revenue during the six months that Australian theatres were forced into lockdown due to Covid-19. The STC’s Victorian counterpart, the Melbourne Theatre Company, estimates it lost $12.5m as it endured multiple closures throughout 2020. Towards the end of 2020, both theatre companies remained leery about revealing their proposed 2021 seasons in full; the return-to-normal horizon still looked blurry, and those venues which had reopened were playing to 50% to 75% capacity under state health department guidelines. Last Tuesday MTC announced the second half of its 2021 season, which will include three new works: Cyrano, Virginia Gay’s musical take based on Cyrano de Bergerac; Sunday, a play by Anthony Weigh based on the life of Heide Museum of Modern Art founder Sunday Reed, and a comedy called Jacky by first-time playwright Declan Furber Gillick. On Sunday the STC added a further 11 productions to the six already announced, including an encore of a 2020 work that despite two season extensions was still unable to meet extraordinary audience demand. The Picture of Dorian Gray, Williams’ one-woman hi-tech show that earned Eryn Jean Norvill standing ovations late least year, will return to the Roslyn Packer Theatre in July. Another show presently earning standing ovations in Brisbane – Triple X – will arrive in Sydney in early July. Billed as the first trans romcom to hit mainstage Australia – and possibly the world – the Queensland Theatre/STC joint production features New York trans performer Glace Chase, who developed the show in collaboration with the STC’s associate director Paige Rattray. Triple X enjoyed just two previews in March last year in the Bille Brown Theatre before the pandemic turned the sunshine state’s theatres dark. Chase remained in Australia, and said on YouTube in May last year that her show would include “the best sex scene ever seen in live theatre”. In preliminary publicity material issued by the STC this week, Triple X’s “intimacy director” Nigel Poulton gets special mention. In a post #MeToo environment, the presence of intimacy coordinators, choreographers and directors in the live performing arts and film industries has become de rigueur, says Williams. “It’s become so necessary to engage them, as we move forward and create much safer practices for how we realise intimate content on our stages and on our screens,” he said. “Working with a trained intimacy director ensures that the process is safe for all participants, and that we get the best story being told on stage, as well as a consistent story.” Towards the end of the year Sydney will see another world premiere, The Dismissal: An Extremely Serious Musical Comedy. The reinterpretation of those fateful events of the 11th of the 11th, 1975 on the steps of Canberra’s parliament house will be steered by Matthew Whittet, channelling Garry McDonald’s inimitable 1970s creation Norman Gunston. The production has the full blessing of McDonald, says Williams, who travelled from his sanctuary in the Shoalhaven to sit in on several readings at the STC’s Wharf premises recently. Other highlights of the 2021 STC season include a production of the Arthur Miller classic Death of a Salesman featuring Wayne Blair – likely the first time a First Nations actor will bring the Willy Loman character to life on an Australian mainstage – and the return of an almost equally enduring homegrown classic, The 7 Stages of Grieving. First devised by Wesley Enoch and Deborah Mailman more than quarter of a century ago, the production scheduled to open in May has been updated and will feature new scenes reflecting contemporary Indigenous experience. “It’s become such an iconic Australian work, one of the great works in the Australian canon,” says Williams. “[When it was first performed] it gave an extraordinary snapshot of the seven stages of Aboriginal history [dreaming, invasion, genocide, protection, assimilation, self-determination and reconciliation] but what’s happened in the last quarter of a century? It will show what has changed but also what has not. And the path ahead.”"
"They say you should never meet your heroes, which has been just as well for literature fans who for centuries have been told they would never see an accurate likeness of William Shakespeare. Until recently, there were only two definitive portraits of the playwright widely regarded to be the greatest writer in the English language and both were thought to have been painted posthumously. Art critics have even argued that the most famous – the Cobbe portrait – was more likely to have been a painting of courtier Sir Thomas Overbury, not the Bard at all. But now it seems the mystery has been solved. A groundbreaking discovery means we finally know at least how Shakespeare wanted to be seen. The effigy above his grave in Holy Trinity church in Stratford-upon-Avon was thought to have been installed several years after his death in 1616 and, as a posthumous memorial, not an actual likeness. The 20th-century critic John Dover Wilson once characterised it as that of a “self-satisfied pork butcher”. But new research has found that the bust was in fact modelled from life by a sculptor who knew him. Prof Lena Cowen Orlin, a professor of English at Georgetown University in the US, said: “It is highly likely that Shakespeare commissioned the monument. It was done by someone who knew him and had seen him in life. We can think of it as a kind of life portrait, a design for death that gives evidence of a life of learning and literature.” Dr Paul Edmondson, the head of research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (SBT) in Stratford-upon-Avon, said: “This is truly significant. We can therefore say that is how Shakespeare wanted to be represented in our memories. This is massive. It is compelling new light on what he looked like and how he operated.” Orlin’s evidence now attributes the bust to a sculptor “other than we’ve been given to understand”, a craftsman who specialised in creating such memorial monuments from life and whose workshop was “just steps from” the Globe Theatre in London, where many of Shakespeare’s plays were first performed. The painted effigy is a half-height depiction of Shakespeare holding a quill, with a sheet of paper on a cushion in front of him. In the 17th century, a Jacobean sculptor called Gerard Johnson was identified as the artist behind it. Orlin believes that the limestone monument was in fact created by Nicholas Johnson, a tomb-maker, rather than his brother Gerard, a garden decorator. She said Nicholas Johnson also worked on another monument in Holy Trinity church dedicated to Shakespeare’s friend John Combe. “The evidence is that this man’s monument – he died in 1615 – was created by a London sculptor whose practice was to travel with the sculptures to see their installation,” Orlin said. “If this sculptor followed his usual practice, he would have been in Stratford some time in the year before Shakespeare’s death. Even if not, his workshop was round the corner from the Globe. It’s highly likely that he would then have seen Shakespeare’s face.” She argued that the painted inscription on the memorial’s plaque shows that it was done during Shakespeare’s lifetime, as a space was left for funerary data to be added after the playwright’s death. “Whoever came in to fill in the date after Shakespeare died didn’t understand that he was supposed to use a whole line to give that important information,” she said. “The fact that it’s squeezed in there so awkwardly is another bit of evidence that the rest of it would have been done during Shakespeare’s life.” Orlin concluded that this would explain why Shakespeare, unlike other eminent contemporaries, did not give directions for a memorial in his will. “It would suggest, further, that he designed or oversaw the creation of his own monument,” she said. Her research also links the effigy to monuments that were then specifically connected with Oxford. The figure is wearing an Oxford University undergraduate’s gown, and the cushion detail is found in monuments memorialising lives of distinction in its college chapels. She said the fact that he wanted to be memorialised with links to the university – despite never going to university himself – “now suggests some collegial association that we don’t know about”. She conducted part of her research at the SBT, where she is a trustee. She will reveal her findings in this year’s Shakespeare birthday lecture on 23 April, organised annually by the SBT and the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham. She will include them in a book, The Private Life of William Shakespeare, to be published by Oxford University Press in July. “Lena shows that the person we thought had sculpted the monument for years, Gerard Johnson, is not the right person and that Nicholas Johnson instead produced monuments of people while they were still alive. It’s just amazing. I think that the monument will never be the same again after Lena’s research. She’s made us look at it with fresh eyes,” Edmondson said. He described the research as “a kind of portrait”, noting that in Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale, Hermione’s statue comes to life at the end. “Lena’s bringing Shakespeare’s monument to life,” he said. “What she’s saying is groundbreaking.” Tickets for the lecture, priced at £5, are available from the SBT."
"Sebastian Stan, AKA Bucky Barnes, AKA The Winter Soldier, is attempting to characterise his relationship with his on-screen partner Anthony Mackie, AKA Sam Wilson, AKA The Falcon: “I grew up with buddy comedies like 48 Hours, Coming to America, you know, Lethal Weapon, Turner and Hooch. All those movies I grew up with. So for me, it was like I was making an 80s film with Anthony Mackie.” By this stage, Mackie is laughing his head off in a separate Zoom window: “We’re definitely the Turner and Hooch of the Marvel Universe. That’s the perfect description of who we are.” For the uninitiated, in the 1989 comedy, Turner was a detective played by Tom Hanks and Hooch was a big, unruly dog. So who’s the latter? “Oh man, I gotta rewatch that movie now,” says Stan. “He went too far with Turner and Hooch”, reckons Mackie. “I would say Starsky and Hutch.” Old superheroes never die; they just get recast. Or they miraculously survive the incident that supposedly killed them off. Or, increasingly, they come back for their own small-screen spin-off. The last two, if not the first, apply to Mackie and Stan’s double act The Falcon and The Winter Soldier. In the Marvel movies, both characters were always in the shadow of Chris Evans’s Captain America – two Hooches to his Turner. Bucky Barnes made his entrance as Cap’s wartime comrade in 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger. He supposedly died in that movie, only to return as Captain America’s brainwashed, metal-armed nemesis The Winter Soldier in 2014. Mackie’s winged war veteran Sam Wilson entered the story at that stage, and both characters soldiered through numerous Marvel campaigns (Ant-Man, Black Panther, Captain America: Civil War) before being vaporised at the end of Avengers: Infinity War. Fortunately they survived that, too. Now, in the absence of Evans, they are back for a six-part Disney+ series that seeks to continue not just their stories but the whole Marvel machine. Having held the movie world’s attention with the Avengers saga, Marvel is gambling on doing the same on the small screen. Hot on the heels of the well-received WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a doubling down, with a reported budget of $25m per episode – almost twice as expensive as The Crown. In the time-honoured buddy tradition, Mackie’s Falcon and Stan’s Winter Soldier are initially reluctant partners, to the extent they can’t even agree to call themselves partners. They settle on “co-workers”. “They’re cut from different cloth, so to speak, and have to find a way to coexist and work together,” says Stan, “and to some extent, that’s what Anthony and I have had to do for the last seven years or whatever we’ve been working together.” Stan is speaking from Vancouver. His generic Zoom background is of a tropical beach. Mackie is at his home in New Orleans, in what looks like a sports bar. If nothing else, they have learned to laugh at each other. Stan mocks Mackie for his incessant cigar-smoking on set; Mackie ribs Stan about his antisocial tendencies, and the fact that his Winter Soldier arm prop (basically a metal-effect sleeve) is “the most disgusting thing in the history of cinema”. Do they ever socialise together? “We’re never really in the same city,” says Stan. “I think that’s maybe one problem. Although Anthony did invite me to come fishing with him.” His voice cracks into a groan: “And I know that I have to do that, at some point.” “It’s a bone of contention that he won’t let me take him fishing,” Mackie admits. “I think it would be amazing for Sebastian to just sit in the wilderness and think about everything that’s going on.” Stan: “He’ll be like: ‘Keep going, don’t worry, a little further,’ and I’ll be like: “Why do I feel like he’s gonna shoot me in the back?’ Like that scene in Goodfellas.” Mackie [imitating De Niro in Goodfellas]: “Right around the corner. Right there.” Stan: “Just you and I, having an overnight fire, camping … ” Mackie: “See? That’s all I want. What’s the worst that could happen? You could get chased by a wild boar.” They continue mocking each other until both are collapsed in laughter. Ex-military types might recognise this condition as “demob-happy”. It must be a weird thing to be playing the same characters on and off for the best part of a decade, especially in the secretive world of an open-ended mega-franchise such as Marvel. Both actors have done good work in between: Stan in The Martian and I, Tonya; Mackie in Detroit and The Hate U Give. But neither felt “done” with Marvel, they say. True to their characters’ military origins, there is a feeling of being on permanent standby, always ready to be called up for another mission. “But once you get that call, it’s sort of like Christmas morning,” says Stan. Mackie agrees. “I’ve played this character for so long I know him inside and out. So to build on that with more story, more arc, more background, every time you revisit them, it becomes easier. When you go into a new character it’s much more work because you have to start from the ground up.” The exposure has also benefited his career: “There are so many people who I run into who had never seen me in anything until they saw me as Sam Wilson, and then they went back and watched other stuff.” Any doubts about returning were assuaged by the fact that this is a small-screen outing with big-screen values. As well as buddy comedy we can expect white-knuckle action sequences (the opening episode pitches Falcon into a spectacular aerial chase involving helicopters, flying suits and missiles) and new locations (a trip to the fictional south-east Asian city of Madripoor is on the cards), although where the six-part story will go remains unknown. The Captain America movies were always the “serious” backbone of the Marvel stories, reflecting current themes of military overreach, surveillance, patriotism and loyalty to the flag. In 2014’s The Winter Soldier, Captain America turned against his corrupted government and went rogue. Both Falcon and the Winter Soldier sided with him. If it’s minded to continue in that direction, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier has plenty to chew on, given the recent era of Black Lives Matter, taking the knee, Trumpism and far-right nationalism. Alongside other returning characters (Emily VanCamp’s Sharon Carter, Daniel Brühl’s villain Baron Zemo), the series introduces “US Agent”, played by Wyatt Russell. In his various incarnations in the comics, he has been both a super-patriotic nemesis to Captain America and also his successor. Also thrown into the mix are a group calling themselves “the Flag-Smashers”, whose name and comic-book heritage suggests another element relating to nationalism. “That’s another undercurrent that I love about the show,” Stan says. “It’s about deeper things than just symbols. You can’t just take symbols and justify actions by them.” Following the tragic death of Chadwick Boseman, AKA Black Panther, Mackie is now the most prominent Black character in the Marvel Universe, which also gives his story extra weight. Marvel president Kevin Feige has acknowledged as much: “What had been a classic passing of the torch from one hero to another at the end of Endgame [where Evans’s Captain America handed his shield to Mackie’s Falcon, as if anointing him as his successor] became an opening up of our potential to tell an entire story about that,” he said. “What does it really mean for somebody to step into those shoes, and not just somebody, but a Black man in the present day?” Since his debut in 1941, Captain America has been the literal poster boy for US militarism; the embodiment of (white) American values. Putting a Black man in the role is no small gesture. “The patriotism aspect is a very big part of my character,” says Mackie. “You have to remember, when you first met him he was a counsellor for soldiers trying to re-acclimate from war. And with Wyatt’s character, there’s a certain mutual admiration that comes along with both of them being ex-military. So, definitely, you can expect more of that.” As for becoming Marvel’s most prominent Black superhero, Mackie expertly deflects the question: “I never thought about the passing of Chadwick being an opportunity for Sam Wilson,” he says. “Chad and I had a lot in common, being from the south and being classically trained from the theatre. I think that’s why we grew so much as individuals, because there was an understanding. So, I would like to keep up his legacy as an individual human being and as a man, more than keeping up his legacy as Black Panther.”  There is another, less intentional way in which the ongoing Avengers saga resonates with the present moment. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is set in the aftermath of “The Blip” – Thanos’s mass extinction event, as a result of which half the population effectively disappeared for five years, then returned. “The show deals with our characters coming back after The Blip and trying to figure out what’s their new normal in this new society,” says Mackie. “And that’s exactly what we’re dealing with today with Covid.” It was a case of life imitating art. The show was written (by Malcolm Spellman, best known for hip-hop series Empire) a good 18 months ago. Shooting in Prague had been under way for six months before being shut down by local Covid restrictions last March. They had to wait until September to complete the shoot, under socially distanced, quarantined conditions. With most cinemas closed, this is a fortuitous time for superheroes to be migrating to the small screen. In the pipeline are shows centred on Tom Hiddleston’s Loki, She-Hulk and Ms Marvel, among others. Which leads to the inevitable question: is there another Avengers-style, multi-title masterplan unfolding here? Do Stan and Mackie have a sense of the bigger picture? “I don’t think we do, honestly,” says Stan.  “We know that there’s going to be a big movie with a bunch of heroes and shit blowing up,” Mackie says. If he really is the next Captain America, he’s either none the wiser or he’s using that superpower known as “acting”. Either way, he’s not letting on: “I haven’t seen the final cut of the last episode. So I don’t know if I die yet. But … I hope I don’t.” Stan: “Yeah. Hopefully we all make it.” Mackie: “Hopefully.” They’re both laughing again. “Just trying to stay alive, brother.” Stan: “That’s right. A day at a time.” Let’s wait and see. But if this is the end of the road, there’s at least potential for a reality show: Fishing With Mackie and Stan, anyone? New episodes of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier are available Fridays on Disney+"
"Sun’s out, guns out: Baz Luhrmann captures the temper-fraying, passion-sparking heat of Shakespeare’s summertime tragedy. We’re in Verona (or is that Venice?) Beach, where the boardwalk throbs and shirts are either loud or absent. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are love’s young dreamers, and – in a jostle of brilliant supporting performances – Pete Postlethwaite is a friar with a huge back tattoo. Want to see the star-crossed lovers in the “Wooden O” on London’s South Bank? Shakespeare’s Globe has filmed several versions including Brazilian company Grupo Galpão’s rumbustious visit for the 2012 Globe to Globe festival. It is told with irresistible circus skills and has an onstage role for the Bard. Kenneth MacMillan’s Royal Ballet production, set to Prokofiev’s intoxicating music, has been elegantly filmed with Carlos Acosta and Tamara Rojo (in 2007) and Federico Bonelli and Lauren Cuthbertson (2012). But you can still see the legends who first danced it in 1965: Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev’s performances were captured the year after. Halfway through the prologue, this animation rips up the script to deliver the tale of two households with warring garden gnomes. Battle lines are drawn between semi-detacheds in Stratford; the weapons are trowels and high-pressure hoses. The nurse is an ornamental frog and Gnomeo and Juliet are daredevils who race lawnmowers. Love blooms while hate rages in Erica Whyman’s 2018 Stratford production, featuring Tom Piper’s rotating cage-like cube on stage. The feast is a headbangers’ ball, the fights furious and the performances physical – you sense Bally Gill and Karen Fishwick’s frustration in their forbidden romance. When Franco Zeffirelli did Romeo and Juliet at the Old Vic in 1960, it had young stars (Judi Dench and John Stride), a vivid Italian setting and vibrant emotion. The same goes for his 1968 hit movie, which paired teenagers Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting – a younger couple than in previous screen versions. “Is she a … Capulet?” Watch Laurence Harvey’s rosy-cheeked, auburn-curled Romeo’s heart break at the masked ball in Renato Castellani’s courtly Technicolor movie from 1954. It’s the sort of Shakespeare where everyone has pastel-coloured tights and the chorus is John Gielgud in a ruff. But try and keep a dry eye when Susan Shentall’s Juliet wakes up. If Shakespeare was a genius at rhyming couplets, so is Stephen Sondheim: just listen to the staggering lyrics of America, the showstopper in West Side Story, winner of 10 Oscars. Jerome Robbins choreographs balletic battles between the Jets and the Sharks, slang-slinging gangs whose senseless feud unfolds on the streets of New York while the ill-fated lovers share trysts on a fire escape. Michael Nunn and William Trevitt of BalletBoyz took Kenneth MacMillan’s ballet out on the town in a glorious open-air version filmed in Hungary. Bright and brisk, it hurtles towards its finale and is lavishly presented with sumptuous costumes. Francesca Hayward soars in her film debut opposite William Bracewell. “Fair Verona” is a white-tiled institution in Bourne’s gut punch of a tragedy, filmed at Sadler’s Wells. Paris Fitzpatrick’s preppy Romeo is newly admitted and stripped to his undies before meeting cute with Juliet (Cordelia Braithwaite). It’s chilling, often cheeky and truly charming."
"Over two months after the siege of the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, injuring 100 officers and killing one, the House voted on Wednesday to award congressional gold medals to Capitol police who defended the building and the lawmakers inside. “It was a rare bipartisan vote to honor the men and women who protected our democracy,” explained Stephen Colbert on The Late Show. “Nobody could ever oppose that – except for the 12 Republicans who opposed that.” Colbert referred to the oppositional group – 11 white men and the QAnon follower Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – who objected to the use of the term “insurrectionists” to describe the rioters as the “legion of dumb”. “OK, you don’t like insurrectionist — how about ‘neck-beard fascist neo-Confederate tiny penis treason-humpers?’ he fumed. “These congressmen are a bunch of cowards. The mob came to kill them, and now they’re worried that calling them insurrectionists might hurt their feelings?” Colbert also addressed outrage over the shooting by a 21-year-old white man of eight people in Atlanta, including six Asian women in an attack that targeted Asian massage spas. “This horrifying act of senseless violence has once again shocked the nation,” Colbert said, although it’s not surprising given the rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans, which climbed by 150% in America’s biggest cities climbed last year; the spikes in March and April, when the coronavirus first locked down the country, coincided with Donald Trump calling the virus “kung flu” and blaming China for the pandemic. “He’s clearly just using hate as a tool to blame his own failings on a foreign country,” Colbert said. “All Americans, myself included, have an obligation to treat each other with respect and do a better job treating marginalized communities with the dignity they deserve. Our former president bears a particular responsibility for amplifying this form of hatred, just as surely as he bears responsibility for the series of events he incited on January 6th. But this January 6th that’s happening every day for Asian American people in our country because he was desperate to pass the buck. “This will always be part of his legacy,” Colbert concluded. “He will be remembered as a hateful man who left a stain not just on the White House pillows but on our whole society by inviting his Maga minions to an all-you-can-hate racist buffet.” On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed a surge of detained children at the US border. “Even though Biden ended some of Trump’s cruel immigration policies and is trying to return children who Trump separated from their families, that has not been enough to end the suffering,” he explained, as there are now a record number of children in border control custody. Pressed by ABC news about the situation, Biden urged migrants to hold on crossing the border. “Don’t come,” he said. “Don’t leave your town or city or community.” “OK, that’s worth a shot, I guess?” Noah responded. “But the phrase ‘Don’t come’ isn’t going to prevent immigration any more than it prevents a pregnancy on Bridgerton. Because Biden is still being way more welcoming than people are used to. ‘Don’t come’ is basically an engraved invitation compared to ‘You shithole countries, rapists need to pay for our wall.’” While the Trump administration forced migrant families and children to return to dangerous conditions in Mexico, the Biden administration intends to allow migrant children to stay through the asylum process. But the system is so overwhelmed that many are languishing in detention on American soil. “Please, let’s not forget to have empathy for these migrants, because who can blame parents for wanting to give their children a better life?” Noah said. “I mean, there’s just so many more opportunities for them in America,” he said. “Blue Ivy just won a Grammy – who wouldn’t want that for their child?” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel celebrated Biden’s goal to get 100 million Americans vaccinated by the end of his first 100 days in office, a deadline he beat by six weeks. “Isn’t it amazing what you can do when you don’t put Jared in charge?” he joked. “It’s a little weird to have a president who actually does what he says he’s gonna do. I don’t like it. It makes me uncomfortable,” Kimmel joked. “I feel like Biden’s doing that thing hustlers do when they pretend they’ve never played basketball before, and then as soon as the money comes out they start dunking on everyone. “The big challenge now will be: can they find another 100 million Americans who want it?” Kimmel also touched on Biden’s comments to ABC news that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was a “killer”. On Thursday, Putin responded with a “very Putin-esque” rejoinder: “I wish you health, I wish you health,” he said, delivered without warmth. “In other words, if you know what’s good for you, don’t drink the chamomile tea,” Kimmel joked."
"Fans of Seinfeld understand the perverse pleasures of spending time with the Costanza family – watching these pugnacious people bicker and yell and jump down each other’s throats, turning what might have been sedate occasions into epic shouting matches. I daresay that the Beare family in Mother and Son – particularly the titular characters, brilliantly played by Ruth Cracknell and Garry McDonald – could give George and his folks a run for their money. This great Australian sitcom is so devoted to capturing their arguments that watching it feels almost like a form of assault. Retrospectively viewed through the prism of a proto-Seinfieldian exercise in narrative minutiae, this terrifically spiky and shouty series – which ran for six seasons, between 1984 to 1994, collecting much acclaim and popularity – is in some respects more devoted to matters of inconsequence than the famous “show about nothing”. Created and written by Geoffrey Atherden, and produced and directed by Geoff Portmann, Mother and Son is more pared back than Seinfeld, with a very small cast and a huge portion of it taking place in the house where Maggie (Cracknell) and Arthur (McDonald) live. But does Arthur really live there? I recall a moment in the first episode of the fourth season, when the show’s bitterly funny sentiment is neatly articulated. A police officer, sussing out what Arthur is up to after Maggie called the cops on him (for no good reason, of course) asks this lovable, ever-pressed upon character: “You live at home with your mother, do you sir?” To which Arthur responds: “I wouldn’t call it living.” The core reason for Arthur’s non-liveable existence is indeed Maggie. She is one hell of a piece of work, which might sound a little mean – unless you’ve spent time with her. A central tension of the show concerns the question of whether, and to what extent, the ageing Maggie is being manipulative or experiencing senility. This is established from the outset, when Maggie in the first episode walks around with a bowl of milk looking for her cat, only for Arthur to inform her it is dead: “Dad backed the car over it.” Aghast, she breathlessly retorts: “Your father died years ago!” To which Arthur responds: “I know, but before he did he ran over the cat.” This tense and pointless conversation is followed by another tense and pointless conversation, with Maggie distracting Arthur by reciting Banjo Paterson’s classic poem The Man from Snowy River (“There was movement at the station …”). Her son calls her out, offering an important observation: “Every time someone wants to talk to you about something serious, you pretend to be vague.” The point is often made that Maggie really is losing her marbles, including through visual gags such as her vacuuming the front lawn (season six) and spraying deodorant on flowers (season two). But often the humour manifests in Maggie’s manipulative genius. In the first episode of the third season, for instance, she attempts to put the kibosh on a party poor old Arthur has planned, erecting a sign on the front lawn reading “PARTY CANCELLED, DEATH IN THE FAMILY”. Arthur, a journalist, is the kind of bloke people used to call a “sensitive new age guy” – who lives with his mother, does all the cooking and cleaning and is sometimes mistaken for being gay. As is often the case in real life, particularly for full-time carers, time has recast the pair’s roles: while Arthur still calls Maggie “Mum” he is now the parent figure, dealing with an irascible “child” always determined to get her way through any means possible. Occasionally – very occasionally – the gods of adversity show Arthur some mercy, but it’s always hard fought and he’s always the underdog. Unlike George Costanza, we feel for him and want him to catch a break. Sympathy certainly never comes from his older brother Robert, a selfish and egocentric dentist played in the perfect “love to hate” key by Henri Szeps; Judy Morris is also great (such a good cast!) as Robert’s caustic wife, Liz. The script pushes the actors into full throttle, straight-for-the-jugular mode, with a flow of very skilfully written dialogue that has real bite, real edge, real oomph. Underneath their rancour-filled interactions, broader points are made about the curse of family: not just how we can’t pick ’em, but how most, maybe all of us, feel forced into certain roles defined since a young age. The harsh parent; the caring younger sibling; the lefty with a social conscience; the staid conservative; etc. Are our entire lives forms of typecasting? These themes and ideas will never age. Nor will the timeless art – for want of a better word – of the squabble, the quarrel, the beef, the bicker. There’s so much arguing in Mother and Son. And, all these years later, it’s still so good."
"The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, is “the only person who wishes it was still 2020”, joked Trevor Noah on Monday’s Daily Show, as more and more high-profile Democrats called for his resignation following accusations of sexual harassment and bullying. Seven women have now publicly accused Cuomo of sexual harassment ranging from unwanted advances to alleged groping; several investigative features have outlined a toxic culture of bullying at the governor’s office. “These accusations are some serious shit,” said Noah. From bullying to a Mad Men office culture that encouraged women to wear dresses and heels, it “sounds like Cuomo basically thought of himself as a bouncer outside a nightclub”, Noah joked. “Which is convenient for him, because that might be his job in a couple months.” It’s a stunning fall from grace less than a year after the governor rose to national prominence for his commanding, televised press briefings on the pandemic that netted him an Emmy award. But the growing number of scandals engulfing his office is “getting so bad that he’s going to have to bring back his slides just to keep track of the harassment claims”, Noah joked. Several high-profile Democrats from New York, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jerry Nadler and more than 50 state lawmakers, have called for Cuomo to resign. But the pugnacious governor has so far refused to back down, blaming the calls on “cancel culture” targeting him for not being a member of the “political club”. “That’s right: from the time he became governor 10 years ago, to his years as attorney general, back to when he worked in the Clinton administration, Andrew Cuomo has never been part of the political club,” said a sarcastic Noah. “And if you disagree, you can drive your ass out of New York on the bridge they named after his governor dad.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers also tore into Cuomo, who has had “such a precipitous fall from grace that in the span of just a few months, he’s gone from winning an Emmy, writing a bestselling book and doing prop comedy with giant medical swabs on CNN like a dental hygienist at a middle school assembly to facing calls for his resignation from dozens of his fellow Democrats”. As for Cuomo dismissing calls for resignation as “cancel culture”, Meyers said: “Can we now agree that the term ‘cancel culture’ is now officially meaningless? He’s using the same line as the people who spent the last three weeks getting mad about the Muppets, Mr Potato Head and Looney Tunes. “Second, how can you say you’re not a part of the political club?” he added. “You’re the son of a former governor, you were in Bill Clinton’s cabinet, your last name is on a bridge.” Meyers understood why people latched on to Cuomo’s straightforward briefings during the height of New York’s pandemic crisis last spring. “I get why we found them reassuring. I did too!” he said. “It was a scary time and there was a leadership void and he stepped into it. “The same controlling, authoritarian tendencies Cuomo has displayed throughout his career also made him a commanding presence when everyone was desperate for one,” Meyers later continued. But “Cuomo has long been known in New York as a micro-managing bully who intimidates and coerces people to get his way, which is why he has so few friends left now as he faces a stampede of intensifying scandals”. On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert admitted to a weird, unsettling hope of a pandemic-free future … if Americans would get vaccinated. Which is an open question, as one study found that nearly 30% of Americans and half of all Republican men say they do not intend to get one of the coronavirus vaccines. “First of all, I call dibs on theirs,” said Colbert. “Second of all, why? Why, Republican men, why? Your guy is the one taking credit for the vaccine even existing! You’re insulting him by not getting jabbed. You’re going to break his … whatever is where his heart should be. “If everyone gets vaccinated, we can make it through this pandemic in just a few months,” he continued. “As long as Americans don’t do anything stupid – and we’re doomed.” The host cut to clips of packed beaches and restaurants in south Florida this past weekend. “I know what’s going on our nation’s tombstone,” Colbert lamented. “America 1776-2021, destroyed by our biggest dick.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also marveled at the study in which half of Republican men said they will not get the vaccine. “Suddenly they’re against baring their own arms,” he joked, though “in fairness, they have been fed such nonsense from their Fox & Friends. “Think about it, this is what they’ve heard: the pandemic isn’t a big deal, it will wash away, it’s no worse than the flu, but it was created by China to destroy us,” he added. “Which is it? Is Trump not getting the credit he deserves for manufacturing the vaccine? Or is this how Bill Gates controls our minds? “No wonder they’re hesitant,” he concluded. “I’d be hesitant, too, if everything I was told contradicted everything else I was told.”"
"I live a mile from the house I grew up in in Amherst, Massachusetts. Our dad was a dentist, but like a cobbler’s son has no shoes, he didn’t like to treat us because work was his own space. So my mom would make appointments to see him under a fake name. As a teenager, I was kind of a dick. I had opinions on everything. I saw Harold and Maude when I was 13. It’s a film about a kid who attends strangers’ funerals and repeatedly fakes his own suicide. I guess it’s not the normal thing for a teen to relate to, but I was never accused of being normal [laughs]. He drove a Jaguar which he had converted into a hearse. The film really spoke to me: I didn’t like the world, either, and when I turned 13 I felt I had to drop out of society. He meets a 79-year-old woman called Maude who opens his eyes to the world. Maybe I was looking for a Maude but I never found one, although this guy Charlie [Nakajima], who became the singer in my hardcore band Deep Wound, schooled me in punk rock. A few years ago I bought a giant Harold and Maude movie poster from Belgium and I have it up in the house now. I saw this in a big old rundown theatre in town at around the same age, and the music resonated. I really liked Richie Havens, the Who, Ten Years After. Later, I got into the Canned Heat footage which wasn’t in the movie originally. Amherst was a hippy town and I got sick of hippies pretty quickly – the film probably accentuated my punk thing. I cut my hair with scissors and looked awful because it wasn’t quite right all the way round. My grandma liked it, because she couldn’t see that well. She’d hated my long hair, so thought it was an improvement. I think this film is why I wasn’t into drugs, because I saw all the hippy acid casualties and it seemed really lame. The hippies in town would have thousands of Grateful Dead live tapes and they’d trade them with each other. “Oh, Winterland 71!” It was too much for me, but I was very impressed that everyone at Woodstock had Marshall [amplification] stacks. When I started Dinosaur Jr, people would give you shit for playing loud. So Marshall stacks made us louder. I thought: “Well it worked then, why can’t it work now?” This was a soap opera that ran for four decades in the States. I liked the fact that it was on every day and endless, like the longest movie ever. If you missed a few months it was easy to jump back in. It was set in a suburb and really wasn’t that interesting. One guy played his [own] evil twin brother. There wasn’t anything that would obviously appeal to me – it wasn’t about kids or anything – but I associated it with skipping school. There were very few channels and nothing else to watch so I guess it was comforting that it was on all the time. When I was 26, I got to go to the set in New York ’cos Ben Stiller’s mother was in it and he wanted me to do some music for a movie. I met Kelly Ripa [who played Hayley Vaughan] and other stars from the show. It was awesome. We had a cool record store run by an Anglophile who had records from England that no one had bought, so he had 50 copies of the Eater album [The Album, 1977]. They were the youngest punk band – the drummer was 14, so relatable to me. I might have listened to this album more than any album ever. I liked their version of the Velvet Underground’s Sweet Jane, and they covered Alice Cooper’s I’m Eighteen but renamed it Fifteen and sped it up, which I thought was pretty cool. Here, nobody knew anything about punk. These records would just show up with no context, so you’d make up your own story about them. I liked the Dead Kennedys and the Ramones but when I discovered American hardcore I could relate to that even more. They were bored teenage kids. They didn’t necessarily have any problems. They were just pissed off. A magazine had an article on the best 100 punk singles ever and I collected them all. I got into the third generation [Scottish] punk bands like the Exploited. I ran into Big John [Duncan], their guitarist, when he was Nirvana’s roadie. I was really starstruck. I was 16 or 17 and starting college. Hardcore seemed like it was over and I was looking for the next thing to listen to. I landed at the Birthday Party. Very noisy. I discovered them the way I discovered everything then, probably through the record store or reading about them in a fanzine. I liked the Bad Seed EP the most, with Mick Harvey playing drums. My room mate in college hated it ’cos I would play Deep in the Woods and he’d be like “‘The knife feels like knife …’ What the fuck does that mean?” There was someone [Nick Cave] screaming in your face. It seemed very antisocial. He thought they were horrible. I’m bummed that I never got to see them, but I saw the first Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds tour and they played Mutiny in Heaven, which is as close as I got apart from VHS tapes. When I started Dinosaur, the Birthday Party were my favourite band, but what came out of us didn’t sound anything like them. I’ve met Nick and the first few times I was pretty freaked out. Now it’s not so bad. We didn’t have the concrete skateparks they do now, but there was an indoor one and the ramps were made of fibreglass or something. One of the ramps was really cool. It had circles on and if you put a quarter in and skated, each circle would light up as you went over it. Some were so high up you were almost vertical. Only one kid could do them all. But people would skate at college and we made a ramp on my street. When skateboarding was on TV they played Ted Nugent, so you’d have to mute the music. It was difficult not to get hurt while skating, which steers me away from it now, but I still skate a bit. Nowadays, I think about ramps and the feeling of being weightless a lot for some reason. I have an Alva – a remake of my teenage skateboard – and I got Tony Alva to sign it. I can still do the daffy, which is [riding] two skateboards, doing a wheelie. I do that to impress people, cos kids don’t do that now. I haven’t really changed much since junior high. Dinosaur Jr’s new album, Sweep it Into Space, is released on 23 April on Jagjaguwar"
"It’s a feeling of pure joy. Over the last year and a half, I’ve recorded a lot of stuff in what I pretentiously call the studio at the end of the garden, but the fringe? I’ve spent a month every year for the past 21 years at the fringe. Weirdly, what I miss is the liminal time backstage with other comedians. Even if you absolutely storm a Zoom gig, with one click of a button you go from being on stage to instantly back in the hotel room. It’s very disconcerting. When the pandemic kicked in, I was in the middle of a tour of Ireland. At the end of 2019 I did I’m a Celebrity, and the show was called Reality – it was a bit of a play on that. I was going to take it to the fringe in 2020, but obviously it got parked. In the meantime, I carried on writing. So the show is now an amalgam of two years of material. Does it mention Covid? I’ll always point out an elephant in the room. I won’t necessarily discuss the trunk of the elephant for a solid hour or what shade of grey it is, but I always mention the elephant. Tell us a joke: What a summer Scotland can offer! Twenty degrees every day? Granted, it’s not a great tourism slogan … Come to Scotland, it’s room temperature!Andrew Maxwell plays the Corn Exchange, Edinburgh, 27 & 28 August When the world shut down, I was in the middle of touring a show. It was called The Ballad of Kylie Jenner’s Old Face, but we had to change the name for legal reasons to Serious Black Jumper. It was the first tour I’d ever been on and I had no idea how much I was going to enjoy it. Playing live is super important because it tells me how funny I am. Telly is a very different kettle of fish, but on stage you get an immediate reaction. I’ve really missed that back-and-forth with an audience. It’s been 10 years since I started doing live performance and with my tour I’d finally worked it all out. I’d finally stopped feeling like an imposter. Then I got locked away for a year and a half, and had to meditate and make sourdough. I’ve got some fun bits planned, including a possible three-minute contemporary dance masturbation performance piece set to classical music. I performed it for someone recently and they said it was really funny, but you’ve got to remember I have been locked inside for a year and a half … Tell us a joke: If you don’t know what a maître d’ is, it’s a waiter still doing it in his 40s.Jayde Adams plays the Pleasance Theatre, N7, 12 to 14 August, running alongside its Edinburgh programme Firstly, I want everyone to know that I’m double-vaxxed, and that I won’t spit on them. This will be the first time I’ve ever taken a show to the fringe that’s not the finished product. It’s a work in progress, so that’s kind of scary. It’s not a show about Covid or lockdown, but there might be some references, simply because I existed in the past year. The first time I went to the fringe was in 2015 as a punter. It felt like Disneyland. There are so many places in the world where people say “this is a cool vibe” and I firmly believe that the Edinburgh fringe is the only place where that vibe actually exists. It’s not in Brooklyn. It’s not in Peckham. It’s at the fringe. Over the past year I’ve been doing online comedy but it doesn’t have the magic of everyone being in the same room. That being said, there have been perks: everyone tried doing a gig from the bath, which was really fun and not something you can do on stage, obviously. Though you do have to make sure you keep your hands dry and after 20 minutes the bath starts getting cold ... I could also use props and get my flatmate in it and I could cook. I’m not going to say one was better than the other, but you could enjoy them if you just took them for what they were. Tell us a joke: Just used a BMI calculator because I missed men negging me in bars.Olga Koch plays Monkey Barrel Comedy, Edinburgh, 9 to 15 August It’s just nice to have people to talk to again, especially ones who have paid for the privilege. I think the audiences will be lapping it up, too, because they’re also excited to be out of the house. In 2019, I went to the fringe and did 60 spots, gigging six or seven times a day. I wasn’t exhausted at all. For this show I’m going to be doing some new material as well as some tried and tested stuff. I do reference lockdown a little bit, but it’s not the focus, because I think people also want some escapism. I spent my lockdown writing a memoir. It’s called Sex Bomb and it’s about how sex and dating can be a bit tricky as a Muslim in a headscarf. My editor also signed Lil’ Kim’s memoir and I’m hoping my book is going to be as sexy as hers. As ethnic women Lil’ Kim was an inspiration to me in how she embraced her sexuality. The stigma is that I’m meant to be full of shame about having a libido or wanting guys and I’ve never really had that. I hope it’ll dispel some of the dated myths that are attached to Muslim women. Tell us a joke: I get so horny I’ve actually Googled during which hours in Ramadan you can drink semen. It’s between sunset and sunrise.Sadia Azmat plays the Pleasance Theatre, N7, 10 August For me there’s a desperation to get back to your job, especially because I live in Edinburgh. I used to work in the box office at [Edinburgh promoters] the Gilded Balloon and that’s how I started in comedy. My friend was a press officer and she booked a gig for me without telling me. She told me four days before the show, saying she thought my storytelling should be on the stage. That was 21 years ago. The festival’s a really special time. I really missed it last year. If anything though, I’ve had more time to gather more stories, because my shows are always really about my experiences. I thought they’d only be interesting when you travel, but it turns out that they’re just as interesting when you stay put. I’ve tried to avoid writing about Covid, but there are ridiculous sides to it that made me laugh. Like, why did I suddenly find myself downloading apps telling me all about marine traffic? I’m downloading birdsong apps and tree apps and I’ve turned into the square guy from school that I never thought I’d be. I even bought sealant for the bathroom and I’ve been jet washing. Now I know what the heterosexual version of me would have turned out like. Tell us a joke: I was surprised to see a vegetable patch in my local library. That was a turnip for the books.Craig Hill plays the Corn Exchange, Edinburgh, 5 to 8, 13, 20 to 21 August We’re naturally anxious about every possible scenario: we feel anxious about gigging, we feel anxious about not gigging. Still, on the whole we are excited, even though we’ve heard of venues having to be shut down because the front-of-house staff have been pinged. During lockdown, we’ve been doing our podcast on Zoom, but it’s a bit difficult to do sketch comedy when you’re all in different places. Suzi Ruffell is going to be the guest on our live podcast. Every one of them is party-themed and when she was on it last time there was a “sophisticated” theme. This one is going to be the opposite. Everyone needs a chaotic time. It’ll be like at the end of a house party and the host is desperate for everyone to leave but there are those few people lingering, finishing all the alcohol and having a chat on the sofa. The chat will be fast and loose and uncensored. We answer life’s biggest questions like: “Would you have sex with a robot?” Tell us a joke: We’re high achievers. In fact, Rose’s doctor said her anxiety questionnaire score was one of the highest he’d ever seen.Rose and Cam’s Late Night Jam is at Not the Edinburgh Fringe, Above the Stag Theatre & Bar, SE1, 26 & 28 August"
"Born in Bradford in 1957, the actor and comedian Adrian Edmondson studied drama at the University of Manchester, where he met Rik Mayall. Together they became involved in the 80s alternative comedy scene and starred in sitcoms The Young Ones and Bottom, which they co-created. Edmondson has since appeared on TV shows such as Jonathan Creek, Holby City, Celebrity MasterChef and EastEnders. He is also a musician and has performed in folk punk band the Bad Shepherds and with the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. He will be appearing in Once Upon a Time in Nazi Occupied Tunisia at the Almeida theatre, London, from 21 August to 18 September. Cat Stevens - Catch Bull at Four At the beginning of the first lockdown my creativity completely deserted me and I found myself listening to this album on a loop. I liked it a lot as a teenager, but I love it even more now; it suddenly resonated again with the world I was living in, especially the track 18th Avenue (Kansas City Nightmare). It’s full of nervous energy and an anxiety that can’t be satisfied, which is exactly how I felt as I sat in front of my computer looking at the blank, reproachful page, listening to him sing: “My hands were tied, as I struggled inside, the empty waste of another day.” It’s more comforting than it sounds, like singing the blues to get rid of the blues. How to Invent a Country My father taught history and geography, and this podcast (originally a radio programme) hosted by Misha Glenny satisfies both inherited itches. Being an island, our borders have been the same more or less since the Vikings left. Continental Europe has had a very different experience, with most countries seeing their territory and alliances ebb and flow: Italy didn’t emerge as a recognisable single state until 1861, Germany only in 1871. And the episode about Bangladesh, in which guest presenter Qasá Alom describes his community’s reluctance to remember the 1971 war and genocide, is a real eye-opener. Drums My midlife crisis (long past) involved buying not one, but two drum kits. Not being able to get to the pub these past few months, I finally got the electric one out of the loft and started hitting it. I’ve become obsessed with the track Roadrunner by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers, and a drum kit labelled Birch. It sounds exactly like the kit on the Jonathan Richman record and as I’m basically indulging in drum karaoke, the authenticity is an instant winner. To the untrained ear, it may sound like there is only a single continuous pattern, but in fact there are 26 and getting them all right feels like scoring a penalty at Wembley (probably!). Jane Eyre read by Thandiwe Newton Another project during lockdown involved filling in some gaps in my reading while I tootled about in the garden trying to grow vegetables in the face of the looming apocalypse. I listened to Wilkie Collins, Thomas Hardy, Henry James and George Eliot, but this beat them all. Of course I thought I knew the story from the various screen adaptations I’d seen, and was prepared for a rather put-upon woman being cruelly treated by fate, but this reading blew that notion out of the water. It’s electric: Thandiwe Newton makes Jane so strong, independent and righteously angry. So modern! And when it was revealed that the Rivers were actually her cousins – I audibly gasped. Derry Girls Just the funniest show on television at the moment. A bunch of schoolgirls living with the stupid dreams and glum realities of schoolgirl lives, but set against the real world of sectarian Northern Ireland – there are moments that feel gloriously dangerous. All the performances are brilliant – the dopey girl, the naughty girl, the organised girl, the confused girl, the girl who’s actually an English boy, but a particular delight is Siobhán McSweeney playing the most hilarious, eye-rolling nun I’ve ever seen. It’s full of actual gags! Can’t wait for series three, which I believe is round the corner. I came to it late and binge-watched both series. I haven’t laughed as much in years. “Catch yourself on!” Piet Mondrian @artistmondrian I follow several art feeds, but this is the one I find most rewarding. It opened my eyes to the period when Mondrian’s early figurative style became more and more abstract, before he produced the completely geometric pictures he’s best known for. This middle phase is full of wonder and should be celebrated more. It’s sort of half-impressionist, half-fauvist: brightly coloured representations of real things that lean towards the otherwordly. Two series in particular, one on a windmill, the other on a tree, fill me with joy. I can’t afford the original so I’ve bought a high-quality print of Evening: Red Tree."
"Television continues to eat itself in new and more meta ways. Gogglebox makes stars of the “everyday Australians” who are filmed reacting to TV every week – reaching peak navel-gaze in 2019 when Channel 10 plucked Angie Kent off the sofa and cast her as The Bachelorette. On YouTube you can watch Whitney Port, who was cast as Lauren Conrad’s work friend on mid-2000s docudrama The Hills, react to every episode of the show with her husband, who was a producer on Port’s spin-off, The City. The galaxy of reality TV recap podcasts seems to add new stars each week and, catching on to their power and popularity, Bravo’s chat show Watch What Happens Live regularly invites Bravo podcasters on to serve as guest commentators on Bravo drama. It’s an ouroboros of one liners, shady remarks, genuinely insightful commentary and behind-the-scenes gossip. It’s also completely, inexplicably gripping to watch people watch TV, regardless of how much you actually enjoy the show at the centre of the circle. In his mini-series For Real: The Story of Reality TV, streaming in Australia on Hayu, Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen attempts to do more than just recap and react, instead casting himself as a kind of reality television sociologist. For those uninitiated, Cohen is ostensibly the face of Bravo, the US cable network responsible for some of the world’s most successful reality franchises. He’s been at the network for almost two decades, serving as its vice president of original programming and more recently executive vice president of development and talent. In other words, it’s Andy Cohen I have to thank for the Real Housewives franchise and its spin-offs like Vanderpump Rules and Summer House; in other words, he is the source of the only true moments of joy I’ve experienced since February 2020. For Real is designed to tap into the pleasure centres of those who didn’t need that previous paragraph explaining who Andy Cohen is – and, crucially, those who did. It casts its net wide, and catches us up on not just the history of reality TV, but the contexts that its sub-genres, trends and specific shows existed within. Cohen asks what the world of makeover shows (remember The Swan?) did to beauty trends and the self-esteem of both viewers and contestants; paints the landscape of competition shows (Top Chef, Survivor, America’s Next Top Model); and looks at the real-life romantic potential of dating shows like The Bachelor and 90 Day Fiancé. Cohen’s essay-like approach on For Real captures interviews in person and virtually (the show was entirely produced during the pandemic), with guests including Kim Kardashian West (Keeping up With the Kardashians is classified under the banner of “celeb-reality”, along with shows like Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey’s Newlyweds and The Anna Nicole Show). Kardashian West mentions how pivotal the inaugural season of The Real World was for her desire to be seen, be photographed, be a reality TV star. When the original cast of The Real World reunites in Cohen’s studio, he sheds a tear, demonstrating that the kinship viewers felt with Norman, Julie, Heather and Eric extended well beyond the bedrooms of Calabasas teens in the 90s who went on to define the genre – and all of celebrity. Cohen brings plenty of heart to his hosting duties. He is, at his core, a fan just like the rest of us – but occasionally that infatuation with the genre and its stars makes his analysis of its effects a little shallow. It has to be: For Real aired on E!, the network that was home to KUWTK for 14 years and 20 seasons, and which broadcast the Anna Nicole Smith Show. His investigation into what reality TV does to the people at its centre can only dig so deep. But For Real digs in in other ways. The real world is always looming at the edges of constructed “reality”, and in one episode Cohen invites a panel of black women behind these shows to speak about their experiences in the genre. It emphasises how inextricable the contributions of black women and black producers are and always have been to the success of reality TV. The actor Vivica A. Fox appears on that panel, and talks about being cast on Celebrity Apprentice in 2015. If youthink that reality TV doesn’t matter, remember: the host of that show became the president of the United States the following year. Dedicating a few hours to For Real in an effort to understand the environment that got him there isn’t an insignificant mission, for Cohen or for us."
"A stoush has erupted between the publisher of celebrity chef Jock Zonfrillo’s memoir, Simon & Schuster, and Nine, the publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. A widely circulated cover story published in Good Weekend magazine on Saturday suggested there were contradictions between Zonfrillo’s recollections of his time spent with celebrated British chef Marco Pierre White in London in the 1990s and those of White. Zonfrillo, who became a household name in 2019 when he joined the judging panel of Network Ten’s MasterChef Australia, writes in his memoir, Last Shot, that White helped him find accommodation in 1994 when he was a homeless employee at White’s restaurant at the Hyde Park Hotel. Zonfrillo also writes in his memoir that White was aware of his heroin addiction at the time. Interviewed by Good Weekend, White said he does not remember several of the incidents recounted by Zonfrillo and disputed others, claiming “I never saw much of [Zonfrillo]”. In a statement sent to Guardian Australia late on Monday, Simon & Schuster said Zonfrillo stood by his story. “This is the story of my life. I’ve lived every minute of it, the highs and lows, and I stand by it,” he said. “There’s no question that some of my book makes me look pretty unsavoury at the best of times. “I carry the shame from those years, not pride, and it was a big obstacle for me to overcome when writing this book.” On Tuesday, Simon & Schuster’s managing director Dan Ruffino, quoted in Nine media, said the publisher would consider taking legal action against Nine “if we feel our sales prospects have been harmed by this article”. In its statement to Guardian Australia, Simon & Schuster said it stood by Zonfrillo’s book “as the personal recollections of one of Australia’s pre-eminent chefs”. “We take issue with a number of statements mentioned in the article,” the statement said. “There are factual errors in the piece which we are collating and will be sending to the [Good Weekend] editor Katrina Strickland.” Strickland told Guardian Australia she was confident of her publication’s fact checking processes. “Tim Elliott is a highly respected feature writer,” she said. “Good Weekend stands by Tim and the story.” The Simon & Schuster statement went on to say that Zonfrillo’s story of his time with White had been published in White’s own memoir. “Marco Pierre White’s first meeting with Zonfrillo, helping him find accommodation when he was homeless and being aware of his drug addiction are all recounted by Zonfrillo and published in Marco Pierre White’s own memoir,” the statement said. Guardian Australia has seen an image of the excerpt from the 25th anniversary of White’s 1990 cookbook/autobiography, White Heat, which was published in 2015. In it, the White/Zonfrillo relationship is told via a third party contributor to the edition, the British food writer James Steen. “Marco gave me a job and arranged for me to get accommodation when he found out I was sleeping in the changing room because I had no money,” Zonfrillo is quoted by Steen in the updated edition, published in 2015. “For a period I was addicted to heroin. Marco knew it but it wasn’t discussed. Though he was like a father to me he didn’t make me feel like a leper.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from White through his website and from Steen via his literary agent Marsh Agency. Strickland said Zonfrillo’s comments to Steen did not contradict what White said on the record in the Good Weekend piece. “One is Zonfrillo’s recollections of events – which have also been recounted in his own book and in the GW story. The other is White’s,” she said. Simon & Schuster, via Zonfrillo’s publicist Brendan Fredericks, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday: “We have no further comment at this time.”"
"“It was the scariest day of my life,” says Amin Mohamed, AKA Chunkz, of the day in 2016 that he told his parents he was dropping out of university to focus on his YouTube channel. “I remember waking up for a lecture during the first few weeks of university, and I genuinely stared at my ceiling for 45 minutes, near tears, just thinking: I can’t do this. I had this pressure [weighing on me] that my parents wouldn’t accept me leaving.” Chunkz is a first generation British Somali (his parents moved here from Somaliland in the late 80s). For me, also a first generation British Somali, he is, as a genuine celebrity from our community, a unique figure – and a local hero. Following in the steps of his three sisters, who had all graduated from university, he was studying financial maths at London Metropolitan University. For Somali kids, it’s not uncommon to have your parents push you toward a “reliable” career. So he stuttered his way through that moment, telling his parents about dropping out of university. His dad avoided eye contact and his mother became really upset. “As I was talking to them, I was doing damage control,” he says. Chunkz is also a social media phenomenon. His YouTube channel has more than 1.8 million subscribers. His Instagram, 2.3 million. His videos – a mix of pranks, challenges, sports commentary and quizzes – regularly top 1m hits. The content Chunkz puts out feels natural and honest, unlike that of so many of the more polished, wealthy, big-name YouTubers. His warm and charismatic personality makes him feel like someone you really could be friends with. Chatting to him on Zoom, it’s easy to see why he has such a massive, loyal fanbase. Chunkz has had the kind of dream YouTube career that so many kids fantasise about. He started out filming videos in 2015 in his family home with his cousin and fellow YouTuber Darkest Man. Series such as Cooking with Chunkz, where he would teach his friends how to make laughably basic meals, first got him noticed, and his appearance in Big Shaq’s 2017 viral spoof music video Man’s Not Hot (more than 390m views) made him even more popular. A music contract followed, and in 2018 he won the International Somali award for best entertainer, followed by a Mobo in 2020, the same year he co-presented the awards ceremony with Maya Jama. His growing profile won him a place at last year’s Soccer Aid match at Old Trafford, where Chunkz missed a crucial penalty (he jokingly refers to this as the worst day of his life) – another viral moment, which in turn has led to a permanent gig presenting Sky’s weekend football entertainment show Saturday Social. Born and raised in north-west London, the youngest of five (he also has a brother), Chunkz says both his parents played an active role in steering him away from the problems that could come the way of young boys growing up in a council estate in Brent. “I was blessed to have both Hooyo [Mum] and Aabo [Dad].” he says. “By the time we were between 12 and 15, a lot of the kids I grew up with either went to the right or the left.” Early on in his career, Chunkz noticed that there weren’t many YouTubers like him. He says he looked up to KSI, Poet and David Vujanic, but didn’t feel represented. “I couldn’t really relate to anyone else, so I paved the way for myself. I liked the content of the YouTubers I watched, I thought they were funny, but I couldn’t really see myself in them.” Although he says he avoided speaking Somali in his earlier videos, in case he was typecast and limited his audience, he felt he could connect with an entire community who were not being represented online. “I love being Somali,” he says. His descriptions of his childhood are familiar: the sweet chaos that comes with growing up with plenty of cousins; the loud iftars and sleepy suhoors (early morning meals) during Ramadan. And playing outside as late as you could get away with: “Everyone’s mum had to come round the corner and scream our names. I’d run inside to eat qado [lunch] and go straight back out.” As for many young British Somalis, though, myself included, a sense of pride in our culture and heritage wasn’t always easy to find. Despite my own school having a diverse student body, anti-Somali rhetoric was rife – something Chunkz says he also experienced during his school years: “To some people, being Somali was an L [loss].” The only time you’d hear about Somalis in the media was in relation to famine, refugees, pirates or al-Shabaab militants. As with many Somalis in this country, their parents fled to the UK as a result of the Somali civil war in the early 90s. Growing up, there were barely any high-profile Somalis in the news, certainly not many in the UK. We weren’t represented in culture, or in positions of power. Today, Somalis who are part of the global diaspora are making their presence known. From politics to film-making and fashion, young Somalis can look up to Mo Farah, poet Warsan Shire, boxer Ramla Ali former mayor of Sheffield Magid Magid and award-winning Rocks actor Kosar Ali.But the British Somali community is still underrepresented and often misrepresented. Disproportionately affected by Covid-19 and police misconduct, the past year has been particularly challenging. Last summer, at the height of the global protests after the murder of George Floyd, the case of 12-year-old Somali schoolgirl Shukri Abdi, found dead in the River Irwell in Bury, Greater Manchester, in 2019, was taken up by campaigners after her mother said police had failed to adequately investigate claims that she was a victim of bullying. Somalis across the UK, US and Canada organised protests and demonstrations demanding an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death. In a message posted on Instagram, Chunkz encouraged his followers to contact their local MPs to demand answers in Abdi’s case and spoke at a demonstration in London. As he watched theAbdi case unfold, Chunkz says, there was no way he could not get involved. “When I first started, the number one rule I was given by another YouTuber was: don’t get involved in politics. I was told to make people laugh and then get offline. But as I grew in this industry, I felt that responsibility fell into my lap. Not only am I Black, not only am I young, but I am also a Muslim man. I’m now seen as a role model, I have to think about everything I do and it can be difficult to balance all of that.” Since 2019, Chunkz has been living into a £5m house with four other black British male YouTubers, all friends of his, known as the Beta Squad. The group film content together and have spent most of the pandemic together. YouTubers who create group concepts often feel forced, but for Beta Squad it’s different. “We are all like brothers who all happen to be YouTubers,” he says. On camera it’s very easy to see their chemistry, comfort and banter around each other – you can tell they are genuine friends. But like the rest of us, Chunkz has had to come to terms with hard lockdown truths. “The cooking has been dreadful,” he says. We discuss the pitfalls of fame and success, but Chunkz says he feels confident he can stay grounded. He puts this down to his family, who still see him as “little Amin”, the youngest in the house, and his faith, which keeps him level-headed. “When I go to a shoot or I’m filming, as soon as people hear the adhan [Islamic call to prayer] from my phone, they all know what it is. I’ll get up wherever I am and go pray,” he says. In a recent video posted to his YouTube Channel, Chunkz announced to the world that he would be quitting music. Speaking to fellow Beta Squad member and YouTuber Sharky, he shared that he feels performing music is incompatible with his religious beliefs. “I have to stop for the sake of God,” he says in the video. The announcement immediately trended on Twitter and the reaction was overwhelmingly positive. As we reflect on this, Chunkz says it was a nice surprise. “It was not what I expected, but it was the best reaction I could have asked for.”Today, he tells me, he measures success in terms of being able to take care of his family. “I remember when my mum’s dishwasher broke, and just being able to be like, ‘‘Don’t worry, I’ve got it” – it’s a big thing for me. To know that my parents can rely on me.” he says. Chunkz wants you to know he’s thankful. It’s why he repeats “alhamdulillah” (praise be to God) more times than I can count during our conversation. I ask about his future plans. “I just want to be happy,” he says. He hopes to make more TV and move into film. “The sky’s the limit for me.” As the lights begin to dim and Maghrib, the penultimate Islamic prayer of the day fast approaches, we wrap up the call."
"In the middle of lockdown, living alone and missing the family my friends and I have made together, I started tearing up when Cory Matthews, the everyboy-to-man at the centre of the Boy Meets World extended universe, shared what he believes is the secret of life: “People change people.” That is, we need each other. We make each other better. Like a warm blanket, it’s easy to be lulled into warm and fuzzies by both the original show for kids and teens by Michael Jacobs and April Kelly that ran from 1993 to 2000, and the flashier reboot Girl Meets World produced by Disney from 2014 to 2017, also by Jacobs and Kelly, that shifts focus from Cory (Ben Savage) and the whip-smart love interest he fell for at the age of two, Topanga (Danielle Fishel), to their daughter, Riley (Rowan Blanchard). Both are streaming on Disney Plus. In Boy Meets World, Cory faces all manner of shenanigans as he ticks off life’s milestones like starting high school, learning to drive, and getting married. While he has his faults – occasional fits of ego and pride, especially – he always comes back to the belief that we are transformed by loving others. Maybe that’s because he had a good teacher. Mr. Feeny (William Daniels) improbably –and wonderfully – teaches Cory and his friends every single year from middle school to college. In the finale of the Boy Meets World he offers one last piece of advice: “Believe in yourselves. Dream. Try. Do good.” In Girl Meets World, those very words are printed above the blackboard in a New York classroom. The teacher? Cory. But the best legacy Cory gives his daughter’s show is the importance of friends. Boy Meets World is nothing without Shawn Hunter (90s dreamboat Rider Strong, all curtain hair and angst). He and Savage have great chemistry. They do the stuff of regular teenagers – they try to impress each other; they get drunk while underage; one of them joins a cult – but they do it while making you care. For an old show, it sticks the landing on several of its Very Special Episodes. It’s like a hangout sitcom for your inner child. Girl Meets World is, on balance, more earnest. The formula of slightly-naïve kid and troubled youngster repeats itself in Riley and her best friend Maya (Sabrina ‘that blonde girl’ Carpenter). This is a slighter show that doesn’t quite know how to age with its characters, and with less than half the series run of the original, it can’t provide that same depth. It helps that Carpenter, like Strong before her, grounds all that wide-eyed optimism with wry affection and a lived-in sadness that, slowly, gives way to hope. The show’s real power, though, is in its positioning of Riley and Maya’s friendship as sacred. (It’s also, for my money, the most nakedly romantic relationship in the universe – move over, Cory and Topanga!) Over time, the show expands that view and uses it to posit that all caring human connections are life’s secret superpower. For its three seasons, Girl Meets World is preoccupied with stories about how friends get and stay together, how people can know each other meaningfully and better. There is a great emphasis on helping others and letting others help you. It even allows its stock-standard punchline nerd to grow into a well-rounded character. There are still hijinks, but this is a show that proudly feels its feelings. Streaming both shows in order and in close succession is a particular pleasure. With that same core team at the helm, it takes its continuity seriously. There are plenty of easter eggs that honour the series’ history, plus a staggering amount of actors from the first series appear in the new one, including, in a fourth-wall-breaking moment, both of the actors who played Cory’s younger sister Morgan. Decades-old storylines find new resolutions. You watch everyone grow up. It’s comforting to remember the process never stops. It’s a lonely time, and sometimes you just need to feel earnestly warm about our capacity to care for others, to feel closer to your friends even while apart. This franchise more than delivers."
"Stephen Colbert kicked off Thursday’s Late Show with a little media inside baseball: the New York Times launched “18+ subscriber-only newsletters”, according to a tweet by media insider Mat Yurow. “That’s right, y’all, adults-only content for 18 and over,” Colbert joked. “It’s the New York Times … after dark. They’re slightly changing their masthead: ‘All the nudes that’s fit to print.’” Yurow subsequently deleted his tweet, and added: “To be clear, I got lazy and should have said ‘at least 18 newsletters.’ NYT is not getting into porn.” “But if the New York Times isn’t your thing, you’ve still got the Washington Post,” said Colbert. “After all, their slogan is ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness, but Bangs with the Lights On.’” Meanwhile, “when it comes to Covid, the news should be R-rated for ‘Are we ever going to get out of this?’” Colbert continued, as coronavirus case numbers rise dramatically in the south, a region with some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. “You can read all about it in the classic southern novel To Kill a Mockingbird by Giving It Medical Advice from Facebook,” Colbert quipped. Florida alone accounts for nearly one in five US Covid cases, but the surge “doesn’t seem to concern” Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, said Colbert. After Joe Biden said those who refused to fight the coronavirus with preventive measures should “get out of the way” of those who would, DeSantis said: “I am in the way to block too much interference from the federal government.” Asked for comment, the US president replied: “Governor who?” “Ha ha ha, but come on, Mr President, show some respect – he should be addressed by his full title: Governor who doesn’t care if his voters live or die,” joked Colbert. Florida has requested hundreds of ventilators from the federal government’s national supply, which “must have been an awkward call”, said Colbert, considering that last week, DeSantis told Biden via reporters: “I don’t want to hear a blip about Covid from you.” “Well, Governor, looks like it’s your turn to eat blip,” Colbert retorted. “The lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 election is the central animating belief of Republican politics today,” said Seth Meyers on Thursday’s Late Night, “which is why GOP state legislatures in states like Georgia and Texas have been racing to pass voter suppression laws despite zero evidence of any widespread fraud.” Georgia’s SB 202, passed by Republicans in March, enacted significant hurdles for voting in the state: it requires voters to submit ID information with both an absentee ballot request and the ballot itself, limits the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, allows for unlimited challenges to a voter’s qualifications, cuts the runoff election period from nine to four weeks, and shortens the amount of time voters have to request an absentee ballot. The law also allows the state election board, which is dominated by Republicans, to seize control of county boards, allowing them to disqualify voters, move polling precincts, and potentially refuse to certify the results. “Remember how Trump called the Georgia secretary of state and tried to badger him into magically finding enough votes to change the outcome? Well, basically Republicans in Georgia made it easier for him to succeed next time,” Meyers explained. “That’s where we’re at right now. Republicans saw a guy possibly commit a crime and decided to make it easier for him to pull it off. “It’s like if there was a rash of car break-ins in your neighborhood, and the town council responded by outlawing the club,” he added. In other legal news, a federal judge appointed by Trump ruled that three defamation lawsuits against “three Trump-adjacent crazy people” – Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and the MyPillow CEO, Mike Lindell – can go forward. Dominion Voting Systems is seeking billions of dollars in damages for their false accusations of election fraud. “OK, there are only two plausible explanations for what happened here,” Meyers said. “Either a federal judge appointed by President Trump ruled that unfounded claims of election fraud made by three Trump allies were not exempt from defamation laws. “Or … Hugo Chavez teamed up with China and the CIA to use Italian military satellites to hack the judges’ computer and alter his opinion, which was then printed out on paper, smuggled in from China, and covered in bamboo fibers,” he joked, referencing some of the Trump allies’ more deranged conspiracy theories."
"Stephen Colbert celebrated the resignation of the New York governor Andrew, Cuomo, on Tuesday amid a ballooning sexual harassment scandal, a stunning end to a precipitous fall in public and political favor. “Don’t let that door hit you on the butt on the way out,” Colbert quipped, “but if it does, that door should also resign.” Cuomo will still be governor for 14 days “for reasons that I do not understand”, Colbert added. “Evidently, he gave himself two weeks’ notice.” Cuomo’s resignation comes a week after New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, presented a 165-page report outlining allegations of sexual harassment and groping by 11 women. In the press conference announcing his resignation, Cuomo stopped short of contrition or humility. “In my mind, I’ve never crossed the line with anyone,” he said. “But I didn’t realized the extent to which the line has been redrawn.” “I don’t know exactly what line he’s talking about,” Colbert joked in response, “but hopefully he’ll explain it in his new book Andrew and the Purple Crayon.” In less terrestrial news, the billionaire Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, announced plans to put billboards in space. “No, Elon, no!” Colbert responded. “Mankind gazes up to the stars to wonder ‘What’s up there? What’s my place in the universe?’ Not, ‘What would you do for a Klondike bar?’” The ads won’t be that giant; according to a report from Business Insider, the Canadian start-up Geometric Energy Corporation plans to place advertisements on SpaceX rockets next year, which will be filmed via selfie stick and livestreamed to platforms like Youtube. “Oh good, using the pinnacle of human ingenuity and engineering to make more of everyone’s favorite part of YouTube: the ads,” said Colbert. Finally, American “Flavortown” connoisseur Guy Fieri unveiled a new culinary triumph. Or, to quote a Fox News headline: “Guy Fieri invents Apple Pie Hot Dog with Chevrolet for MLB’s Field of Dreams game.” “And we’ve officially found it: the most American sentence ever written,” said Colbert. “Sorry, ‘we the people’, this is our constitution now.” “During his remarks, [Cuomo] said it was best that he step aside,” said Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show, “and then every woman in the room took two steps aside.” Cuomo will be succeeded by the lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, who will be New York’s first female governor when he steps down in 14 days. “I’m sorry, but is this really a two weeks notice type of situation?” Fallon wondered. “It’s gonna be tough for Cuomo – with a track record like this, his only future is president or supreme court justice,” he deadpanned. Meanwhile, the Senate passed Biden’s $1.2tn infrastructure bill on Tuesday in a major victory for the administration. “That’s right, a trillion dollars to fix our roads, bridges and airports,” said Fallon, “so after they finish LaGuardia, that’ll leave us with about 40 bucks.” And in Florida, where the number of Covid cases are surging once again, the governor, Ron DeSantis, has threatened to withhold pay from any school officials who require masks indoors. “I’m nervous about DeSantis,” Fallon said, “I mean, right now, people in Florida are like, ‘When can Cuomo start?’” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also discussed Cuomo’s resignation with friend and fellow comic Amy Poehler. “This is frankly amazing: he made the announcement via book,” Meyers joked. “That’s right, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced today that he will resign amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment,” he continued, “so tune into CNN tonight for, I don’t know, a rerun of the History of the Sitcom?” Poehler joined Meyers to weigh in on the appropriateness of physical gestures Cuomo listed in his defense. His claim that he regularly greets people by gripping their arm? “I don’t like the word grip,” said Poehler. Pat on the face? “I don’t like the word pat either.” Slap on the back? “Well, I have a more positive connotation to that because it feels Irish to me,” Poehler said. “Although we’ve all had experiences where we’ve gotten the like angry slap on the back from somebody who’s like, ‘Good job, buddy.’” As for the one that Cuomo buried in the middle of the list, touch on the belly, “oh, that’s gonna be a no from me,” said Poehler."
"On Wednesday evening, Seth Meyers addressed the resignation of New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo – a shocking reversal of political fortune from pandemic hero to disgrace. In a press conference announcing his resignation, Cuomo continued to deny that he touched anyone inappropriately, in stark contrast to the 165-page report by the state attorney general’s office that found the governor sexually harassed or groped 11 women. “In my mind, I’ve never crossed the line with anyone,” Cuomo said. “But I didn’t realized the extent to which the line has been redrawn.” “First of all, that’s such a ridiculous excuse,” said Meyers. “You’re telling us you didn’t know that what you were doing was wrong? “You don’t get to blame the line for moving when you’re the one who crossed it,” the Late Night host continued. “Although, if you live in New York, you’ve probably heard that before. Cuomo sounds like he’s trying to talk a traffic cop out of giving him a ticket for parking in a fire lane – ‘I swear, when I parked the line was over there, and now you’re telling me it’s over here!’ “Obviously, this is not how Andrew Cuomo planned to end his career,” Meyers added. “He was once the most dominant, ruthless, most machiavellian force in New York politics. Now he’s just the latest in a long line of disgraced New York politicians who will inevitably get photographed by the New York Post with a long scruffy beard in a Mets hat sloppily eating a dollar slice on a bench in Central Park by himself.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert applauded the Senate’s passage of Biden’s $1.2tn infrastructure bill. “To put that into perspective,” he explained, “if you took 1.2tn one dollar bills and laid them end to end, they’d make better roads than what we’re driving on right now.” Nineteen Republicans joined all Senate Democrats in favor of the measure. “The last time that many Republicans crossed the aisle in Congress, it was to steal Nancy Pelosi’s podium,” Colbert joked. Even the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, voted for the legislation, which made sense, said Colbert, since “trolls love bridges”. Still, the passage of funding for bridges, roads and rail travel “isn’t some huge achievement”, said Colbert. “It’s the bare minimum we expect! Senates always pass the road bill – infrastructure spending is a great American tradition that goes all the way back to when Washington paved the Delaware.” The measure includes funding to eliminate Amtrak’s maintenance backlog and modernize the north-east corridor line “so north-east commuters will have beautiful new seats for Rangers fans to puke on”, Colbert quipped, as well as provisions for electric school buses. “And to make it even more environmentally friendly, the bullies will shoot spitballs at you with paper straws,” said Colbert, “and the wedgies will be gluten-free.” The Senate also approved a $3.5tn budget plan that would expand healthcare, provide free preschool and community college, and fund climate change programs. The measure was approved after a rapid-fire series of votes called a “vote-a-rama” that lasted more than 14 hours; some Senators even brought extra padding for their chairs to make the time more comfortable. “The chairs were padded with only the softest material – cotton, goose down, Ted Cruz’s spine,” joked Colbert. And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon discussed Biden’s $3.5tn budget to expand social services, healthcare and climate change programs. “That’s giant,” said Fallon. “Biden’s spending money like his Gap rewards just kicked in. “Biden calls it the Human Infrastructure Plan – not really crazy about the term ‘human infrastructure’,” he added. “I’m picturing rich couples using other people as furniture.” Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been quietly working with airlines to wean them off fossil fuels by 2050. “By that time, all planes will be running on Hard Mountain Dew – and the pilots, too,” joked Fallon. Three major airlines – Delta, Southwest and American – will not require employees to be vaccinated. “That’s an odd twist,” said Fallon. “Frontier is now the classy airline. Didn’t see that one coming. “I mean, come on, Delta, you have the exact name – what are you doing?” Fallon wondered. “It probably explains their new slogan: Making Corona Hold Our Beer.” And the former New York mayor and personal lawyer to Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, has joined Cameo with personalized videos for $275 a pop. “He went from being America’s mayor to saying, ‘Hello, this is Rudy Giuliani, I want to wish deez nuts a happy retirement,” Fallon marveled."
"The actor Rafe Spall has spoken candidly about his struggles with his weight throughout his acting career, and the pressures of losing weight to look like a “normal guy”. Speaking on an upcoming episode of the Guardian podcast Comfort Eating with Grace Dent, the actor, who has appeared in films including Men in Black: International and Just Mercy, spoke about a recent “big-profile” job he did for television where his weight became a concern for production staff. Spall said he received a call from his agent saying that the staff were wondering if he had been looking after himself. They were concerned that he was looking a little overweight and wanted to get him a personal trainer. “Now, I was fit at this time,” Spall said. “I could run 5km in 20 minutes, and I was strong and fit. And it broke my heart. It was literally my worst nightmare coming true.” Spall opened up on the podcast, which airs on Tuesday, about how body image has affected him and his career. He said he was overweight as a child, but when he was 21 “embarked on a big voyage of weight loss”. He said that his role in the 2013 film I Give It a Year was his first lead part in a big romantic comedy. “It was made clear to me that I needed to lose weight in order to do the film,” he said. “And so, a trainer was laid on. I trained twice a day for 13 weeks to look like a ‘normal guy’.” “The fact is that in that film, which I’m really proud of – I love that film, – I had to do all of that just to look like a ‘normal person’. It wasn’t like I was playing a superhero or whatever – I was playing a normal guy,” he added. The actor addressed the pressures that both men and women in the entertainment industry face with regard to body image. “There is much in the public discourse about the terrible pressure that women are put under in the entertainment industry to live up to an unrealistic body shape,” he said. “The same is for me. It isn’t just me, it’s all men. And I don’t know who it’s for, on both sides, and I’m sick of it. “It’s worth saying that when you see films with men with their shirts off, my entire life and existence for four months was based around the way that I looked and I starved myself to look like that essentially. “I have to flog myself to [lose weight]. And I think it’s harmful. It’s harmful for me, the audience, for everyone.” Spall added that he has four projects coming up, and that he’s “thinking about food all the time”. “I’ve spent most of my adult life thinking about food,” he said. “I love food – it’s an axiom of the human experience for me. I get a deep enjoyment and sensuality from food. It’s part of my identity. But I think about my weight all the time. “I’m still having to go, ‘Jesus, I’ve got a part coming up, I’d better get into shape, I’d better start restricting my eating’. I’m still doing it because I’m so conditioned to do it.” Spall also acknowledged that his weight loss had benefited his career, and that when he first started losing weight, the “whole world treated me differently”. “The whole world did – my industry, my job, women. I was getting parts I wouldn’t usually get. It was like I turned this light on around me. “This is obviously a big part of my currency, that I am now thinner, so therefore people are more interested.” In the episode, to be published on 29 June, Spall also speaks about his father’s leukaemia diagnosis and how he met his wife, fellow actor Elize du Toit, on a blind date. All published episodes of Comfort Eating are available for listening here."
"Claudio Biern Boyd, creator and producer I grew up in Spain, with no TV in my house. For Christmas and birthdays, my family would give me action adventure books by classic authors such as Emilio Salgari, Jules Verne and Alexandre Dumas. When I was 16, I fell in love with the film Around the World in 80 Days with David Niven and Shirley MacLaine. I was fascinated how they had brought the book to life within the constraints of the film. In 1972 I co-founded my own company – BRB International – initially to distribute cartoons such as Pink Panther, Maya the Bee, Pippi Longstocking and Vicky the Viking in Spain, but soon we decided to make our own cartoons and teamed up with an established Japanese animation studio – Nippon Animation. I went back to the books I had loved as a child, and thought about how to turn them into cartoons. Our first project was Ruy, the Little Cid – based on the 11th-century Spanish hero. It was very successful, so I turned to Dumas’ Three Musketeers for my next inspiration. There was a lot of sword-fighting in the original story that we needed to soften for children, so we decided it would be more fun to use animals as the characters. I was living at the time with an American cocker spaniel called Sam, who was always wagging his tail. I thought: what could be better than a dog? So D’Artagnan, the fourth musteketeer, became Dogtanian. I bought two dog encyclopedias, placed them next to the Dumas book, and wrote the script. The main characters all became dogs, such as Dogtanian’s girlfriend Juliette, and the “Muskehounds” Arthos, Aramis and Porthos, and King Louis XIII, who was based on my dog Sam. The prime minister Cardinal Richelieu became an old fox, and we added some characters such as D’Artagnan’s sidekick Pip – a mouse. Milady, the devious spy, was a cat. I’ve never been fond of cats. Although the animation studio was based in Japan, Dogtanian was animated in English – as cartoons usually are, because the English language has the shortest movement of the lips. The first voices to be added were in Japanese in 1981, then Spanish in 1982, and finally into American English in 1985. There is a huge colony of Americans in Madrid because of Torrejón airbase, so we were able to cast American actors without having to look abroad. The series was a huge success around the world and especially on the BBC, who immediately bought the rights to our next cartoon, Around the World With Willy Fog. One of the things everyone remembers is the theme song: One for All and All for One. It was written by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis, two well-known Italian musicians who had written many TV and film scores. I flew to Rome to persuade them to work with me and it was the start of a great relationship – I am godfather to one of their children – and they went on to write for me for other projects. As a producer of cartoons, nobody knows my face, unlike if I was a big Hollywood producer. But when I give my name to make a restaurant reservation, or buy an airline ticket, or even when I was talking to the distributors in England for the new animated Dogtanian film – everyone starts singing the Dogtanian theme song at me. The same happens in Portugal, in France, in Italy. It’s unbelievable. Toni Garcia, original storyboard artist/director of the new film I was working as a storyboard artist when I first met Claudio in 1989. He was working on The Return of Dogtanian, which ran to a further 26 episodes, and was animated by a different Japanese studio and co-funded by Thames TV, and this time shown on CITV. Alexandre Dumas’s original Musketeers books are quite short, and so we had to add quite a lot of new story ourselves. The funny thing is that years later, the BBC did a live-action series called The Musketeers, which is supposed to be based on the original books but actually includes a lot of the plot from Dogtanian – even though it doesn’t have any dogs in it. The original cartoons always seem to bring up a lot of nostalgia. I am now the director of the new animated Dogtanian movie. We’ve been respectful – for example, we’ve re-recorded the theme song, but with a full symphony orchestra and chorus. One thing that we have changed are the female characters. In the original, they had relatively minor roles. Juliette especially was quite passive. Now she’s in charge of the team, very active and full of initiative. Some of the original Spanish voice actors are still alive so we were able to get them to be part of the Spanish version of the new movie. The Spanish actor who originally voiced Juliette – Gloria Cámara – is now 40 years older, so this time she plays Dogtanian’s mother."
"Ever since the Black Country Living Museum opened in 1978, there has been a daily ritual. As the doors fly open, especially on school trip days, mobs of kids stream in and sprint to Hobbs chip shop to gorge themselves on chunks of spuds cooked in genuine beef fat (now virtually outlawed) and eye-wateringly tart pickled onions (as they should be). Then, as the stuffed kids recline on the grass, pigeons would set about the leftovers. Over the years, the birds have grown bigger and bigger. “They were like footballs with wings,” says artist Kerri Williams, who is seated outdoors at the BCLM, busily painting floral designs on enamel mugs. “They could barely get airborne.” The museum has only just reopened meaning that, for the best part of a year, the pigeons were deprived. “Now,” says Williams, “they’re as skinny as supermodels.” Lockdown shrank more than avian waistlines. The BCLM has lost £5.5m since spring last year. “We usually have 350,000 visitors a year,” says director of programmes Carol King. “Last year it was 90,000 – and there was definitely a danger we could have closed for good.” Ticket sales and gift shop receipts (caps like the ones worn on Peaky Blinders, which was filmed at the museum, are bestsellers), not to mention pints of Banks’s bitter and cheese cobs at the Bottle and Glass Inn (which featured in Steve Coogan’s Laurel and Hardy biopic Stan and Ollie), account for 90% of its income. As early as March last year, museum staff realised that they were in trouble, so set up a JustGiving page for donations. “We’re sorry to ask at such a difficult time,” it read, “but we need your help now more than ever.” Visitors were asked to buy the £19.95 Unchained Pass, a ticket that gives admission for a year, and then visit after restrictions were eased. Then the second lockdown scuppered An Enchanted Christmas, a ticketed event, and for 147 days the museum was closed and earning nothing. Last July, it received £1.175m from Arts Council England’s emergency response fund. Amid the hardship, though, were sceptical voices. Some suspected the museum was flush because it had embarked on a £30m expansion called Forging Ahead that would add 22 new historical buildings and a visitor centre. But that budget could not be used to fund day-to-day operations. One of the few upsides was that builders could do some of the noisy groundwork for the project with the public out of the way. Most of the museum’s 270 staff were furloughed. Only a skeleton crew of horse wranglers and administrative staff tasked with finessing the museum’s social media profile were kept on. “I wanted to see that my canal boats were OK but we couldn’t come in,” says Williams. “It was a very sad time. I missed telling stories to kids of how Black Country people used to live.” Williams, like many of the museum’s volunteers, found her calling here. She used to work in IT before becoming one of the few artists who carry on the venerable art of canal painting. Today, she’s in Edwardian costume, sitting in the sun next to the water, happily dabbing yellow petals on her designs, preparing to shock children with horror stories about toilet arrangements back in the day. For fellow volunteer John Homer, lockdown was a mixed blessing. He was unable to perform his character of a flat-capped 1920s grandad, chatting to visitors on the cobbled street or inviting them into his terrace house. But he did become a TikTok star, his fireside chats amassing more than 22m views worldwide. Perhaps advice from a Black Country sage from 100 years ago was just what the Covid-stricken world needed. “Warro! Wait a minute. Doe scroll down!” Homer told TikTokers in one film. “I’ve got summat important to tell yow. Now I know some days are ’ard and I know it doe always go your road, believe yow me. But it’s OK to be sad and it’s OK to cry. That’s what makes us all ’uman. Breathe, relax and tek it one day at a time. It’ll be OK in the end. And if it ay well it ay the end is it?” And with that he swivelled back to warm his hands at the parlour fire. “I’d never heard of TikTok,” says Homer, “so the whole thing has been incredible. But it’s been a great way of connecting with kids who might never have heard of the Black Country and the Industrial Revolution.”  Other volunteers then made their own short, educational TikToks that function like bite-size Horrible Histories. In one, a mother makes her boy his Victorian packed lunch. She spreads pork dripping on bread, wraps the sandwich in cloth and puts a laconic note inside: “Ay it time yow gorra job, bab? It’s 1899 and you’m 12 years old.” The BCLM, although closed to physical visitors, became the most followed museum in the world on TikTok, outdoing more famous galleries, such as the Uffizi in Florence. Perhaps after lockdown, this social media boost will lead to tourists from all over with world coming to the Tipton Road to ride on its old-time trolley buses, get fitted for Peaky Blinders suits or go legging in the Dudley Canal tunnel (getting on top of a boat and propelling it with your legs on the tunnel roof). Meanwhile, on 22 January, the museum became the area’s first large Covid-19 vaccination centre. When I visited, there were as many people queueing for jabs as for the museum. The Black Country has proved itself an improbable tourist destination ever since the 1970s, when Cuddles the killer whale splashed the crowds at Dudley Zoo. True, legend has it that Queen Victoria closed the curtains when the royal train passed through the industry-scarred landscape; and yes, Tolkien did base Mordor on the Black Country – but the tourism sector is increasingly important for the post-industrial area and the museum, as the borough’s leading attraction, is key. “People are very proud to be from the Black Country,” says King, who hails from Donegal. “They see this museum as part of the community. I’m not sure many national museums have that.. Everything we’ve got is on display, most of it outdoors. Nothing is behind the scenes. We wear our hearts on our sleeves.” Black Country folk are known as yam yams because they – or rather we – say “yow am” rather than “you are”. As a son of Sedgley, I’m proud of what Queen Victoria disdained. It was my Black Country ancestors who built world’s first successful steam engine, forged the Titanic’s anchor, made most of the Crystal Palace. Mines, foundries, brickworks and glassworks dominated the landscape as the Black Country mercilessly exploited all its resources, include its human ones. It had a concentration and variety of industry scarcely paralleled elsewhere, not even in Birmingham for all its big talk about being a city of 1,000 trades. When I sat on my nan’s back step in Wednesbury in the 1970s, savouring the nocturnal vista of flaming furnaces around Bilston, what I saw was an enchanted land, though one already in its death throes. During my adult life, the BCLM has kept a flame of industrial heritage burning. Here, there are smoking chimneys, a drift mine experience, canal boats and horse-drawn traps – ways of living and working both lamentable and lovable. But for me the museum has always risked falling prey to the British disease of nostalgia, a Downton-isation of the soul, recreating the past while whitewashing its difficult aspects. And the Black Country does have a dark side. One of the new BCLM buildings will be a re-creation of the JH Lavender & Co aluminium foundry. Like many foundries from the 1960s onwards, it employed immigrants from south Asia prepared to do jobs white workers were not. Ninder Johal, a second-generation British Asian, told the local paper this replica foundry will be important in showing what his dad went through. “He spent his working life in smoky and hot furnaces. For my children and grandchildren, visiting the BCLM and seeing such industries depicted will provide a legacy enabling them to understand who they are and the role their grandfather and great-grandfather played in the industrial landscape of the UK.” But that immigrant experience was scarred by racism. In 1965, Malcolm X visited Smethwick during an election campaign in which the Tory candidate had the slogan: “If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.” Three years later, Wolverhampton MP Enoch Powell fanned the flames of racism with his “rivers of blood” speech in Birmingham. When I wrote about that notorious Smethwick campaign for the Guardian a few years ago, many British Asians I spoke to remembered “colour bars” in pubs, racist landlords, abuse in the street, barbers refusing to cut hair. How can a museum devoted to celebrating the past convey such things? The unpleasant side of the region’s history needs to be told, too. I wonder also what the Black Country identity amounts to in 2021, now the furnaces have gone cold and the metal bashers have stopped. When the BCLM comes to tell the post-industrial story, what will it look like? Is there more to say than how the smokestacks of Round Oak steelworks became Merry Hill shopping centre? Does the Black Country have a spirit now and, if so, what is it?  In the meantime, the BCLM has reopened, hopefully attracting TikTok users as much as yam yams. So far, the trolley buses aren’t running and the mine is closed. But otherwise, when I visited, things were looking up. Builders were working on the expansion, which is aimed at doubling visitor numbers to 500,000 a year. And having seen the queues at the chippie, there’s every reason to believe that Black Country pigeons are going to fatten up again."
"In the first episode of Netflix’s latest hit series, Get Organized With the Home Edit, Reese Witherspoon hires Clea Shearer and Joanna Teplin of The Home Edit fame (2.8m Instagram followers and counting) to swoop into her Nashville home and meticulously display her red carpet, Legally Blonde and Big Little Lies outfits. This show is a reality makeover love child of Tidying Up With Marie Kondo and Bobby Berk’s Queer Eye interior reveals, with star power. It sounds benign, but you can’t look away – nosiness is an incredible compulsion. As you watch, you start to wonder: how much does it cost to hire people like this (US$250 an hour, according to their website) and buy enough acrylic storage to organise a house? How much time do beautiful people with beautiful pantries spend pouring cereal into clear canisters? And what do the plastic containers look like when the cameras disappear, after a few months of fingerprints? Witherspoon is an executive producer on the show, and as the organisers pull on gloves to lovingly arrange her “memorabilia”, we’re introduced to Clea and Joanna’s all-white team, and their three-step method: edit, categorise, contain. First, the editing: the client – celebrities in the first half of each episode, normal people in the second – decides whether they can purge their existing collection. Then Clea and Joanna create “zones” to group items. In a pantry given The Home Edit treatment, for example, there’s zones for baking, breakfast and “backstock” (which for Khloé Kardashian means a wall of merchandise bearing her name; and for non-Kardashians, an extra bottle of washing liquid bought half price). Finally, “containing” which, unsurprisingly, involves containers. Lots of them: drawer inserts, bins, dividers, shelves, canisters, and lazy Susans. All of them are clear acrylic, and all are adorned with The Home Edit’s signature cursive labels (currently on sale). In theory, these are steps we can all apply to our possessions, but they take on an otherworldly grandiosity in the context of Clea and Joanna’s celebrity clients: Khloé Kardashian’s garage makeover features a miniature car-park for her daughter’s “toy” cars, including a replica Bentley. Stylist Rachel Zoe’s ginormous closet refresh involves “archiving” chunks of her grossly oversized collection of designer bags and shoes, plus dedicating an entire zone to vintage Chanel. The wider-than-ever chasm between us and them is just as clear as those acrylic boxes: seductive yet obscene, aspirational yet excessive. While the celebrity projects are the indisputable drawcard, an ordinary client is injected into each episode as a foil for the museum-esque mansions. A family of four with too many water bottles hasn’t cleared out their kitchen in 12 years. Another client’s shed is dominated by old things they want to sell but haven’t. A stack of papers visible through a clear tub in a kids’ room is “disgusting-looking”, suggesting the pornographic perfection of perfectly spaced plastic bins and “rainbow order” bookshelves isn’t achievable for everyone. If you want a home that’s “categorised and contained”, the show implies, you need to be able to afford the right stuff: for instance Clea and Joanna’s “kitchen storage solution”, which will set you back $495.67, plus $265.66 shipping to Australia. Appreciating what you have apparently costs a lot and requires buying more. And yet, Get Organized With the Home Edit is just as intoxicating as Selling Sunset and Million Dollar Beach House were – we’ve never spent so much time in our spaces, and are therefore newly familiar with their possibilities and shortcomings, and mesmerised by grander ones. At the same time, though, celebrities feel more unrelatable and disconnected from reality than ever: singing Imagine in a show of “solidarity” as the virus kills people; moaning about how lockdown spent in sickeningly large estates is like “prison”; and, now, showing off overstocked fridges and overflowing closets while many struggle to put food on the table during a recession. Clea and Joanna tell one client they can’t organise their life, only their home. But the secret hope is that those outcomes overlap. One woman speaks of how her family’s kitchen makeover will lead to easier and better Thanksgivings, Christmases and birthdays. Another set of parents have the pair convert their biological son’s bedroom into one that will also function for their foster son, welcoming him into his new home and family. Of course perfection is a short-lived illusion, even for the rich and famous. Zoe’s “before” closet is full of bulky garment racks heaving and rustling with dozens of plastic dry cleaning bags, despite having already been organised by the team once before. Still, I went from having never heard of The Home Edit to gulping down this eight-episode series in a day, followed by a compulsive scroll of the business’ Instagram feed. It left me longing for more space, but also grateful for the way my rented, one-bedroom apartment holds the things that make up my life. In an uncontrollable year, perhaps we can find solace in a new acrylic container, or 20, that will help us control the space we live in. At least for a while."
"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it All TV soaps are driven by tragedy: it’s a well-known fact that if the Great British public don’t get at least one brutal death every Christmas Day, they’ll take to the streets and riot. But which soap family is the unluckiest? Looking at the stats, you’d think it was a family from Hollyoaks, given that the village has seen a horrifying 96 murders in just 25 years, which officially makes it more dangerous to have a pint in the Dog in the Pond than live in Tijuana. In reality, you would simply just move somewhere safer. However, consider Emmerdale’s Dingle family: the 11 (yes, 11) generations of Dingles have seen 13 family members die – in car crashes, bus crashes, by suicide and falls from multistorey car parks. And if you can find an Emmerdale fan who didn’t cry when Lisa died of amyloidosis on her wedding day, I’ll show you a monster. You could consider Hollyoaks’ McQueens similarly cursed. Over the years, family members have died in increasingly bizarre ways: Tina was blown up in a church, while Carmel died in a train crash and Lily got sepsis. Poor Mercedes has been stalked by a serial killer, strangled and shot – but still survived. Coronation Street’s Platt family are particularly unfortunate. They’ve survived Richard Hillman’s murder-suicide attempt (he drove the family car into the canal); con man Lewis Archer stole Gail’s life savings just a few years after she was falsely imprisoned for the death of her husband Joe; another ex, Brian, was stabbed to death; and David’s wife Kylie died in his arms after being knifed in the street. Also, poor Sarah had postpartum psychosis; baby Bethany accidentally swallowed an ecstasy tablet; and Audrey was swindled out of £80k by her grandson Nick. After all that, a sinkhole opened up beneath their home. You couldn’t make it up! Only, of course, the scriptwriters did. Despite such horrors, surely the most unlucky soap clan is EastEnders’ Beale family. To share a last name with Ian Beale is to sign your own death certificate. He has been married six times to five women and three of them are now dead: Mel walked into the path of a speeding lorry; Cindy died in prison giving birth; while Laura tripped over a child’s toy and broke her neck. Only his third wife Jane – after being “accidentally” shot and then trapped in a fire – managed to escape Albert Square with her life. Ian’s mum, Kathy, has dealt with two sexual assaults, a violent marriage to Phil Mitchell, her daughter’s drug overdose, and “died” in a car crash in 2006, only to return in 2015. The one scrap of luck Kathy has had – ever – was convincing Albert Square’s residents that it’s OK to charge £6 for a coffee and a bacon roll in the caff. Ian’s kids aren’t faring much better: daughter, Lucy, was killed by her own brother, Bobby; and Ian’s adopted son, Steven, was murdered by Max Branning. But isn’t the unluckiest part of all of this that they’re related to soap’s most miserable, whiny, sneaky weasel? Ian is a coward who would double-cross his own mum over the last biscuit in the packet. There is no worse luck for a soap character than to be related to or, even worse, have sex with Ian Beale. Honestly, you’d rather move to Hollyoaks and take your chances. "
"It could have been an image from 2019 – a sea of mostly unmasked faces, shoulder to shoulder, singing to live music in Chicago’s Grant Park. The mass gathering of about 100,000 people daily for Lollapalooza 2021, one of the country’s most prominent music festivals, featuring Foo Fighters and Post Malone, on the last weekend of July was a welcome sight to music lovers – and a worrisome event for public health officials as cases of the Delta variant of Covid-19 surge in the US. The photos now appear like the last naive gasp of pandemic-free fantasy; in the two weeks since Lollapalooza, which required either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test to attend, the rapid spread of the Delta variant has forced a slate of upcoming music festivals to reassess health and safety plans at a pivotal moment for handling of the pandemic in the US. Prominent festivals such as Tennessee’s Bonnaroo and Milwaukee’s Summerfest, both scheduled for September, will now require vaccinations or a negative Covid test within 72 hours of the festival. Bonnaroo will also require masks in indoor spaces, while Summerfest will require them for children under 12 who are ineligible for the vaccine. The New Orleans jazz and heritage festival in October was cancelled outright, with organizers citing the “current exponential growth of new Covid cases in New Orleans and the region and the ongoing public health emergency”. LiveNation, the largest operator of live events in the country, authorized its venues and artists to enact vaccine requirements at their discretion in a “best practices” memo. On Thursday, AEG Presents, the second-largest live events company, followed suit with a stronger policy requiring proof of vaccination for ticket holders and crew at all the venues it owns or operates in the US. Artists from Jason Isbell to Lucinda Williams to Japanese Breakfast have said they will only perform at venues that require vaccinations or a negative Covid test; Stevie Nicks cancelled all her remaining 2021 performances. The ground beneath organizers’ feet has been shifting quickly, as state and local municipalities react to surging case numbers and, in some states, ICUs once again full of Covid patients. Philadelphia’s Made in America music festival, expected to draw between 50,000 and 60,000 people on Labor Day weekend for such A-list music acts as Justin Bieber, Megan Thee Stallion and Lil Baby, had held off on announcing Covid restrictions until this week, deferring to city guidance. On Wednesday afternoon, Philadelphia officials unveiled sweeping new Covid restrictions, including masks and vaccination proof for all indoor businesses, and mask mandates for unseated outdoor festivals. It was always the plan, as stated on the festival’s website, to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Philadelphia city guidance, Desiree Perez, the CEO of RocNation, which runs Made in America, told the Guardian. As such, the festival will now require masks and proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test. “They’ve come up with this new mandate and we will implement it,” she said. “It doesn’t bring joy to me that we have to check vaccination cards and 48-hour tests and check IDs and make sure that they’re not fake or passing along fake vaccination cards,” said Perez, who said the festival has worked with city health officials throughout the planning process. “It’s not something that any festival or any public business is interested or happy to do. But we have to all chip in as a country to do what’s best for all of us and keep us moving forward.” The shift in Covid protocols aligns with recommendations from epidemiologists, who advise layering preventive measures such as masks, social distancing and frequent testing of asymptomatic people on top of vaccinations. “It’s a significant public health risk to hold music festivals that don’t maintain other types of precautions, like social distancing or face mask use,” said Dr Bruce Y Lee, the executive director of Cuny’s Public Health Informatics Computational and Operations Research and a professor at its Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. A multi-pronged approach helps mitigate the virus’s spread and buys critical time to protect hospitals, keep schools open and vaccinate more people. “When you have that many people gathered who are talking and singing and are coming from different households and geographic locations, you should err on the side of caution,” said Dr Bertha Hidalgo, a genetic epidemiologist and professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Potential transmission is not limited to the concert itself; attendees could spread the virus on the journey to and from the festival, in bathrooms or stores on site, or in hotels. “There are a lot of areas and potential for exposure above and beyond what may happen outdoors at the festival,” said Hidalgo. The concern is not so much death or severe illness for vaccinated concertgoers – most breakthrough infections, which are very rare, result in a mild cold or flu-like symptoms; the rate of death for infection with the vaccine is, according to a recent report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, “effectively zero”. Rather, it’s the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant among partly vaccinated communities, which could overwhelm hospitals and healthcare workers and risk the development of new variants. Not all festivals are responding to the risks of transmission with new protocols. Pepsi’s Rock the South, to be held this weekend in Cullman, Alabama, is expected to draw close to 30,000 people for performances by major country stars including Miranda Lambert, Luke Combs and the Marshall Tucker Band. Alabama has one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates, with 35% of the population fully vaccinated. The festival’s website currently does not list any hard Covid restrictions, though masks and hand sanitizer will reportedly be available. (Rock the South’s organizers, 46 Entertainment and Premier Productions, could not be reached for comment.) Rock the South’s founder and organizer, Shane Quick, told the podcast Outbreak Alabama this week that attendees should be vaccinated “if it’s something you’re worried about”. Quick added that his family, and festival organizers were vaccinated, but the festival itself would not advocate for vaccinations. “You know in this state, in this part of the world, people don’t react well to being told what to do,” he said. “You have to let people make their own decisions.” The question should not be of personal safety, Dr Mike Levy, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, told the Guardian. “This is a public health issue. Should these municipalities be allowing these events to occur when the spread that is likely to happen in these events is going to get outside the events? “This isn’t about one’s personal risk of going to a dangerous outside transmission event and getting it,” Levy said. “Probably no one in these concerts is going to die, but they’re going to bring it home and someone’s grandparent is going to die.” As of now, the show will go on for most festivals. Perez, of RocNation, said Made in America will take place on Labor Day unless the city of Philadelphia declares otherwise. “For health purposes, if the city determined that we couldn’t be open, then obviously we would respect that,” she said. “But if not, we’re going to move forward.” On Thursday, Chicago’s top doctor, Dr Allison Arwady, said 203 cases of Covid-19 were linked to Lollapalooza, with no hospitalizations or deaths – a number she cast as “not unexpected” and which presented “no evidence” that the festival was a super-spreader event. Festivals such as Rock the South and Made in America “have the potential to be done safely”, said Hidalgo, “assuming that they’re putting scientifically backed protocols in place”, such as vaccinations requirements, mask mandates and spaced-out crowds. “We all have to figure this out one way or another,” said Perez. Covid is, at this point, “here to stay, unfortunately. This is a problem that we all face as a country.”"
"“Let’s rip the Band-Aid off: the Taliban have taken over Afghanistan,” said Stephen Colbert on Monday’s Late Show, as the Afghan government, the country’s armed forces and its capital, Kabul, collapsed just days after the US began the withdrawal of troops. “The US has been there for 20 years, we spent $2tn, we trained a 300,000-man-strong Afghan army – and the Taliban took it over in 10 days,” Colbert recapped. “It’s hard to argue that the White House didn’t shank the withdrawal,” he continued. The rapid fall of Afghanistan’s western-backed democratic government and chaos in Kabul – chaos at Hamid Karzai airport caused the deaths of at least seven people – swiftly disproved the Biden administration’s calculations of a smooth withdrawal. A Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was “not inevitable” and “highly unlikely”, Biden said on 8 July. “That is the most inaccurate prediction from a president since Abe Lincoln said ‘see you after the play!’” Colbert joked. But Colbert added that criticism from Republicans over Biden’s handling of the situation didn’t hold water; Trump’s policies as president – reducing US troops from 15,000 to 2,500, negotiating a ceasefire with the Taliban without the Afghan government, convincing the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners – “set the stage” for the “debacle”. Trump figures blaming Biden for the mess is “like Andrew Lloyd Webber calling Cats a terrible movie,” he said. “You wrote a musical with no plot – how did you think this was gonna end? “We’ve had troops there for 20 years – they fought, they sacrificed, their families sacrificed so that we wouldn’t have a terrorist attack in America planned in a foreign country,” he continued. “Why should our soldiers be fighting radicals in a civil war in Afghanistan? We’ve got our own on Capitol Hill.” Like the initial invasion 20 years ago, the withdrawal of US troops is supported by the majority of Americans – as much as 70%. “Do you know how few things 70% of Americans agree on?” said Colbert. “I think it’s this and extra cheese, which also often ends badly and faster than you planned. “So, in the end, you can make us accept that there was no good alternative, but you can’t make us feel good about it,” he concluded. “The only people who can feel good about this are the service members and their families who aren’t going to see soldiers sent into harm’s way for no reason that the commander-in-chief of either party can articulate. “For the last 20 years, four separate administrations told the American people to care about the plight of all the Afghan people, especially the women,” he added. “And we did care. And that’s not going to change. All that’s changed is that there’s nothing we can do about it now. So pulling out may be the right thing to do, but it’s heartbreaking. It’s humbling when the right thing feels so wrong.” The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and Taliban takeover marks the end to a “20-year, bipartisan foreign policy disaster that American officials of both parties bear responsibility and which they have repeatedly lied about,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. Meyers stressed the bipartisan, dismissing an attempt by Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state, to claim, on Fox News, that the Taliban takeover wouldn’t have happened under the Trump administration. “You think the Trump plan would’ve been more orderly than what’s happening now?” Meyers fumed. “You guys were the ones who wanted to withdraw by May. I have a hard time believing Trump would’ve done it in a more orderly way since nothing he ever did was orderly. He couldn’t even withdraw from an umbrella in an orderly fashion. “Instead of armchair generals engaging in craven political point-scoring, what we need right now is everyone calling for the US to accept as many Afghan refugees as possible,” he continued, calling on the Biden administration to offer asylum to any Afghan refugees who wish to come to the US. “It’s the bare minimum we can do, and we should be doing it as fast as possible. “The majority of Americans want the forever war in Afghanistan to end, it should’ve ended a long time ago. Ending it now is the only option,” he concluded. “But one thing we can and must do right now and is accept as many refugees, and grant as many Afghans asylum, as we possibly can, as quickly as we can.”"
"The first time many Americans heard about Larry Kramer was from an interview he gave to NBC News in 1983, in which he spelled out for journalist Jane Pauley what, exactly, was happening to the gay community. Pauley asked him how many friends he had lost to Aids. Kramer’s reply: 20. Pauley seemed genuinely shocked at that number and repeated it back to him, as if to make sure she wasn’t mis-hearing. “Can you imagine what it would be like if you had lost 20 of your friends in the last 18 months?” he asked.  And then he spoke the truth he wanted the American people to hear: “There’s no question in my mind, if this were happening to you and the white, straight middle-class community it would have been attended to a long time ago.” With that interview, Larry Kramer staked out the terms upon which the war over Aids would be fought. He never backed down from it in the 37 years that followed. Of course, in 1983, Larry Kramer was no stranger to the New York gay community. His 1978 novel Faggots, in which he described the community as he had experienced and observed it, anal warts and all, made him persona non grata. While Kramer considered himself a truth-teller, many considered him a traitor. The book was banned from the Oscar Wilde Bookstore, Kramer was banned from his local grocery store on Fire Island. And yet, it’s still read by young gay men today. The first time I began to seriously engage with Kramer’s life and his work was from reading a 2001 article in Newsweek magazine whose headline was: The Angry Prophet is Dying. Describing the liver disease that was a result of his HIV treatment, the piece featured a photo of Kramer in his underwear, his belly distended, as if “pregnant with triplets”. Quoting an infectious disease specialist who predicted Kramer had “18 months or a year, maybe less” to live, the piece read as a pre-obituary, preparing its readers for the imminent demise of this titan of gay rights. Ever the contrarian, he lived another 19 years. No one was going to tell Larry Kramer when the fuck to die. Larry Kramer was that rare beast in American letters: a full-time writer and a full-time activist. The two often overlapped but they always remained distinct. The closest amalgam I can think of to him was James Baldwin and, before him, perhaps Edward Carpenter.  It was with his Roman candle of a play, The Normal Heart, that his two lives most directly intersected. There isn’t much that makes me wish I had been an adult in the 1980s, but being able to have seen that original production at the Public Theatre might have been a strong inducement. I cannot think of another play in my lifetime that captured the spirit of a time (by the throat) as blisteringly alive as that play did. One feels as though it must be read with oven mitts.  Nancy Piccione, the director of casting at Manhattan Theatre Club, once told me a story about being the casting associate at the Public when The Normal Heart was about to go into production. In those days before emails and PDFs, actors would travel to the theatre and check out a copy of the script, as if taking it from the library. Nancy told me of the actors who would return their copy to her, shaken to the core by what they had just read. On more than one occasion, an actor told her they couldn’t audition for the play because it would be too painful to perform in it. I met Larry Kramer only once. It was in the spring of 2019 at a panel discussion at NYU to discuss the legacy of Stonewall on queer culture and queer theatre. I was flanked on the stage by Larry and my mentor, Terrence McNally, another giant we lost this blighted year. When asked of the importance of Stonewall, Larry characteristically answered, “it isn’t important at all”, which got a surprised reaction from the crowd. I think I know what he meant. Stonewall, while an unquestionably galvanizing moment in queer history, brought visibility to our community. But it did not bring change to our society. It took the fight against Aids, which began a little over a decade later, to do that. Stonewall might have been the Big Bang, but the fight against Aids, which cannot be told without Larry Kramer, is what made the queer community a global community and an unstoppable political force. In revisiting Larry Kramer’s life, I cannot help but think about the world he exited. It is sadly fitting that the United States slouched to 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus on the very day that he died. One has to but look at the statistics to see that this has become a black disease, a Latinx disease and a disease of poverty. As states begin reopening earlier than medical experts advise, as middle-class white Americans insist it is their constitutional right to go clothes shopping, to go to parties and to hair salons – all without wearing masks – I look back at Kramer’s words to Jane Pauley: “There’s no question in my mind, if this were happening to you and the white, straight middle-class community it would have been attended to a long time ago.” The angry prophet has died. His prophecies live on."
"Stephen Colbert addressed “the big story everybody’s talking about right now” on Thursday’s Late Show, “which continues to be the chaos surrounding the poorly handled regime change … over at Jeopardy!”. The renowned quiz show had drawn criticism all week for its selection of Mike Richards to succeed the late Alex Trebek as host. After a months-long host search that included tryouts from such celebrity candidates as Anderson Cooper, LeVar Burton, Katie Couric and Aaron Rodgers, the show’s executive producers chose Richards, Jeopardy!’s executive producer with little public profile, as permanent host. (Big Bang Theory star Miyam Bialik will host the show’s primetime tournaments.) “Wow, what are the odds?” Colbert deadpanned. “Exactly the same as me getting named Stephen Colbert magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive.” Richards had already drawn public scrutiny before his selection as host for multiple lawsuits dating to his time as executive producer of The Price is Right in the early 2010s, which alleged mistreatment of female employees and pregnancy discrimination. The suits were settled out of court. On Wednesday, the Ringer followed up with excerpts from a podcast Richards hosted in 2014, in which he made crude comments about women, Jews and Haiti. In one episode, Richards asked his two co-hosts, both younger women, if they had ever taken nude photos, “like booby pictures”. “‘Booby pictures?’” Colbert mocked. “Is this the man about to become the host of America’s most beloved quizshow or a 12-year-old boy trying to sneak into an R-rated movie?” In light of the audio excerpts, Richards released a statement, saying: “It’s more than clear that my attempts to be funny and provocative were not acceptable, and I have removed the episodes.” “That’s an interesting apology,” said Colbert, who compared it to saying: “I know I drove drunk and plowed through your rose garden, and to prove I’m sorry, I recycled my empty liquor bottles.” On Friday morning, Richards stepped down as Jeopardy! host. “For a year and a half we’ve been battling a deadly virus to save as many lives as possible,” said Seth Meyers on Thursday night, while the GOP’s “main priority is standing in the way and making it harder”. The Late Night host pointed in particular to Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, who has blocked schools from implementing mask mandates and opposed hospitals requiring employees to be vaccinated, even as the state faces some of the highest rates of Covid cases in the US. “He also does that Trump thing where he says a line he thinks the crowd loves but if you think about it, it just doesn’t make any sense,” Meyers said, pointing to a recent quote from a DeSantis press conference: “Politicians want to force you to cover your face as a way for them to cover their own asses, that’s just the truth.” “What does he mean?” Meyers mused. “Has he been reading bumper stickers outside the Tampa AutoZone? I know it sounds like an applause line because it’s short and pithy and people clap at the end, but it doesn’t actually make any sense. “We need a layered approach: vaccines, masks, ventilation,” he added. “I don’t know why rightwingers get so mad about this. Complex problems require complex solutions. They don’t want to hear that, which is why they’ve spent the entirety of the pandemic lining up behind a guy who once asked his medical advisers if we could just give people a flu shot to cure them of coronavirus.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon ticked through a litany of business and culture news. First, the release of the film Paw Patrol in theaters this weekend. “There’s a lot riding on this movie,” he said. “If it’s a hit, it could lead to the next wave of drunk characters in Times Square.” Meanwhile, Amazon announced plans to open several department stores across the US. “It’s all part of Amazon’s plan to put Amazon out of business,” Fallon joked. And the website OnlyFans announced that it’s going to block all explicit content starting in October. “What? This would be like Playboy only printing articles,” said Fallon. “If you’re watching this with someone and they quickly ask ‘what’s OnlyFans?’ trust me, they know exactly what it is.”"
"It goes without saying that Wednesday’s smooth, benignly star-studded inauguration for Joe Biden was a startling change of pace for Washington – the stark, horrifying images of teargas and Maga rioters storming the nation’s Capitol two weeks ago replaced with masked celebrities, odes to American diversity, and earnest, if likely unreciprocated, calls for healing. Capping this secure (thanks to nearly 25,000 national guardsmen), surprisingly smooth event was the 90-minute celebrity extravaganza known as Celebrating America, a collection of musical performances, tributes to America’s essential workers, and nods to better days ahead that played like a technically competent, mostly seamless Zoom telethon for unity. The special benefitted from perhaps the perfect choice as host: Tom Hanks, the beloved everyman actor and one of the few cultural figures on whom most Americans can agree (and also the celebrity whose coronavirus diagnosis on 11 March 2020 was, for many, the moment the direness of the pandemic really sank in). In front of the Lincoln Memorial, the actor most associated with bone-deep decency and ordinary heroism held together a staccato and still-surreal pandemic mix of socially distanced live footage and desktop webcam aesthetics. The evening was ostensibly, in title and structure, intended to honor such Hanksian heroism on the national stage; the zippy 90 minutes was delineated by category of American hero – those who, as title cards spelled out, “feed us” (food pantry workers, farmers), care for us (nurses and medical professionals), teach us (teachers), supply us (delivery workers), among others – represented by single private citizens from around the country. Ordinary heroism quickly bowed to celebrity culture, however, as each hero introduced musical performances, some live and some pre-taped, that cut across generation and genre: Bruce Springsteen, a cringeworthy rendition of Here Comes the Sun by Bon Jovi in Miami, the Foo Fighters coming for your throat with hope for the future, Justin Timberlake doing his Memphis thing with Better alongside Ant Clemons, Katy Perry closing the evening with Firework to some admittedly impressive fireworks over DC. The more successful performances leaned into the heady emotions of the day: anticipation (John Legend’s beautiful take on Feelin’ Good), grief (Yolanda Adams’s performance of Hallelujah, soundtracking a recap of nationwide memorials to the 400,000 Americans now lost to the coronavirus), joyful silliness (Broadway singers hamming it up in a virtual collaboration with the energy of your cousin jumping into the Zoom call two mimosas deep). Still, the cumulative effect of several bland to outright cringingly hollow performances (specifically, Tim McGraw and Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard’s duet on the colorblind country dud Undivided) gave the evening the feel of a come-down from a previous high. Celebrity tributes to American resilience from Eva Longoria and Lin-Manuel Miranda, brief addresses from Biden and the vice-president, Kamala Harris, that hit all the requisite notes, and an almost endearingly awkward riff on peaceful transfers of power from Bill Clinton, George W Bush, and Barack Obama (standing 6ft apart) peppered the evening with gestures of lost stability and hope. But Celebrating America felt less like a party than a denouement from the day’s earlier celebrations, especially the youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman’s unassailable performance – a parade of good intentions back to the ordinariness of performing American optimism, albeit with social distancing protocols and celebrity webcams. But if I come across as a grouch about this show, it’s only because I’m thrilled to have a bar for national celebrations and observance of presidential power that is not below the ground. After four years of a presidency that ignored basic science, elevated white supremacy and plunged the turbo-charged news cycle to ridiculous depths of stupidity, to suffer blandness feels like a blessing. To begrudge a little corniness, celebrity, or a slightly awkward performance? A luxury. The stakes in Celebrating America felt soothingly low, at worst annoying, sometimes silly, never sinister – not perfect, but beyond welcome."
"After a safe, peaceful swearing-in ceremony for Joe Biden, a deep cleaning of the White House and a celebrity-filled virtual celebration, Stephen Colbert felt “enormous relief” for the US, he said on a live Late Show following inauguration day. “It’s like we’ve been on a ship that’s been in a storm for four years and we just stepped on to dry land.” Biden’s inauguration, replete with a stirring performance by the youth poet laureate, Amanda Gorman, and a presidential address grounded in facts, represented a “return to normalcy”, Colbert continued, although one marked by the still-surreal calamity of the pandemic. But “even though it was abnormal, at least we understood why it was abnormal”, he said. A year to the day after the first US patient was hospitalized with Covid, the incoming administration structured the day around clear Covid safety protocols. “So many times during the last four years, we were all like, ‘What the hell is happening? Why is this happening?’” Colbert said of the prior administration. “And they wouldn’t tell us. They wouldn’t tell us the real reasons, because everything was a sales job. And the weirdest feeling in the world is when something is clearly abnormal and someone tries to tell you that it’s not. “What we saw today was the opposite of gaslighting,” he added. “Today we were reality-boarded, and I am here for it.” Colbert also celebrated the historic inauguration of America’s first female vice-president, Kamala Harris. “It’s a moment that future generations will look back on and say, ‘wow, that took a long time,’” he said. Harris becomes not only the first female, first black and first south Asian American VP, but also “the first vice-president in four years who doesn’t think yogurt is too spicy”, he joked. “Despite the pandemic, this inauguration had it all,” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. Highlights included: former president; the youngest inaugural poet in Gorman; “an amazing singer wearing her own Etsy store” with Lady Gaga in her Hunger Games-esque get-up; “an old man on his way to the post office” in Bernie Sanders, with his Vermont dad-chic mittens; and “even a lady whose outfit called me a broke bitch” with Michelle Obama in a wide-legged fuchsia suit. Immediately following the ceremony, Biden signed 15 executive orders, including measures to rejoin the Paris climate accord, shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, reverse the ban on travel and immigration from several Muslim-majority countries, mandate masks on federal lands for 100 days and extend the pause on student debt collection. “Let’s just say, the White House bathrooms aren’t the only place Biden is looking to wipe out any trace of Donald Trump,” Noah explained, calling the flurry of orders a “huge reversal of Trump’s legacy”. “Although with America’s Covid rates right now, I don’t actually think that last one is gonna make much of a difference,” he added about the infamous Muslim ban. Despite Biden’s inaugural plea for unity, “Republicans are furious that Joe Biden chose to divide America by becoming president,” joked Samantha Bee on Full Frontal. “And if that weren’t divisive enough, he’s openly plotting to do stuff.” With control of the White House, Senate and House, “Democrats are in an unimaginable position: we can finally do things that help people!” Bee said. “For the next two years, we can confirm liberal judges and pass legislation that doesn’t suck.” Bee looked ahead to possible Democratic achievements on paid family leave, universal pre-school, debt-free community college, and some form of student debt forgiveness. Their slim majority in the Senate, however, won’t allow for every Biden-Harris idea; if the new administration wants to restore the Voting Rights Act, pass immigration reform, or pursue statehood for DC and Puerto Rico, which will require GOP Senate votes, Biden will “end up facing the Klan’s Gambit”, Bee joked over an image of the Republican senators Mitch McConnell, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham, all abetters of Trump’s baseless election fraud claims. Wednesday’s inauguration was “a little like getting rid of the last guy at a party”, joked Seth Meyers on Late Night. “We spent four years yawning and stretching and hinting that he should get out, and then when he finally leaves it is a relief until you remember that you have to clean up all his puke, and he, like, puked everywhere.” The celeb-stuffed affair included performances from Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga – “a nice break from the Trump era, when the only musical acts who would associate with the president were 3 Doors Down and the kids who got stiffed by Trump”, he added, referring to USA Freedom Kids, who performed at Trump’s rallies and later sued him for lack of pay. Meyers also turned to Biden’s moving inaugural address, in which he urged Americans to rise above partisanship and face the challenges of the pandemic, systemic racism and inequality together. “Republicans incited an insurrection, and then complained that Democrats aren’t trying to unify the nation,” Meyers said. “Meanwhile, Biden talked more about unity than a marriage counselor who only gets paid if the couple stays together.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recalled Donald Trump’s inauguration four years ago, a “terrible day” during which he wondered: “Can our country survive for years of this?” “And now we know the answer: not really,” he said. “Just barely. But we made it.” Kimmel also reflected on the tale of two Wednesdays in January 2021: “Two weeks ago, a bunch of dangerous imbeciles with Donald Trump flags tried to overthrow the government. Today, on that very same spot, we had the national anthem sung by Lady Gaga. To paraphrase Michelle Obama, when they go low, we go J Lo.” “And while Joe Biden was being sworn in, in Florida at Mar-a-Lago, an omelet bar attendant was being sworn at,” Kimmel added, as Trump slinked off to his Florida golf course following a sparsely attended morning sendoff in Washington. Trump’s sons Eric and Don Jr waved their father off with visible tears – “it is heartbreaking to see children separated from their parents, isn’t it?” Kimmel mused with a final jab at Trump’s legacy on immigration and family separation."
"The classic multi-camera format of traditional sitcoms – think brightly lit studio sets, audible laughter, broad comedy – has mostly fallen out of favour as the less restrictive single-camera format has taken the genre to more sophisticated heights in shows like The Office, The Good Place and Schitt’s Creek. The first hint of canned laughter is often enough to put people off, which may be why no one I know has watched the joyous 2017 series One Day at a Time. The focus of this multi-cam sitcom, a reimagining of the 1975 series, is Cuban-American army veteran and nurse Penelope Alvarez, who lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Los Angeles with her teenage children, Elena and Alex, and mother, Lydia. It’s a simple set-up, but its impressive pedigree and deep pathos ensure it holds its own among the best of the genre. One Day is developed by legendary producer Norman Lear, who produced the original and has a legacy of introducing progressive ideas and controversial topics into the homes of millions via such shows as All in the Family and The Jeffersons. He was, thankfully, wise enough in his 90s to know that an old white man isn’t the right person to write a story about a Latinx single mother, so recruited Cuban-American writer Gloria Calderón Kellett as co-showrunner, who developed the show to reflect her own experiences. A commitment to authenticity trickled down to the writing team, which in the first season was half women and half Latinx. The strong cast is led by an irresistible performance from Justina Machado as Penelope. Machado has long been a strong supporting actor – I know her best from the stunning Six Feet Under – but her ability to balance dramatic weight and infectious effervescence suggests she should have been starring all along. As flamboyant abuelita Lydia, living treasure Rita Moreno is likely the only EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony winner) to ever star in a sitcom. Drawing on an unparalleled career, Moreno brings poignancy, humanity and sexuality to a role that could easily devolve into caricature. Young actors Isabella Gomez and Marcel Ruiz ably round out the Alvarez family cast; Gomez in particular has a lot to contend with as her character, Elena, comes out during the course of season one and faces heartbreaking rejection from her father. Notably, all four leads are Latinx. The writers have capitalised on the acting talent by imbuing every episode with heavy issues, from Trump and immigration to sexist micro-aggressions to post-traumatic stress. Each is handled with depth and compassion, often via multi-generational clashes in which equal space is given to all perspectives, allowing characters to grow and change in response. The result is compelling. I dare you to get through more than a few episodes without tears. The specificity of telling authentic stories like these paradoxically makes the show strikingly relatable. It doesn’t matter that I’m not a Cuban-American teenager who came out at my quinceañera; what matters is that the story arc was written by a Latinx woman who had a similar coming-out experience, and as a result the story feels real. It doesn’t matter that I’ve never experienced the trauma of fleeing my home country as a child, as Lydia did; what matters is that Moreno left hers at age five and never saw her brother again, and this authenticity comes through in the show. The intense realness underpinning the material circumvents any cultural chasms, connecting deeply on a human level. While One Day has rightly received praise for its Latinx and queer representation, it is as remarkable for its depiction of a formidable matriarchy. Despite their differences, all three generations of Alvarez women navigate life’s challenges with that distinctly feminine combination of strength, wisdom and empathy. The positive effect this has on young Alex is a quiet but convincing case for the power of female leadership. Consistently appearing in critics’ “best of” lists and holding a near-perfect critical score on Rotten Tomatoes wasn’t enough to keep One Day afloat: Netflix cancelled the series after three seasons, citing too few viewers. A strong social media campaign saw US network Pop TV save it for a fourth season (which is unfortunately unavailable to stream in Australia at the time of writing), but Covid delays and network changes permanently killed it late last year. The cancellation may be par for the course in an increasingly ruthless streaming landscape but it feels particularly exasperating that a universally adored show by and about women of colour was deemed disposable. Moreover, as distressing global events continue to develop around us, the wisdom and warmth of the Alvarez family is exactly what we need more of. For now, 39 glorious episodes will have to suffice."
"Joan Bakewell writes in her memoir, The Centre of the Bed, about the moment she became an adult. It was 1949 and she was 17, a hard- working grammar schoolgirl from the industrial north, when her frustrated, depressive mother found a photograph of Joan kissing a boy and set fire to it in front of her eyes. Joan felt deep shame, but the shame began to transmogrify. “Suddenly I was savagely and tremblingly angry,” she writes. “I was being forged in some bitter fire of my mother’s will, and I must survive the moment and emerge as myself. That was the end of innocence, not the loss of virginity or any fumbling that fell short of it. It was when I crossed into adulthood, knew my own mind and was sure of who I was.” Soon afterwards she left for university, where she joyfully discovered the world of ideas, as well as the one of sex, even though, as a student of the Cambridge women’s college Newnham, such things were banned. So it interests me, on the morning I am to interview Bakewell, who has been a pioneering woman in media for more than half a century, to read that Oxford University is seeking to ban its dons from having sexual relationships with students. This is being promoted as a progressive, feminist move, presumably to outlaw sexual exploitation and conflicts of interest, but I have a feeling Bakewell will be having none of this. I ask her, over Zoom, and from her desk in Primrose Hill, she laughs. “I thought about Héloïse and Abelard, I thought here we go,” she says, referencing the French philosopher who had a passionate affair with a student, which led to such scandal that he was castrated, and only 1,000 years ago. “Have we not got over the idea that knowledge, and a shared enthusiasm for poetry, is…? Obviously I don’t believe in harassment and things like that,” she explains, “but we do risk a situation where anything you don’t like, or you feel is inappropriate for your group, should in some way have a limitation on it which borders on legal. I don’t quite like that. I don’t quite like the feeling that these regulations are being enforced on me. I mean, I lived through the 1960s, which was all about gaining more freedom – sexual freedom, language freedom. Religious freedom! Civil rights! Now it’s about freedom, in a sense, but, we mustn’t do this, and we mustn’t do that. It’s quite a different mindset.” She herself was sexually assaulted by a government minister when she had to take a taxi with him many years ago – she says there’s no point naming him “because everyone from back then is dead anyhow. But that’s how you lived your life, because men were making passes at you all the time. Grabbing. Pinching. Squeezing. You know… And there was no point in complaining because the men you complained to would be doing it, too. It was the water you swam in and you got used to avoiding the rocks and the sharks. You made your own way.” So she is delighted that the harassment now has to stop. “To see that go away, and to see that suddenly be so unacceptable is… how extraordinary. People are more assertive now. I sort of accepted the world as it was.” But as for consensual relationships, some might say that if a 20-year-old student chooses to have it away with a 40-year-old lecturer then that’s their business. “Absolutely! And how are you going to police it? We weren’t allowed to have sex at all when we were at university, but I got round it. I used to sleep in King’s College [men only, with her future husband Michael Bakewell] and leave a rolled blanket in my bed so that it looked as though I were asleep, in case anyone came in to check.” She had a friend who got pregnant and had to tell the principal, “and he said to her, ‘You will be on the next train out of Cambridge, you have brought disgrace.’ Of course the boy went on and took his degree; he didn’t have to leave. And the couple got married and stayed together for 60 years.” She adds: “It is very hard to legislate for emotional impulses of such power,” her spoken sentences often sounding as well put together as other people’s written ones, a skill honed in her long career of broadcasting. (I can imagine she speaks well in the House of Lords, where she says she has been enjoying the intellectual stimulation since Labour’s Ed Miliband made her a Labour peer in 2011.) “I was married at 22 and I remember thinking to myself, fine, I’m really happily married now, but does this mean I only have one female-male relationship for however many years I’m going to live? I remember thinking, that’s not going to be sustainable! Because the world is full of extremely interesting people, and bonds arise between them. I do think it’s strange, the expectation of people who stand at the altar, or wherever they make their vows, to say: ‘Till death us do part.’ I mean you’re undertaking the most amazing loyalty, but also at the exclusion of all other people on the planet from intimacy with you. And that seems not quite… balanced, somehow.” She smiles contentedly, feeling particularly good today as she has just had her first Covid vaccination and is desperate to be reunited with her children and grandchildren. “The world is full of interesting people now. Men and women,” she adds, “now that we can say that. Too interesting to just ignore.” Wait, I ask, what does she mean – that she was sexually attracted to both? “Well a lot of my female friends are married to each other. Lesbian partnerships,” she replies, with a haste that I might be imagining. “Which were unusual before, though of course they did exist, but they were in the shadows. Now they’re not in the shadows. And I’ve been to some wonderful weddings.” Of course, she didn’t stick to the one sexual relationship, as she had an affair with Harold Pinter for at least seven years, staying friends with him afterwards, even when he wrote the play, Betrayal, about their relationship, a secret she guarded for decades. She decided not to feel guilty about their affair and to enjoy it, and tells me her divorce wasn’t really about that. “No, it was far more complicated than that. I was married for 17 years the first time and 25 the second [to Jack Emery] and for something like the first 10 of the first one, and something like 15 of the second, they were very satisfying and gratifying marriages. But they did go substantially wrong and I decided it was no longer the marriage I thought.” Which is why she now lives alone, in a smaller home in Primrose Hill than the big family house down the road that she bought in the 1960s and lived in for decades, having hired a professional declutterer to help. The new place has a bedroom downstairs for her and one upstairs, ready and waiting for a future carer to live in. She has written a book about downsizing, The Tick of Two Clocks: A Tale of Moving On, due out this year, “full of gossip, how I did it and what it felt like, bit of a diary. But it’s also about adjusting your head to feeling old and all the things that you need to do. Getting rid of all the stuff is emblematic of sorting life out. So it’s a bit about facing up to the fact that this is it, this is where I shall live until I die now. This is it.” “Emotionally, how do you let yourself part with all the stuff?” I ask her. “Well, it’s really hard. I think it helps if you are getting rid of it in the interests of building something else – while you’re losing all the extra stuff. Books were the most painful – ugh, books were terrible.” Living alone during the pandemic has meant she organised a meal swap with her neighbours, the novelist Andrew O’Hagan and his wife, taking it in turns to cook dinner for each other “and running across the road with a tray of hot food” for about the first eight weeks. Then she accepted a few meals from the neighbourhood Covid support group, “but realised I had better get my act together,” she says, “and cook the things I liked that don’t make me fat.” She had to spend Christmas by herself for the first time in her life, rather than drive to her daughter Harriet’s family in Bristol as planned; she also has a son Matthew. There were family Zooms and a walk with a friend, but it was “a day like any other” in ways, and this morning she “sneaked out to have a takeaway coffee in the street” with her other neighbour, the Channel 4 news anchor Jon Snow. (Yes, Primrose Hill really is like that.) She has no respect for Boris Johnson, despite having been in a book group with his father, Stanley, for years. “I don’t approve really of Boris at all and he uses all this ‘We’ll fight it, we’ll defeat it’ language about the virus. It’s just not the right way to regard something that is around and infecting us and other people. As though there’s a side to it, and it’s the enemy and we’re the virtuous ones. When I was a child, the war was happening because someone was doing very wicked things in a place that was not far away – a place that we used to visit, as it were. The enemy was up there bombing.” She can’t stand watching the regular Covid press conferences “because I get so angry and so irritated. So I wait and let all the journos filter it so I can digest it in edible slices.” A few weeks after we spoke, Bakewell began proceedings against the government over its policy to delay the second dose of the vaccine. “I myself have been fortunate to have mine, but I am doing this on behalf of those waiting to have their second Pfizer vaccine. Older people are in limbo. They need to know whether delaying the vaccine is both safe and legal. I am bringing this case because I believe the government needs to make this clear.” She has all sorts of newspaper apps and subscriptions on her iPhone; everything from the Telegraph to the Washington Post to the New Statesman. I wonder if she would have liked a more news-based, political career – like Emily Maitlis. “Well,” she says, “I did have this wonderful break on a series called Late Night Line-Up, which had an open brief. And that was a marvellous opportunity. You let your mind rip and did daring things and met unusual people. However, as a result of all that kind of exposure – which is an appropriate word really – I got tagged, and I hope you won’t remember it, with a phrase that followed me for a couple of decades: ‘the thinking man’s crumpet’. Which did for any kind of serious Panorama-style reporting. I knew it was meant frivolously, by someone who knew I was good at my job, oh… who was that… very tall, very witty man?” Gratifyingly, she has both outlived him and forgotten his name. And seen a world in which women have been able to go so much further into news TV than she did. Is she pleased? “Oh yes!” she replies, with absolute delight in her voice, the tone shifting completely. “I mean Emily’s wonderful, isn’t she? And she isn’t the only one.” We discuss the interrogative interviewing manner of the Maitlis, Kay Burley, Naga Munchetty generation; Bakewell says she couldn’t have addressed people like that anyway. “Nobody did in the 60s and 70s, when people were still incredibly deferential. I mean, I remember the days when people said, ‘Well Prime Minister, would you like to add anything else to the interview?’ ‘No thank you,’ said the Prime Minister. And that inhibited me. So it is just wonderful what has happened.” She really admires these women who “are so self-possessed, and attractive, and entirely themselves. Who’s the girl who’s just taken over Woman’s Hour? Wonderful voice. Emma Barnett. Fantastic, she’s fantastic. I didn’t know anything about her except she’s incredibly good. She doesn’t lose her edge.” This summer she filmed a new series of Landscape Artist of the Year, mainly shot outdoors in beautiful surroundings to keep her safe from Covid (she had to take a break from doing the indoor Portrait Artist of the Year series, which she felt might be less safe for her) and admits that she has strong feelings about art. “Yes, well the judges will say I am a bit of a problem like that, haha. I do have opinions. I bite my lip before we get to the results. I don’t think I would influence them, but I don’t want to create any rancour. I quite often don’t agree with them! But it’s a lovely, expert programme that will change the way you look at paintings.” As for her personal life, I wonder if she is actually enjoying the peace and quiet. “Well,” she replies, thinking. “I have felt the absence of the other. I think one of the things I miss is the sense that there is someone else in the world who thinks that you are the most important thing in their life. I think that’s a very wonderful attribute of marriage, and I see it around me in my friends’ marriages – and in my children’s, too. That there is one other person to whom you’re attached who thinks that you are the most wonderful person in the world. And they are devoted to you. I don’t have that. And that’s nice to have, there’s no doubt about that.” We talk about people who have had long marriages. “It is a very remarkable thing, that kind of devotion,” she says. “So remarkable that they often take it for granted.” So is this it, do you think – or might you meet someone? I ask her in all seriousness. For some reason it seems the most normal thing in the world that this sprightly, engaging person, who has such a positive view towards romance and sex, might marry again. “SOPHIE! I’m in my late 80s!” She splutters, laughing so much she can barely get the words out. “I have to say,” she struggles, laughing, “I’m not looking to or expecting to. Such a strange idea,” she adds, looking at me almost in sympathy for my strange idea. “No.” Landscape Artist of the Year returns on Wednesdays at 8pm on Sky Arts (Freeview channel 11)"
"After a year of Covid-19-enforced shutdowns, the Australian film industry has entered 2021 in a strong position – with The Dry grossing almost $13m at the box office since its opening on 1 January. The Robert Connolly film – financed though Screen Australia – had the fifth-highest Australian opening day for a local film in history, and has outperformed Hollywood blockbuster Wonder Woman 1984 and animated family film The Croods: A New Age for the third weekend in a row. Another Australian film, Penguin Bloom, directed by Glendyn Ivin and starring Naomi Watts, also recorded a strong opening result, grossing $2.5m since its release six days ago. Screen Australia’s CEO Graeme Mason said the commercial success of The Dry was a heartening start to the year. “It’s one of those titles that comes along where Australians see themselves and respond incredibly well,” he said. “We have one or two of them a year and I think The Dry is definitely one of them. And it’s the first time in a very long time Australia has had the No 1 and No 2 films at the box office.” Hoyts CEO Damian Keogh said he would not be surprised if The Dry topped $18m – which would see it outperform Australian classics such as Muriel’s Wedding, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and The Man from Snowy River. Although cinemas in most states are still operating at less than full capacity, The Dry’s commercial success has not happened in spite of the pandemic, Keogh said, but partly because of it. “It’s an excellent film, but there’s definitely not as much competition as there would generally be around January, so it’s getting more screen coverage,” he said. “Because of Covid, Hollywood is holding back a lot of films at the moment, which is putting some pressure on our industry – so these great Australian movies are very welcome for us right now.” Top Gun: Maverick, Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway and the latest in the James Bond franchise No Time to Die are just some of the Hollywood blockbusters that were expected to be on Australian screens by now, but their release has been delayed as the US continues to reel from the devastating effects of the pandemic, which has infected more than 26 million Americans. The Guardian’s film reviewer Luke Buckmaster praised The Dry as a gripping and polished drama, with lead actor Eric Bana delivering a “morosely convincing” performance. Penguin Bloom, based on a true story, has received mixed reviews. Another Australian feature, Stephen Johnson’s High Ground – starring Simon Baker, Yothu Yindi’s Wityana Marika and Aaron Pedersen, and filmed in Arnhem Land and Kakadu – opens on Thursday. Australian films took $22.6m at the local box office in 2020, with The Invisible Man, which was shot in Sydney between July and September 2019, accounting for more than one third of the total. That’s less than half what locally made films made on average each year prior to the pandemic, Keogh said; they usually account for just 4% of box office earnings. Mason said Covid-19 had a “seismic impact” on the local film industry in 2020, resulting in an 18% dip in Australian expenditure on drama production across film and television. To some extent that was counterbalanced by a number of big budget overseas productions – including Marvel’s Thor: Love and Thunder and Paramount’s Shantaram – relocating to Australia as the pandemic swept though the US and Europe. “[The 18%] is not such a big drop considering everything just shut down,” Mason said. The federal government’s $50m Temporary Interruption Fund announced in June 2020 enabled 35 projects to restart, after the pandemic brought all production to an abrupt halt in March. “What it shows is that [before the shut down], we were actually on target for a record year. “I think if you look at 2020 and 2021 together, it will show both those years will end up being very strong.”"
"There is only one thing anti-corruption unit AC-12 are interested in and that’s catching bent coppers. For three series of Jed Mercurio’s tense thriller, the slipperiest of the lot was “Dot” Cottan (Craig Parkinson), a double agent for organised crime, codenamed “The Caddy”. When rumbled, he texted “Urgent exit required” to armed henchmen and went out in a hail of bullets. When his bungling led to boss Christopher Eccleston’s murder by serial stabber Robert Carlyle (how’s that for a cast?), Lorcan Cranitch’s creepy cop descended further and raped colleague DS Jane Penhaligon (Geraldine Somerville). Even after Beck died, Fitz (Robbie Coltrane) was unforgiving: “I spit on the bastard’s grave every time his name is mentioned.” In the Emmy-winning Parisian police procedural, which just concluded its eighth and final series on BBC Four, “Gilou” (Thierry Godard) was the lover and most trusted enforcer of Captain Laure Berthaud (Caroline Proust). He’d beat up suspects, snort cocaine and steal from gangsters, then give a Gallic shrug and somehow get away with it. “Springfield cops are on the take / What do you expect for the money we make?” Springfield PD’s main characteristics are incompetence, laziness and doughnut consumption, but they’re also corrupt. Evidence? They’re seen cutting deals with Fat Tony’s mob, and Wiggum’s badge has “Cash Bribes Only” written on it. Jim Broadbent had a recurring role as Del Boy’s nemesis, who bore a bitter grudge from their Peckham schooldays. “Slater the Slag” would frame anyone, even his own father. Turns out he was also the ex-husband of Del’s sweetheart, Raquel. Extra fact: Broadbent had turned down the lead role of Del. “Mackey’s not a cop,” sneered his boss. “He’s Al Capone with a badge.” He might have resembled a gym-pumped Phil Mitchell, but, thanks to an incendiary, Emmy-winning performance by Michael “Thing” Chiklis, viewers couldn’t help rooting for the thuggish leader of LAPD’s gang-busting strike team. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) idolised NYPD’s top cop. Except Gina Gershon’s motorbiking, Die Hard-loving detective was secretly the criminal mastermind behind the “Golden Gang” bank robbers. Threatened with exposure, she framed Jake and Rosa, who were jailed in the season four cliffhanger. Knitwear icon DI Sarah Lund (Sofie Gråbøl) was grumpy enough before Forbrydelsen’s second series saw her betrayed by her own work partner. The aptly named Strange (Mikael Birkkjær), an Afghan war veteran, not only turned out to be a multiple murderer but shot Lund four times to silence her. Happily she was wearing body armour beneath that signature sweater. Tak God for that. You dipstick! The two-faced lawman from the 80s teatime classic overlooked the crooked schemes of Hazzard County commissioner Boss Hogg (his brother-in-law), instead trying to pin the blame on “good ol’ boys” Bo and Luke Duke. Cue the inevitable car chase that would leave Coltrane’s squad car upside-down in a creek. Pretty much every Baltimore cop was compromised in David Simon’s drama but Rawls (John Doman) was more despicable than most. His ruthless rise to superintendent of Maryland State Police was driven by bullying and spinning of crime stats. He was also a relentless git to people’s hero Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West). "
"Europe’s cultural and creative sector has been hit harder by the coronavirus crisis than every other industry except aviation, according to a study that calls for major public and private investment to avert possibly irreparable long-term damage. According to the report, revenues in the sector – which includes TV, cinema, radio, music, publishing, video games and the performing and visual arts – plunged by 31.2% last year compared with 2019. It was hit even harder than tourism, which lost 27% of its income. Only the aviation industry, where revenue fell by 31.4%, has suffered more, say the authors of the report, commissioned by EU authors’ and creators’ rights organisations and due to be presented to the European commission on Tuesday. “Culture has become a scarce resource in Europe today and we are the worse for it,” said the French electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre, who will hand over the study. “We are learning the hard way the truly essential value of art in our society.” In 2019, before the pandemic hit, Europe’s cultural and creative sector was a fast-expanding powerhouse employing about 7.6 million people, more than twice as many as the telecoms and automotive sectors combined and 700,000 more than in 2013. Its annual turnover of €643bn (£570bn) had grown by 2.6% a year over the previous six years to represent about 4.4% of the EU’s overall GDP, said the report’s authors, the accountancy firm EY, generating a surplus for the bloc of more than €8.6bn. “What we have seen since then, however, are the dramatic consequences of shutting down literally thousands of venues,” said the study’s coordinator, Marc Lhermitte. “Culture was the first sector to suspend most of its activities, and will probably be the last to resume without restrictions.” Lhermitte said Covid shockwaves had been felt across the sector, with revenues collapsing by 90% in the performing arts and 76% in the music industry. Visual arts, books, the press, films and TV saw declines of between 20% and 40%, while only video games – whose turnover rose 9% – held up. Even sectors that seemed protected by home consumption suffered sharp falls in income, Lhermitte noted, since physical experiences – such as live performances, exhibitions and screenings – and physical sales were significant drivers of many business models and production and distribution costs had become unmanageable. An increase in digital consumption was no compensation for loss of revenues generated in physical sales and events, he said: physical sales in the music industry were down 35% but digital revenues rose only 8%, while European cinemas were estimated to have lost about 75% of their earnings. Royalties collected for authors and performers by rights organisations had fallen by 35% in 2020, the report said, meaning many would inevitably suffer a sharp fall in earnings over the next two years even if business picked up in 2021. Lhermitte said the early closure in many countries of all cinemas, theatres, music venues and museums, and the cancellation of summer festivals vital for the exposure of young artists and performers in particular, was “an absolute body-blow” that would be felt for years to come. Without an early resumption of offline production and distribution and live events, investment in new projects risks collapsing altogether, the report said, warning that even if venues did reopen soon, 46% of respondents in one recent poll said they would not feel comfortable going to a concert for several months, and 21% for several years. Meanwhile, since more than 90% of operators in the cultural and creative sector are independent authors and artists or small or medium-sized independent companies, the shift online had created “a real risk that their unbalanced relationships with global internet platforms” will jeopardise their futures. The report, which included the UK since Britain was to all intents and purposes still in the EU until 31 December, said it was vital that the EU and its member states provided public funding and encouraged private investment in the creative and cultural industries’ recovery “to an extent that reflects its weight and importance”. It must also move fast to establish a “solid legal framework” to rebuild confidence in the sector’s financial viability, it recommended. “The critical period we are going through demands truly unprecedented measures,” the report concluded. “Europe’s creative sector has never known such economic devastation in the past, and its profound after-effects will be felt throughout the coming decade.”"
"I lived in Acre Lane in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, and became a teenager on 29 November 1946. My parents had divorced and I lived with my mother and my grandfather. The house was a bit crowded, so I built a tree house in the garden, which basically became my room, my world. I built it with window frames and tarpaulin, but eventually it had a paraffin lamp, a bed and all my 78rpm records and such up there. It was about 25ft (7.6 metres) up an oak tree. After becoming quite well known in the area, it started making the papers. A mention in the Manchester Evening News led to three pages in [the postwar British tabloid] Reveille. The Daily Graphic headlined their piece “The House That Jack Built – Up a Tree!” and called me Jack Mayall throughout, which was something of a letdown. In 1970, I wrote the song Home in a Tree – on my album Memories – and all the incidents in the lyrics, throwing a sword at my friend and hitting him on the ear and such, are real incidents. My mates used to come round to hang out in the treehouse. Eventually, some of the parents started to worry what we were doing up there and put the skids on it, but I lived up there right until I got married. Boogie-woogie was my introduction to blues. When I was at junior art school, a student called Joan Pilkington played the fastest boogie on the piano that I’d ever heard, apart from on gramophone records. Then one of the school yearbooks had an article by a past student about the birth of boogie-woogie [in the US in the 20s] and I was away. We didn’t have a piano at home, so I started fooling around on the one at school. The basic boogie-woogie style is that with your left hand you have a steady repetitive pattern, a bass rhythm, and you put the right hand to it. There were three major players – Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons – who all played together. Then I got into Pinetop Smith. I bought any 78 with the word “boogie” on it. Meanwhile, I was playing piano, ukulele, harmonica, and the guitars my father [a semi-professional musician] had – always self-taught. I still don’t know how to play a scale to this day. I discovered jazz and blues at around the same time as boogie-woogie – they all felt part of the same thing. My father had a very good collection of jazz and blues 78s, so I grew up listening to them. That led to reading more about it; you’d find out who the pioneers were and so on. My mecca was a shop in Manchester called Hime & Addison, on John Dalton Street, which had a wide selection. My prized 78 had Albert Ammons’ Shout for Joy on one side of a Parlophone and Bear Cat Crawl by Meade Lux Lewis on the other. One artist would mention another artist and by then I was developing an awareness of the people whose music I liked. My big three bluesmen were Lead Belly, Brownie McGhee and Blind Lemon Jefferson, whose so-called “race records” told the story of the vile lynchings and racial injustices in the south that were a black man’s reality in the early 20th century. Not many other people I knew were all that interested in this music, but it was something I was really passionate about and then able go my own way. There was a cinema in the village and I went regularly. There was a different programme twice a week, so you were exposed to all sots of movies. Margaret Lockwood films such as The Lady Vanishes were very popular. My grandad, a butcher, had friends who had access to a lot more comics than were generally around, so I had a very good collection thanks to him. Later on, I got into Weird Tales – I bought some only last week – plus Mad magazine and Tales from the Crypt, but in the early years it was all the Dandy, the Beano and Knockout. You’d await every new issue with such excitement. I loved the cartoon characters in the Beano: Dennis the Menace, the Bash Street Kids. My other big passion was Bramhall Baths. We’d dive off the high board to show off to girls. My special dive was the “half-pint” – you’d topple into the pool, curled up, holding one ankle. The last time I did it I forgot to straighten out underwater, smashed into the shallow end and broke my nose, which didn’t impress the girls at all. When I was 18, I was called into the army for national service. The standard was two years, but the recruiting officer told me that if I signed on for an extra year I’d get extra perks and I fell for it. I knew it was a mistake almost straight away, but I spent three years posted in Korea. Everybody was the same age, so we were all in the same boat. The song One Life to Live is about it. When I was on a week’s leave in Japan, I bought my first six-string guitar. I think it was about £10. It wasn’t a known brand – just a regular hollow-body guitar – but it was the best quality you could get at that time. I took two strings off it to make it easier to play, so I was playing it as a four-string. Eventually, I had it engraved and converted it to a nine-string and I played it on a lot of my records in the 60s. I lost it – along with everything else – in a fire in 1979, but instruments have never been that important to me; they’re just the tools of the trade. It’s what you put into them that counts. Art was my favourite subject at school, and my career before music. After my two years at junior art school – no more academic drudgery! – I went to the Manchester College of Art [now the Manchester School of Art] in the days when art school was starting to be a real breeding ground for musicians. If you went to art school or enjoyed art in your school lessons, the chances were you’d be into music, too. I worked as a designer on things connected to advertising, all the while playing music at night or weekends. The art gradually took a back seat as music became my career when I was 30, but whenever I made an album I tended to design the sleeve, so it came in very handy. When I was 13 or 14, I could never have imagined being regarded as “the godfather of British blues”. You don’t think that far ahead. You just put one foot in front of the other and pursue the music that you love. That’s the way it has always been. The First Generation: 1965-1974, a 35-CD box set, is released on 29 January on Snapper Music"
"Now a full week into Joe Biden’s presidency, late-night hosts dug into the troubled premise of Biden’s inaugural call for unity. “I can see why unity would be very appealing for people right now,” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. “But for unity to work, you have to agree on what unity is. And in Washington right now, they’re not even united on that.” Noah turned to a litany of arguments from Republicans including Senators Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham and John Cornyn, as well as the Fox News host Sean Hannity, that the president wasn’t committed to “unity”, because of the looming impeachment trial against Donald Trump for inciting an attack on the Capitol, or for repealing the former president’s ban on transgender service members in the military. “This is ridiculous – apparently Republicans think that unity means the Democrats have to act like Republicans? That’s not what unity means,” Noah said.  “Unity does not mean agreement. It does not mean doing whatever the other side wants. Unity means the state of being united,” he added, flipping through a massive dictionary. “And united means … unified. Unified means … to be, uh, the same thing. And same thing means … “I’ll tell you this much,” he said. “Unity doesn’t mean you just do what the losers want. It definitely doesn’t mean that you can’t hold Trump accountable for what he did.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert recapped Biden’s first phone call with Vladimir Putin, in which he pressed the Russian president on the Kremlin’s interference in American elections and reports that Russia offered bounties in Afghanistan to kill American soldiers. “Biden talking to Putin is huge news in many ways, the biggest of which is: we know about it,” Colbert explained. Trump, by contrast, hid all details of his phone calls with Putin and destroyed his translator’s notes. “Nothing suspicious about that,” Colbert deadpanned. “It’s just like a husband saying, ‘Honey, my corporate retreat was great and nothing happened with my assistant Jennifer. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to deactivate my Instagram, burn my clothes, change my name, and get a shot of penicillin.’” In other presidential transition news, Mike Pence is reportedly “homeless” after leaving the vice-presidential residence earlier this month. “That’s how all in Mike Pence was with his delusional boss,” Colbert said. “He was so devoted to the lie that they had beaten Biden that he made no plans whatsoever on where to live. That’s like the Titanic getting rid of its lifeboats to have more hall space to paint the word ‘unsinkable’.” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee took a clear-eyed survey of the immediate Covid future: a Biden presidency does not equal a rapid recovery. “It took a year of disgraceful mismanagement to get us into this mess,” she said, “so of course it will take more than a great speech, some beautiful poetry and a Bible the size of a mini-fridge.” Bee recapped the failures of the Trump administration to even attempt a plan for vaccine distribution. “Despite having the coolest, fastest-sounding name a 12-year-old boy could think of, Trump’s Operation Warp Speed has been frustratingly slow with vaccine distribution,” with much of the burden falling to already-strained local health systems. Only 2.8 million people received their first dose by the end of 2020, far short of the goal of 20 million; supply shortages have caused some states to cancel vaccination appointments, while unpredictable shipments from the federal government have led to thousands of spoiled doses sent to the garbage. “But on the plus side, our nation’s raccoons are now totally resistant to Covid,” Bee quipped. “Look, it sucks that the Trump administration never cared enough to handle this crisis,” she concluded. “While some countries were working hard to bring new cases down to nearly zero, Trump was golfing, refusing to wear a mask and, let’s be honest, probably J-ing O.” But “at least we have an administration that finally cares and has the ability to do something about this pandemic”, she added. “And that, my friends, is something worth J-ing O for.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers continued to blast Republicans for their resistance to Trump’s impeachment for inciting insurrection. The former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, for example, told Fox News there was “no basis” for impeachment. “They beat him up before he got into office, they’re beating him up after he leaves office – I mean, at some point, I mean, give the man a break,” she said. “Yes, for once in his life, give this poor man a break,” Meyers replied sarcastically. “This poor man, who despite having bone spurs pulled himself up by his bootstraps. This man worked his way up – worked his way up! – from hardscrabble roots using just his hands. Cashed a million-dollar check from his father. Toiled long days in a dark casino and long nights inhaling wind song and glitter at Studio 54. He made it in business the hard way! By bravely cheating on his taxes and refusing to pay his contractors. “Seriously, all Trump, his entire life, all he’s had are breaks,” Meyers added. “He’s famously the dumbest man alive. He has no discernible talents or skills. If Trump weren’t born rich, he’d be the old guy working at the bowling alley who gets busted for huffing shoe spray. “It’s hard at this point to reach any conclusion other than that the Republican party is fine with what Trump did,” he concluded. After all, 45 Senate Republicans voted on Tuesday to dismiss the impeachment trial. “We just have to accept that the reason they don’t want to convict Trump for inciting an insurrection to overthrow democracy,” he added, “is they don’t care he incited an insurrection to overthrow democracy.”"
"Four years ago, as Donald Trump prepared to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, his incoming administration faced a serious hurdle: booking any big-name artist to perform at his inauguration. Several artists declined or pulled out of the event; whereas Barack Obama had Beyoncé, the Trump team eventually secured country artists Lee Greenwood and Toby Keith, whose rah-rah patriotism and jingoistic lyrics fit the bill for an agenda the New Yorker writer Andrea K Scott called “America First, Art Last”. The performances drew middling crowds (ones flatly denied by then White House press secretary Sean Spicer) dwarfed the following day by the Women’s March, which drew a bevy of A-list stars to protest the Maga president. The combative, mutually bitter relationship between Trump and most artists and creative organizations has only deepened since. Though the Trump administration – called a “worst-case scenario” for arts groups – has largely failed to dismantle the federal arts programs it promised to defund, the Trump White House has been largely hostile to the arts, from Hollywood stars to political comedy down to local arts programs in cities, towns and rural areas across the country. Support of the arts, broadly construed, has understandably not been at the forefront of a rancorous and bruising 2020 election, as the economic crisis and ongoing pandemic imperil everything. But with Joe Biden’s election win, however unacknowledged by the current president, it’s worth looking ahead: what would a Biden administration mean for the arts? First and foremost, handling the coronavirus pandemic which has grounded most live performances to a halt, shuttered Broadway and theaters across the country, and tipped millions into unemployment. The Covid recession is the most unequal in modern American history, ensnaring society’s most vulnerable – including all but the biggest name artists – in prolonged, stagnating financial hardship. Without coronavirus under control, most efforts to resuscitate art economies are for nil. Once in office, Biden will undoubtedly call a cease-fire on executive attempts to destroy the cornerstones of federal arts programs: the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), long a target of the conservative culture wars since the late 1980s, and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), which supply funds to programs and institutions ranging from the Met, to regional theaters, to art classes for rural preschools. For four straight years, the Trump administration proposed budgets that would eliminate the NEA and NEH; the 2021 proposal, titled “Stopping Wasteful and Unnecessary Spending” and released in February of this year, included both agencies under a subsection called “Eliminating Programs with No Proper Federal Role” with programs “not considered core federal responsibilities.” The NEA’s $162m budget in 2019 was a mere 0.0034% of the federal expenditure, about 49 cents per capita; Trump’s budget added $4.8tn to the military budget and $2bn to his largely symbolic border wall. The worst-case scenario never came to pass – Congress soundly rejected Trump’s wrecking-ball budgets each year, as public funding for arts programs remains one of the few olive branches left on Capitol Hill, in part because the agencies fund local arts ventures in all 50 states. But the unrelenting pressure to argue for its existence in a hostile financial environment wasted time and taxpayer dollars, and conditioned state and local arts organizations already operating on the edge of solvency to even more corrosive financial uncertainty. And though Congress actually increased funding for the NEA and NEH by $2.2m last year, it’s only creeping up to levels of support enjoyed 25 years ago. More broadly, Trump fostered a White House and cult of personality hostile to artists not explicitly loyal to him, which in turned fueled a cycle of symbolic protest – ribs at the president in Oscar acceptance speeches, the ceaseless Trump focus of late-night comedy – that chained attention to the President’s Twitter-addled, pettily unfocused brain. The enmity by conservative news such as Fox News for creative expression, especially from artists of color – think outcry over Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s gloriously filthy song WAP, or manufactured outrage over the Netflix film Cuties – found a receptive and vocal audience in the president. The removal of Trump from office is unlikely to stop the rightwing media apparatus, on-air and online; under Biden, Fox News will continue to Fox News, but without the amplification of the White House. Though Biden has not been particularly known as an arts aficionado like the late supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who regularly attended operas, he is generally considered favorable to art and artists (and a reliable backer of dad-favorites, from his Beatles and Bruce Springsteen summer playlist to his favorite film, Chariots of Fire). As a senator from Delaware, Biden consistently supported arts funding and voted for legislation favored by arts executives: co-sponsored a bill creating the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, and co-sponsored legislation that founded the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2001. As Obama’s vice-president, Biden was the lead White House negotiator for the 2009 stimulus bill that supplied $50m for the arts in response to the global financial crisis. The Biden transition team has not yet announced a formal platform for the arts, but unlike the Trump administration, they are at least likely to have one. Obama was the first president to release a presidential platform for the arts, which included increased funding for the NEA, attracting “foreign talent” with a streamlined visa process, affordable healthcare for artists and development of public-private art partnerships through federal grants. Should he need to call on star power, Biden will have access to far more mega-wattage than Trump’s roster of Lil Pump and Kid Rock. As a candidate, Biden garnered endorsements from such high-profile names as Taylor Swift, Cardi B, Brad Pitt, Lady Gaga (whom he introduced at the 2016 Oscars), Bruce Springsteen and Billie Eilish. Biden’s White House is likely to resemble Obama’s in its celebrity symbiosis: a revolving door of who’s-whos and incubation of talent. (The smash Broadway hit Hamilton, for example, began as an experiment by Lin-Manuel Miranda at a 2009 White House evening for poetry, music and spoken word, and developed into the stage show thanks in part to an NEA grant.) Biden’s least quantifiable but perhaps greatest divergence from the Trump era, however, is the unshackling of attention from a single president on to … anything or anyone else. Though protest art, from Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman to collages built from the testimonies of separated migrant children, has flourished under the Trump presidency, a relatively stable figure in the White House – not to mention the nation’s first black, south Asian, or female vice-president in Kamala Harris – relieves some pressure from artists to “respond to the current moment”. Without Trump’s oxygen-sucking presence in Washington, so the thinking goes, artists are untethered from a reactive cycle, of responding explicitly or in escape to the horrors of, say, family separation, or “very fine people on both sides”. How will culture flourish when not buffeted by the demands of attention, “resistance”, exhaustion? One new (old, white) man in the White House does not, of course, change everything, nor relieve the immediate and extreme pressures – the pandemic, climate emergency – facing the country and shaping its art. But Biden’s presidency will, at least, offer breathing room and an orientation forward, rather than the distracted present or mythical past. As the president-elect himself put it in an interview with Miranda this August, in a tone unfamiliar to the Trump ethos: “The future of who we are lies in the arts. It is the expression of our soul.”"
"With the Senate’s acquittal of Donald Trump this weekend for his role in the siege of the US Capitol on 6 January, Republicans played, with the exception of seven senators, to Trump’s still-powerful party base. Yet some GOP members attempted to have their moral cake and eat it too; the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, “tried to have it both ways this weekend”, said Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday evening. “After voting to acquit, McConnell gave a blistering speech condemning Trump’s actions and inaction.” The address, in which McConnell cast Trump as responsible for the riot but acquitted him on the basis of Trump no longer being president (McConnell, as then Senate majority leader, delayed the trial until Trump left office) was “basically saying, ‘Donald Trump is guilty of all the things I just found him not guilty of,’” Kimmel explained. “It was the tortoise versus the crazy yellow hair.” The former president, ever sensitive to a slight, blasted his longtime political ally with a harsh statement. “The Republican party can never again be respected or strong with political ‘leaders’ like Senator Mitch McConnell at its helm,” he said, adding, “Mitch is a dour, sullen and unsmiling political hack, and if Republican senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again.” “Yeah, unsmiling,” Kimmel laughed. “Has Donald Trump met his wife? Melania hasn’t smiled since like 2011.” “I have to say, I think Mitch McConnell blew it,” Kimmel continued. “This was his party’s best chance to make sure Trump never ran again. Remember the end of Lord of the Rings, when Frodo brought the ring all the way to the volcano and then decided not to throw it in? This was the dumb version of that.” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah delved into the polar vortex which has paralyzed Texas and left millions without power, heat or access to food. Noah played footage showing the chaos in the storm’s wake – cars piled on the highway, one man dodging a vehicle felled by black ice just moments before it struck his own. “Trucks spinning around? Cars flying off the road? This storm has turned Texas into that ice level from MarioKart,” Noah joked. “If I was in Texas right now, I’d be carrying a green shell with me just to be safe.” “This is especially tough for Texans because they’re not equipped for snow,” he continued. “They don’t have snow shovels out there! Their best bet is to grab their AR-15s and shoot each snowflake before it lands.” The extreme cold in the southern state “just goes to show you that with climate change, everyone has to be prepared for every kind of condition, no matter where you live,” he added. “You live in Arizona? Well, you better get a parka. Minnesota? You need a big sun hat. New York? You start carrying around an anti-scorpion spray.” Still, Noah acknowledged, the blackouts in the state are no laughing matter, especially as it was the predictable outcome from years of underinvestment in and neglect of the state’s power grid. “Look, guys, I get it: spending money on infrastructure is probably the least sexy thing that you can do with your tax dollars,” he said. “But it’s one of those things you’re going to take for granted until you’re in an emergency. “It’s the same way how the people who built the Titanic didn’t focus on life boats. Instead, they were too focused on getting cars for their passengers to bang in.”"
"The last time two women did this list, they split it into two halves and said while they are both girls, they are not the same. Well, Naomi Higgins and Humyara Mahbub are both girls and we’re exactly the same. We refuse to be separated from the comforting monolith of girlhood. If you like these videos, you’re a girl too. Welcome. Mark Samual Bonanno, pictured above, is a boy and has been silenced for this article. The three of us recently created and wrote a sitcom called Why Are You Like This and the whole thing is up on ABC iView right now (and coming to Netflix for the rest of the world soon). This is our favourite TikTok account. We almost got into a fist fight trying to decide which of her videos we were going to choose. Luckily we are separated by state border restrictions at the moment. Nosebleed Fitz really speaks to us by way of being somehow chaotic, aggressive and nonchalant all at once. She also has a lot of great videos of her dancing to Church Bells by Carrie Underwood that are Actual Art. She’s just really funny!!!! It’s rare that a tweet is so correct and incorrect at the same time. Tyler, the Creator is somehow right … but also, completely missing the point here. Naomi is a regular panellist on a show called Gamey Gamey Game, which is where comedians go to talk about games … but more often than not, the game in question gets discussed for about two minutes. In this clip, comedian and writer Kate Dehnert tells a story about a pair of pants she wore yesterday. It is impossible to get across how funny it is without just watching the clip. She is so, so funny and we love her so much. Our friend Tom Walker commissioned artist Goblin Snacks to do these drawings of us to celebrate the show coming out. This is funny in the way when you are silent for a time and then you scream, which is a kind of laughing. This tweet is relevant to us due to our agonies. We are lucky to be tangentially associated with the only non-problematic group of straight white men in comedy. This video from Aunty Donna features Mark Samual Bonanno, who is the third co-creator and writer of our show. The thing about this video is that it is a documentary and not exaggerated in any way. Mark is like this. Here we have some girls turning a trope on its head to the point of being offensive. This is incredibly in keeping with the TV show we wrote, and also all of the things we were gently told would probably make a lot of people angry if we kept them in the script. We changed … some of them. Again, we could not decide which Gabriel Gundacker video to post, but Naomi got to choose the twilight one so Hum wins here. It’s amazing how many ways Gabriel can say he went to the Coinstar and it wasn’t working. He tweaks it until it feels like a cohesive bit which is a great case study for comedy being meaningless and stupid. It is from here that we would like to put a case forward for standup comedians to not have any rights. One brilliant thing about the internet is how art iterates on itself until it is inscrutable to an outside observer. There is a TikTok format called “put a finger down”, kind of like never-have-I-ever, where you put a finger down if you relate to what they’re saying. Fast-forward until you have this, a grotesque distortion of a video about ~relatable brunette things~. We found this tweet about our show and it made us laugh a lot. If you too are feeling this way, our advice is this: Hahahahahahahaha How The Fuck Is Hating Our Show Real Hahahaha Just Walk Away From The Screen Like Close Your Eyes Haha."
"Australian arts and cultural organisations and venues are scrambling to plead their case with Facebook to have their sites restored after they were caught up in the social media giant’s blanket ban on publishing news. More than 250 cultural organisations woke on Thursday to find their Facebook pages had been wiped of content. They argue they do not meet the social media giant’s loose definition of “news publisher” under the ban, which swept the site of news and news-related links this week. Many still had not had their sites restored by midday on Friday, with Facebook requiring organisations to appeal its decision by filling out an online form and awaiting the outcome. The Fremantle Arts Centre, which usually fields traffic of more than 10,000 visits a day on its Facebook page, was down for 24 hours just as it was preparing Friday’s opening night exhibition, A Forest of Hooks and Nails, as part of Perth festival. “It has significantly disrupted events that are happening at the centre,” a Fremantle Arts Centre spokesperson told Guardian Australia. “Facebook is our primary communication channel outside of our own website so it has had a significant impact.” Among the arts organisations still without operational Facebook sites on Friday were many who would appear to fail to meet the broadest definition of news publisher, including the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, Bangarra Dance Theatre, Bell Shakespeare, the Art Gallery of Ballarat, Black Swan State Theatre Company, La Mama and Opera Queensland. Venues such as Sydney’s Carriageworks and the Brisbane Multicultural Arts Centre remained without a social media platform to promote their works on Friday, and a slew of arts publishing sites, including ArtsHub, Artlink magazine, Australian Arts Review and Audrey Journal, and literary magazines were also hit. As the country’s peak performing arts body, Live Performance Australia was giving evidence at a federal government into creative and cultural industries during Covid-19 in Canberra on Friday, its Facebook site remained unoperational. Australia’s largest online bookseller, Booktopia, which had approximately 130,000 followers on Facebook, has also been captured under the ban. “We’ve heard absolutely nothing from Facebook,” said Booktopia’s head of marketing, Steffen Daleng. “We’ve been introduced by other people in our network to a page on Facebook’s help page, it talks about what people can do to circumvent the ban. It seems to require us to remove any old posts that that might link to news, but that’s an insurmountable task for companies like ours. “We have a production team, a production studio, we’ve put significant investment into producing and creating unique content on Facebook. [The site] contains thousands of author interviews.” Elliott Bledsoe, who runs a boutique communication consultancy for arts organisations, Agentry, began collecting the names of cultural bodies who had their sites wiped by Facebook on Thursday. By Friday morning, more than 270 were on his list, although some have since become operational again. “I know that a lot of organisations that wouldn’t know how to handle this issue, they’re not overly familiar with the process of reporting an issue to Facebook and providing the right evidence, like screenshots [to appeal the ban],” Bledsoe said. “For a lot of smaller organisations, this probably wasn’t even on their radar. They wouldn’t have even anticipated the idea that they would get caught up in the rollout of the news block on Facebook.” The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA), the union which covers artists, arts workers and performers as well as journalists, described Facebook’s extreme reaction to the Australian government’s move to force the social media platform to pay for news content as “the desperate act of a company with too much power that thinks it is beyond the reach of any government”. “This move by Facebook, which has refused to negotiate as recommended by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, will only lead to its audience being denied reliable, factual news and will inflict massive reputational damage for its brand,” said MEAA media section federal president Marcus Strom. “Unlike Google, which has sensibly begun negotiating content agreements with publishers and broadcasters, Facebook has abused its dominant position and is holding Australian news agencies, advertisers and consumers to ransom with this cowardly response.” Guardian Australia has approached Facebook for comment."
"If you’re looking for a salve or an escape in your bingeable TV, look further than Veep. Don’t even think about hitting play. Get as far as you can from this show, a seven-season odyssey of human cruelty, pettiness, and political horror. You won’t find escapism in this tale of the United States’ first female vice-president – just the savage and brutally funny, the mean, the insane and the inane. Starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Veep is a show with little-to-no faith in the political system, which sees a climate of backflipping, false promises, and nothing-speak as the structures of government working effectively. Created by the political comedy pessimist Armando Iannucci as an American analogue to his cult British comedy The Thick of It, Veep views 99% of elected officials as ruthless, power-hungry loons, and the other 1% as rubes. Better than pretty much any other show about systems of institutional power, it demonstrates how politicians from both sides of the aisle are, more often than not, willing to dilute and diminish their “beliefs” in order to maintain their own power. It’s farcical, sure, but it’s not exactly satire – everything rings far too true for that. Set roughly in real time and beginning in 2012, Veep follows the political trajectory of Louis-Dreyfus’ Selina Meyer, a Baltimore Democrat and senator turned presidential candidate turned vice-president. At the beginning of the series, she is powerless and frustrated, neutered by a position that carries more symbolic power than any real authority or autonomy. It is a bad role for Selina, who is, at turns, petty, childish, self-absorbed, cruel, authoritarian, and stupid. She is teeth-gnashingly, mouth-foamingly desperate for any semblance of power, and uses any opportunity she can to assert her dominance over others, most notably the low-level incompetent team around her: highly-strung, callous chief of staff Amy (Anna Chlumsky), sleazy strategist Dan (Reid Scott), bumbling communications officer Mike (Matt Walsh), and bag man Gary (Tony Hale). Selina is a psychotic marvel of a creation by Iannucci and Louis-Dreyfus, the latter of whom tears into the role with career-defining vigour, and who won a record-breaking six Emmy awards for it over the course of the show. At the beginning of the series, Selina and her team are portrayed as nasty and socially incompetent, but largely harmless – bureaucratic goons who are too self-absorbed to do any real harm. Around halfway through the series, though, a shift occurs. Iannucci departed Veep at the end of season four, passing the reins to David Mandel, most well-known as a writer for Seinfeld. The difference in tone is stunning: Mandel, an American, casts a sharper, more vicious eye over US politics. In the show’s final seasons, Selina becomes an icon of deft, horrifying cruelty, a political agent with no driving forces other than her lust for more power and her hatred for women and working-class people. In its most breathtaking and canny sweeps, we see Selina leveraging identity markers like her womanhood while actively pushing to diminish the rights of non-rich and non-white women. In its final three seasons, Veep becomes a terrifying beast, a morality tale with operatic beats that also happens to be hysterically funny. Its ending is bleak, unflinching, and decidedly brilliant –a meditation on the inherent corruption of power that pulls no punches, comically or emotionally."
"New South Wales’ largest cultural capital works project since the Sydney Opera House will go ahead at a cost of at least $950m, with the state government finally approving the Powerhouse Parramatta museum after a five-year controversy. But the project is contingent upon the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences – better known as the Powerhouse Museum in Ultimo – raising $75m of the total cost from philanthropic donations. Planning minister, Rob Stokes, and arts minister, Don Harwin, announced the green light for the museum late on Friday, three days before a parliamentary inquiry into the government’s management of museums and other cultural institutions was scheduled to hold its fifth hearing. Giving evidence at that inquiry on Monday, Harwin said he was “entirely comfortable” with the progress the museum’s campaign team, established in November 2019, had made in raising donations for the now approved project. Greens MP, David Shoebridge, asked Harwin how much of the $75m had so far been secured after a year and a half of fundraising. “None of it’s in the bank yet but they’re making excellent progress,” Harwin said. Shoebridge replied: “You have to get $75 million. You haven’t got one single cent, how can you say that’s going well?” Harwin said the NSW government had a solid track record in raising philanthropic funds for cultural projects. “When we say we are going to do this, we will do this,” the arts minister said. “And when I say that I am comfortable with the progress that’s being made I know what I’m talking about. I have every reason to be confident about how that is going.” The Powerhouse Museum’s executive director, Lisa Havilah, told the inquiry the drive for donations was “on track”. “You haven’t received one dollar. And how is that on track?” Shoebridge asked her. “We’ve made very significant progress and that progress is confidential until the government and the trust are ready to make an announcement about it,” Havilah responded. Harwin told the inquiry Powerhouse Parramatta would inject “hundreds of millions of dollars” into western Sydney’s economy and create 4,000 jobs. He dismissed allegations from Shoebridge and Labor MP, Walt Secord, that the 188 conditions placed on the planning consent could cause the total cost of the project to blow out to $1.5b. Among the conditions is the still un-costed plan to dismantle the Victorian Italianate mansion, Willow Grove, on the proposed museum site and reassemble it elsewhere in Parramatta, in what Shoebridge described as a “Las Vegas-style” copy of the original. Harwin said the historic mansion would be “sensitively” demolished and rebuilt, but he would not be drawn on the cost of the relocation project. The secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union NSW, Darren Greenfield, told the inquiry that as long as the NSW government adhered to its plans to demolish Willow Grove, the union’s green ban would remain, effectively preventing any construction on the new museum. The CFMEU placed the green ban on the project in November last year, in support of the traditional owners of the land, the Dharug people, who say Willow Grove and the land it sits on hold deep cultural significance for the local Indigenous community. “The Dharug people [place] a lot of value in the land itself out there,” Greenfield said. “To remove the house you remove everything … it’s the property, the house, the trees, it means a lot to them and to the community.” Greenfield said the three construction companies shortlisted by the NSW government to construct the museum all operated under CFMEU enterprise bargaining agreements and the union’s members would adhere to the green ban. Havilah told the inquiry work on the museum site began at 7.30am on Monday. Protest signs and memorabilia, including photographs of babies born at Willow Grove during its time as a maternity hospital in the 20th century, were removed from the site in recent days. The new museum’s site, on the flood-prone banks of Parramatta River, was problematic from an environmental as well as cultural and heritage perspective, the inquiry heard. Giving evidence on Monday, natural hazards consultant, Steven Molino, said while modifications to the Moreau Kusunoki and Genton design had largely mitigated the risk of loss of life in the event of flooding, there was still a 12% chance of the museum’s priceless collection being damaged by flood water in the presumed 100-year lifespan of the building."
"“I don’t really know what I’m doing,” lies Riz Ahmed at the start of this virtuosic display of his considerable talents. Part music video, part call to arms, this event for Manchester international festival and Brooklyn academy of music follows on from last year’s album of the same name, which likened the UK’s increasing hostility to immigrants to an abusive relationship, and an accompanying short film that envisaged a shocking near-future reality. Originally broadcast last December from a deserted and supposedly haunted San Francisco theatre, the performance begins with an illusion of spontaneity – Ahmed sharing his pre-show backstage rituals – but gradually reveals a carefully choreographed mix of spoken-word poetry, storytelling and striking visuals accompanied by thrilling hip-hop beats, including a hard-hitting rendition of album highlight Toba Tek Singh. Ahmed is a magnetic presence: his prodigious wordplay and rapping prowess combine in a high-octane performance brimming with righteous anger that brings to mind Childish Gambino’s This Is America. Starting with the disturbing implications behind the question “Where are you really from?”, Ahmed dissects themes of home and belonging, the toxic legacy of empire and Covid’s devastating effect on communities of colour (“killed by corona or the crown, different track, same dance”). The ideas come thick and fast, from his ancestors’ contributions to British society – tea, the paisley pattern, even swastikas – to reflections about his relatives’ personal experience: a candlelit section about his grandfather being forced to leave India in 1947 is chilling. All the while, Ahmed questions his own artistic process, the role of the audience (the aim is not, he says, to “entertain you with our tragedies”) and the powerlessness of words in bringing about change. Whether the bleak future he predicts will come to pass or not is still to be seen. But for now, this is the kind of raw, affecting work that can guide us in the right direction. "
"When the global lockdown began last March, many of us made a lofty list of personal development goals: learn French, get a six-pack, read the collected work of Dostoevsky. There’s little evidence to suggest we followed through on the first two fronts but in the latter we have been surprisingly successful: Australians are reading more than ever. Booktopia, Australia’s largest online retailer of books, reported its best year on record with a 28% increase in new book sales; and Allen & Unwin, Australia’s biggest independent publisher, enjoyed an increase of 34% between May 2019 and May 2020. A research report from the GlobalWebIndex says Australians’ reading rates are up 20% because of Covid-19. And among the winners of this literary resurgence is a micro-industry: book subscription services, which curate a selection for you and deliver them to your home. In an era of information overload and a crowded literary market with an often debilitating degree of choice, it isn’t hard to see the attraction of professionals highly attuned to the market – or algorithms catered to your tastes – making the decisions for you. Meg Stacey and Marissa Piazza, lawyer friends from Melbourne who bonded over their love of reading, launched Literati Book Club in August 2020, and have doubled their customer base every month since. “We started to think about how we could facilitate a community that would bring people together during a really difficult time,” Piazza says. Literati offers monthly book deliveries in the categories of non-fiction, new fiction, and classic literature – or, for the particularly ambitious, a combination of all three to the tune of $87 a month – as well as access to interactive reader Q&As with authors, facilitated over Zoom with writers including Trent Dalton, Rumaan Alam and Victoria Hannan. Nick Mackay, a Melbourne-based freelance digital designer, launched Bionic Book Subscription in July, having spent the first couple of months of lockdown working on an algorithm that would use readers’ personal preferences to determine which book they would be sent each month. “I thought it would be too hard to compete with the big book selling companies like Amazon,” Mackay says. “We wanted to offer a service that mirrored the way music streaming services like Spotify use your personal taste to inform what you listen to.” Mackay believes his customers have picked up long-term reading habits – subscriptions are continuing to grow, even as many Australian cities enjoy life post-lockdown. “From our first month, we grew an average of 112% in sales per month until the end of 2020,” he says. “The last three months of the year were our biggest period of growth.” On New South Wales’ south coast Laura Brading – who previously worked in publishing at HarperCollins and worked as a bookseller – found runaway success with WellRead: a curated subscription service with monthly picks dictated by Brading’s own tastes. WellRead launched in late 2019 but really took off in May 2020, with subscriptions tripling since the pandemic, and Brading sending out more than 750 books each month. “There’s so much decision fatigue nowadays, and I really do believe that there’s nothing as valuable as a well-read person who can really curate and help you find your next read,” she says. Longer-established services are reaping the rewards too. Bookabuy – one of Australia’s largest book subscription services – had its “biggest revenue year since starting the business” in 2020, according to a founder, Chris Tantchev. Angie Reader, a founder of the NovelTea Book Club – the Melbourne-based service which pairs new fiction releases with high-end tea sets – says from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020, it more than doubled subscribers. Perhaps the drive for a curated reading list has to do with this current cultural moment, too: reading has taken on a somewhat performative aspect on social media, where tablescaped book stacks and micro-reviews flood feeds in what Brading calls a kind of “intellectual virtue signalling”. Perceived literary nous is seen to add a certain level of prestige to a medium often maligned for being shallow and superficial (in the last 12 months everyone from the Duchess of Cornwall to Kaia Gerber have launched Instagram book clubs, for example). In that sense, subscription services also offer a money-can’t-buy service – cultural credibility. A more jaded person might decry a generation who will only pick up a book when it is delivered to their door – but when, like this author, you’ve already dabbled with a slew of subscriptions – fitness apps, food delivery and even, briefly, natural wine – services that promote and encourage reading seem as sensible an investment as any."
"Somehow, I managed to make it to adulthood without seeing the Scream movies. Well, kind of. There are certain films and TV series that, even if you try and avoid them, still seep into the social consciousness – and, by extension, into your brain. I’ve never sat down and watched an episode of Seinfeld and yet somehow I know all of the characters’ names, and that one of them eats chocolate bars with a knife and fork. Friends who have never seen Forrest Gump still know that, apparently, “life is like a box of chocolates” – and when I finally sat down to watch The Princess Bride I spent most of the time going, “Oh, so that’s where memes come from.” I thought I knew what Scream was all about. Without trying, I’d managed to somehow see the opening scene – where Drew Barrymore’s character answers the phone while cooking popcorn on the stove – what felt like 20 times. I knew that the main villain wore a long, warped ghost mask and black robes. Vaguely I was aware that in the second movie someone gets killed in a cinema. In my mind it was a classic series of teen slasher films, much like the I Know What You Did Last Summer series: 90s, gory, and full of heart-throbs and jump scares in equal measure. And so I decided to give it a miss. This, it turned out, was a mistake. Wes Craven’s Scream films are horror, sure, but they’re also darkly funny, and an extremely meta exploration of the horror film genre, the zeitgeist and themselves. The Scream films centre around Sidney Prescott, played by Neve Campbell. In the first film she is still recovering from the shock of her mother’s murder one year earlier. The man who did it is in jail but then, almost one year to the day, a series of killings begin in her town. In classic slasher style, there are red herrings and paranoia and a whole lot of really creative and unlikely deaths – the difference is how aware of the genre tropes the characters are. Even in the opening scene, the doomed Drew Barrymore character is asked what her favourite scary movie is – and as the tension amps up, the resident film geek starts to lay out exactly who would be the killer or what would happen next if this were a horror movie. And yet, even armed with this knowledge, the murders continue. The second film gets even more meta – it’s set around the release of a film, based on a book written about the murders that happened in the first film. It kicks off with a much-spoofed scene where a young couple go to watch the new “Stab” movie at a cinema, where you watch them as they watch a dramatised version of the opening scene of the original Scream movie. It’s like a photocopy of a picture of a mirror looking into a mirror. By the time you get to Scream 3, the characters who have survived the first two movies feel like old friends – which is why when the rules of a trilogy are laid out, which bluntly state that all bets are off and anyone could die, things feel just as stressful as they did in the first film. Even though the gore does get less intense across the three films, they are still quite bloody – so if you are really not a fan, then keep on giving it a miss. However, much like The Cabin in the Woods, for me the humour, the meta commentary and the overall silliness of it all was enough to balance it out and make the “scary” elements not really scary at all. They’re films you can enjoy on a number of levels. They work as slasher movies. They work as commentary on slasher movies. Despite the murders, they are strangely comforting. You can watch one in 20-minute increments over a week. You can turn out all the lights and immerse yourself completely. You can put them on in the background while doing your tax or baking cookies. They’re also just a wonderful time capsule of the 90s. From continuing roles to brief cameos, it’s pretty much a who’s who of actors at the time, with performances by Courtney Cox, Liev Schreiber, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Arquette, Omar Epps, Joshua Jackson, Matthew Lillard, Skeet Ulrich and Patrick Dempsey. I realise the fact that the Scream series is actually very good is not a revelation to those who watched the films as they came out, but the thing I’ve learned in the time since I finally binged the first three movies (there’s a fourth one, but I haven’t found a way to legally watch it) is that they also don’t get old. If you haven’t watched them before, now is the time. If you have watched them before, it’s time to revisit. And if you did a rewatch last week – do another one tonight."
"I was first introduced to Utopia on a visit home to the UK in 2013. Not to be confused with Working Dog’s well-loved, deadpan infrastructure sitcom, this Utopia is Dennis Kelly’s weird, dark and idiosyncratic conspiracy thriller. I was hooked from the opening sequence. Over the course of three days, I binged the entire first season and was blown away. Utopia is one of the most powerful and electrifying pieces of television I’ve seen. At the time of that first watch, I duly expected it to feature on “best of TV” lists for years to come, alongside the likes of The Wire, Breaking Bad or The Sopranos, of which Utopia is more than an equal. It was quite a surprise then to learn that Utopia existed only as a cult hit (albeit one with fervent fans), was dismissed from its home on the UK’s Channel 4 after only two seasons, and remains criminally underseen almost everywhere else, including in Australia. The plot revolves around a mysterious unpublished graphic novel – the sequel to a popular first chapter – and a group of people brought together by their shared obsession with it, and its apparently prophetic scientist author, now dead. As the four new friends – Becky (Alexandra Roach), Ian (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), Grant (Oliver Woollford) and the magnificently named Wilson Wilson (Adeel Akhtar) – get closer to the manuscript, they discover more about the dangerous secrets it contains, including details of a shadowy black ops organisation called the Network and the true identity of its founder, known only as Mr Rabbit. Oh, and it also contains details of a chemical compound that world governments and the Network will stop at nothing to obtain. The closer the group gets to the truth, the more their lives begin to unravel. They become embroiled in a global conspiracy centred around a vaccine in a pandemic; they are framed for crimes they did not commit; they are hunted by everyone. Loyalties are divided, morals compromised and there’s a good old fashioned double cross or two. Their only hope of survival is to go on the run with an infamous terrorist named Jessica Hyde (Fiona O’Shaughnessy). From top to bottom, Utopia challenges you. It’s like a paranoid conspiracy thriller from the 1970s transported to middle England. A global conspiracy, with reality-fracturing consequences, playing out against mundane British suburbia – it’s a striking juxtaposition, making Utopia both outlandish and believable at the same time. Another intriguing facet to Utopia is the ethical dilemma it presents to its characters – and to the viewer. As details of the conspiracy unfold, we start to wonder if the bad guys actually have a point. Their methods are abhorrent but perhaps some of their thinking is sound? Our protagonists must decide on which side of the fence they stand, and we find ourselves in their shoes, asking the same questions. There’s no doubt Utopia goes down some dark paths, particularly when we meet the two matter-of-fact hitmen, Arby and Lee (Neil Maskell and Paul Ready), who are sent after the group. Arby looks like a geezer down the pub, while Lee could be mistaken for a real estate agent, but they both throw violence around casually, almost cartoonishly, taking a monstrously placid approach to the task at hand. The consequence is some of the most well-performed and unsettling horror sequences of the past two decades. But there is also a warped vein of comedy about these killers, and in keeping with Utopia’s refusal to depict anything in black and white terms, the writers even manage to generate some sympathy for Arby later in the piece. This ever-present gallows humour lightens Utopia’s emotional load. Combined with Cristobal Tapia de Veer’s strange, discombobulating soundtrack, and a colour palette taking in blue skies and golden fields and weird green interrogation rooms, the whole series presents itself as slightly off-kilter, and this unique aesthetic buffs away some of the show’s sharper edges. Quite why Utopia was so overlooked is a bit of mystery. Darkness aside, perhaps it was ahead of its time. Perhaps what Utopia really needed was today’s deranged political climate and a terrifying real-life virus in order to thrive because themes of global extinction, shadowy corporate overlords and conspiracy theories feel perfectly suited to 2020. We’ll probably find out soon enough, as Amazon Prime’s US remake, penned by Gone Girl’s Gillian Flynn, has just hit the platform. With any luck it will renew interest in the original, because it’s just as enthralling now as it when it first aired. Utopia is dark, weird, unique and densely plotted. In other words, it’s the perfect show for lockdown rediscovery."
"Australian music promotion legend Michael Gudinski has died suddenly at the age of 68. Tributes began pouring in on social media on Tuesday morning for the Mushroom Records and Frontier Touring co-founder, who died in Melbourne on Monday night, according to a statement released by the company. Among those paying tribute on Tuesday were Bruce Springsteen, who tweeted that Gudinski was “first, last and always a music man” who was “deeply soulful”. For five decades Gudinski championed Australian acts, including Skyhooks, Kylie Minogue, New Zealand-born Split Enz and more recently, Eskimo Joe and Evermore. He also brought to Australia many of the world’s top artists, including Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, the Police and more recently, Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift. When Covid-19 shut down the music industry in 2020, Gudinski launched the online Live music series The State of Music, in support of local musicians who lost their livelihoods overnight. The series became the ABC TV show The Sound. Gudinski collected a number of Aria swards over the years including the special achievement award in 1992. In 2013 he was acknowledged as the inaugural Aria industry icon. In 2006 he was made a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia. The Music Network described the Melbourne-based entrepreneur as a “high-energy, relentless businessman, who drove his passion for music” through his Mushroom Group ventures. “Mushroom ran into financial problems many times as some of its acts failed to get commercial airplay,” the network’s contributing author Christie Eliezer wrote. “Each time one act – whether Skyhooks, Kylie Minogue, Split Enz or Jimmy Barnes – would come up with blockbusters that kept the label afloat so he could sign more alternative acts.” Music Victoria said Gudinski would be greatly missed and had left an enduring legacy. Musician Ben Lee described him as “a force of nature”. Actor Russell Crowe hailed the promoter as “a towering figure on the Australian cultural landscape”. “I’m not sure we ever agreed on anything, except maybe @edsheeran,” he tweeted on Tuesday. “Still didn’t stop us from being mates for 30 years. I’m going to miss him deeply.” Entertainment business Teg released a statement paying tribute to Gudinski, saying: “Michael was a larger-than-life character whose legacy in Australian music is undeniable.”"
"Stepping into a venue full of sweaty strangers is still a frustratingly distant prospect, so as live music IRL continues to be benched, our only option is to dig into the giddy world of concert albums. Where better to start than with Daft Punk’s relentlessly pumping Parisian electronica party, complete with unbridled whoops of glee and synth singalongs from a rightly jazzed home-town crowd. It’s now tinged with an added wistfulness following this week’s announcement that the pair have split up after 28 years. There’s edgy and then there’s playing a song called Cocaine Blues to a room full of hootin’ and hollerin’ convicts. Some 13 years after he recorded Folsom Prison Blues, Johnny Cash finally rocked up at the song’s California namesake, and to possibly the most appreciative crowd of his career. You’re in a Greenwich Village jazz bar, dressed like a Queen’s Gambit extra, sipping on a dirty martini and wondering how far the opening act, a young comic called Richard Pryor, might go. Then Nina Simone’s vocals drift out over soul-smacking piano, mixing Nigerian song with US folk ballads and civil rights anthems. It’s the sound of a star being anointed. Scuzzy rockabilly is best served fresh, and what’s fresher than two nights with the Cramps at Manhattan’s Peppermint Lounge? The pioneers of glam garage dive headfirst into 30 minutes of squealing punk. You’re never sure if the crowd are screaming because they’re thrilled or terrified. Nirvana’s acoustic set on MTV’s flagship franchise deconstructed their caustic sound to reveal a new side – albeit one that cast Kurt Cobain as far from comfortable with his rock star status. Come for the haunting Bowie and Lead Belly covers, stay for the devastatingly sparse Polly. Billed as their last ever show – even though they would return five years later – LCD Soundsystem’s 2011 Madison Square Garden swansong is an emotional rollercoaster. From furious electro breakdowns to squeeze-your-mates singalongs, you can see why they couldn’t stay away for too long. Kicking off with gruff directions to the loos from a compere, it’s an aptly ragged start to these recordings of the Americana great’s low-key 1973 appearances at a small Texan speakeasy with a busted air-con unit. If you can name a more fitting location to hear the harrowing Waitin’ Around to Die, we’ll give you a year’s supply of moonshine. Beyoncé’s groundbreaking 2018 Coachella headline set is testament not just to the vision of Queen B but her sheer energy. Who else could maintain such an all-singing, all-dancing thrill ride for two full hours? Marching bands, majorettes, a mini Destiny’s Child reunion and so much more – we’re knackered just listening to it. Unlike LCD, the Band’s lavish Thanksgiving 1976 revue really was their final gig. Filmed for posterity by Martin Scorsese, the show’s accompanying album features Mavis Staples nailing The Weight, Muddy Waters stomping through Mannish Boy and Joni Mitchell crooning a perfect Coyote. Yet somehow Neil Diamond steals the show. The perfect encapsulation of Neil Young’s sonic Jekyll and Hyde-isms, Live Rust begins with acoustic versions of the tracks Sugar Mountain and I Am a Child before he shifts gear, yelling: “Let’s play some rock’n’roll!” And doesn’t he just, pretty much inventing grunge on the grizzly and feedback-drenched Like a Hurricane."
"After nearly a month out of the spotlight, Donald Trump is expected to speak at this weekend’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a sign the Republican party is standing by him even after his incitement of the Capitol riot. “Why on earth would you want to stick with a guy who’s basically single-handedly responsible for your political annihilation?” wondered Seth Meyers on Thursday night. Even though the GOP lost the White House and the Senate in 2020, “Republicans stuck by Trump no matter how bad he was for the party because they agreed with him,” the Late Night host explained. “They were engaged in the same project and wanted the same things. With a few exceptions, they were all Trump.” Meyers zeroed in on the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who “literally wore the same clothes when they went golfing, like a chihuahua whose owner makes him wear matching outfits”. “It took an armed insurrection stoked by the president and fueled by insane lies about election fraud to finally put some distance between a few Republicans and Trump,” Meyers added. In the immediate aftermath of 6 January, even Graham “briefly suggested” that he might break with the president – “All I can say is count me out, enough is enough,” he said on the Senate floor. “I believe he was reciting a monologue from the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named De-liar,” Meyers joked, because “it won’t surprise you to learn that Graham almost immediately did a 180. He probably thought that by calling out Trump’s bad behavior one time he’d get to co-host a podcast with Obama and Springsteen.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on efforts to apprehend and prosecute those involved in the 6 January Capitol attack, such as one man who texted an ex photos and videos of the riot along with the message, “If you can’t see the election was stolen, you’re a moron.” “Yeah, ‘you’re a moron,’ said the man insulting his ex after texting her video evidence of his federal crimes,” Colbert deadpanned. The ex “did not take too kindly to being called a moron”, and promptly turned him into the FBI. He now faces up to 20 years in prison. “You go, girl!” Colbert joked. “That’s how you know you won the breakup – ‘Did you hear about Chelsea? She is doing amazing, she got a killer haircut, she’s dating a great new guy and she sent Richard to federal prison. Slay, queen!’” Another rioter, branded the “zip tie guy” for the restraints he was seen carrying in the House chamber, said in legal action filed this month that his actions “were a direct response to months of comments by President Trump”. “Yes, because there is no more time-honored defense for a fascist than ‘I was just following orders,’” mocked Colbert. And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah investigated the state of America’s power grids, under scrutiny after widespread blackouts left millions of Texans without power or water during a polar vortex. The four power grids in North America – western, eastern, Quebec and Texas – constitute “the most massive machine that man has ever built”, Noah explained. “And it’s amazing how it connects the entire continent – I mean, just think, while you’re blending a smoothie in your kitchen, Donald Trump is using the same electricity to shred his tax returns,” he joked. It’s a massive system that “unfortunately, like a tweet from 2010, hasn’t aged well”, he continued. The US grid loses power almost three times more often than it did in 1984, and far more than other industrialized nations; most of its power infrastructure hasn’t been updated in decades. “This is pretty worrisome – America’s living in 2021 with an electric grid that’s barely been updated in the last 50 years,” Noah said. “You have to update technology more often than that, people! I mean imagine trying to get through your life with the first iPhone. You couldn’t even use the maps app because New York wasn’t a state back then!” And the problems are getting worse, as the grids are liable to shutdowns from climate crisis-fueled extreme weather and cyber-attacks. “This is a scary future that the world is facing, but the good news is the United States now has Space Force,” Noah joked. “I mean, they won’t be able to protect the power grid, but if it does go down, someone in space can look down on Earth and be like, ‘Yeah, it looks like the lights are out down there.’”"
"At a first glance, Robin Frohardt’s New York installation appears to be more of a celebration than an excoriation of the pernicious plastic bag. From a distance, the cheerfully lit grocery store entices pedestrians in Adelaide’s Rundle Mall with a lurid cornucopia of edible produce, with its own dinky bakery, fruit and veg section, salad bar, dairy and shelves of packaged dry goods. But it’s not just the incredible prices that turn out to be too good to be true. The thousands of products on display are all handcrafted from decidedly unappetising single-use plastic bags. The Plastic Bag Store – which premiered in Times Square in October – is the only wholly international contribution to this year’s Adelaide festival, due to ongoing Covid-19 restrictions. Prior to its opening, Frohardt spoke to the Guardian over the phone from an Adelaide hotel room where she was enduring the mandatory 14-day quarantine. “The idea came to me many years ago, just watching someone bag and double bag my groceries which then went in another bag,” she says. “I realised how absurd it was. And so I decided that I would make a grocery store that was even more absurd.” The artist insists only the finest, locally sourced single-use plastic – freshly harvested from the streets and bins of New York City – was used for her project, which took several years in the making. Its creator may be something of an eco-warrior, but not without a wry sense of humour. Frohardt concedes the exhibition has evolved somewhat and taken on a local twang since it opened amid the shuttered stores and eerily quiet sidewalks of Manhattan. In the spirit of Australia’s truth in labelling consumer laws, the rebranding of familiar products, some custom made for an Australian audience, reflect the contents; Vegemite to Bagemite, Nestle’s Milo to Nastly Baglo and so on. The New York premiere coincided with the city’s introduction of a ban on single-use plastic bags (with some exceptions) – a ban that was delayed eight months due to Covid-19, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 28,000 of its residents. The New York Times described it as “an emphatic work of activism that is also a wistful work of art”. The Adelaide opening also coincides with a local eco-milestone. On 1 March, South Australia will become the first state in Australia to outlaw a range of single-use plastics, including plastic straws and cutlery and polystyrene cups, bowls and plates. The ban goes further than New York’s, where single-use plastic packaging is still permitted for takeaway food, uncooked meat, dry cleaning and garbage. Frohardt says the timing of her exhibition with the South Australian ban coming into force this week was fortuitous but coincidental. And she hopes Australians will embrace the show in the spirit it was intended: thought-provoking, a bit of a tease, free of preachy didacticism. “It’s definitely not about trying to shame people about their own plastic use, because I don’t think that’s necessarily productive,” she says. “We’re all part of a system that’s designed for our convenience, it’s really ingrained in our lives. “My hope is for people to get more of a context about the permanence of the disposable – we use plastic for seconds, but it has a life of thousands of years.” The shelf life of the exhibition itself is a question Frohadt dismisses with cheerful acerbity. “Hopefully, we’ll have it around for a long time, and then perhaps some [pieces] will be sold as art objects,” she says. “It definitely won’t go into the trash. “Even though that’s where it came from.”"
"The mood around Lake Cawndilla in western New South Wales on Saturday is funereal but defiant, as a procession of around 60 locals parade through scrub and sand around its banks. They carry between them a series of 30m-long cloth figures: three local citrus farmers and prominent Baakandji artist William Badger Bates. The fates of all four are tied to the health of the Darling/Baaka River, but like the embattled waterway there are still signs of life, and fight, in all of them. “It looks like a burial but it’s not,” French street artist JR explains the night before, via Zoom. “It’s a funeral march for what’s happening slowly in front of our eyes.” JR, an internationally renowned artist – whose past projects have commandeered sites ranging from the Louvre’s glass pyramid to an abandoned Ellis Island hospital – knew little about the Murray-Darling back in February 2020, when he flew into a country still choked with the smoke and trauma of that summer’s bushfire crisis. But then he stepped on to Baakandji Country with Bates. “The whole river’s empty, and all the locals tell you they’ve never seen it this way. I was really humbled in many ways because I’m on his land, and he’s an artist also,” he says of Bates. “Who am I as a French person to tell the story better than anyone there?” JR soon found common threads between the plight of communities in regional Australia and the struggle of farmers on Italy’s Alfina plateau who were at the centre of Omelia Contadina, his 2020 collaboration with Italian film-maker Alice Rohrwacher. His multi-part NGV Triennial work, Homily to Country, again uses photography, portraiture and people to bring a human face to ecological and ethical questions that often prove too big, too complex or too abstract to capture the public’s imagination. The first part of the work is on display in the NGV’s garden: JR’s shots of Bates and Rachel Strachan, Alan Whyte and Wayne Smith – farmers forced to all but abandon their orchards – invite reverence and reflection as stained-glass windows in a makeshift, open-air chapel. The second part consists of the procession at Lake Cawndilla, and a permanent, filmed record of the moment which will be added to the exhibition. Incorporating aerial drone photography that captures the scale of the cloth portraits set against the landscape, it’s slow, meditative art that courts online virality as part of its mission. “You hear about agriculture and the dilemmas; the farmers killing themselves. And yet there are no strong and powerful images that make you reflect on that. In Italy for example, when you go through the areas that are devastated by the monoculture of nuts ... for someone who’s a non-farmer like me, it just looks green.” The colour green hits differently around Menindee: recent reports of new toxic algal blooms have imperilled locals’ drinking water and raised fresh questions about why the river continues to languish despite years of government initiatives and billions of dollars meant to restore it to health. That ongoing sickness was vividly illustrated in 2019, when the oxygen-starved waters around Menindee became blanketed with up to a million dead fish. To Bates, these are existential questions: “I say the Baaka is my ngamaka – that means my mother. I have three mothers: my mum, my grandma and the Baaka. It’s fed us, and looked after us, and we really respect it.” Baakandji people and their river have adapted and thrived through an ice age and thousands of years of gradual change, but Bates says the upheaval brought by climate change and upstream irrigation is something else entirely. “We’re not helping nature, we’re making nature change its course. Us humans are doing it – we think we’re smart, but we’re outsmarting ourselves, and the proof is in the pudding at Menindee.” Two years on from the fish kills, what could have been a galvanising moment has left Bates and his community feeling exasperated and disempowered by yet more enquiries, compromises and photo ops without adequate follow-through. “You go back two months ago, Gladys [Berejiklian] came out and let a lot of fish go,” he says of the NSW’ premier’s recent release of 60,000 Murray Cod bred from a handful of survivors rescued from the 2019 fish kills. “We let them go, but now these fish are just about ready to die because the lower Menindee, where we put them in, there’s no water to keep [them] going.” Travel restrictions prevented JR returning to see his portraits make their pilgrimage back to the Darling/Baaka where they were taken – but, he says, it’s for the best. “I kind of like the fact that the march will happen with only locals. Because why do you need an international artist in the middle of it? My part was meeting the people, enlarging the photos, working with the museum. Of course I would have loved to be there to walk with everyone, but … it’s their project, it’s their fight, it’s their stories.” For Bates, a man who speaks with the beleaguered determination of someone who has tried everything and heard every excuse, the prospect of such an artist lending their international profile to his “darling Baaka” means a lot. “It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to us. He’s world-renowned, plus he’s putting something out there that we – that’s black people and white people that live on the Baaka – haven’t got a chance to do. This is giving us a chance. To me and everyone, he’s a godsend to us.”"
"Great art spawns imitation. And great weird art, it seems, spawns still weirder flights of fancy. Lewis Carroll’s twin children’s fantasies, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There have both inspired a string of adaptations, artistic and musical responses down the generations. Now, as the Victoria & Albert Museum prepares to celebrate Alice and her cultural influence in Curiouser & Curiouser, a landmark exhibition next month, a new book containing unseen original images is to expose the secrets behind the darker world of the second Alice story. “Together these books are really the first psychedelic texts and I like them because there’s no moral lesson. They actually parody authority, like the judiciary and the monarchy, rather than supporting them,” said Jake Fior, an Alice expert and author of Through a Looking Glass Darkly. “Carroll had a definite interest in the esoteric. I have a catalogue of his possessions, including his library, and he had lots of books on the supernatural,” he told the Observer. Fior’s fresh version of Alice’s journey attempts to elaborate and even improve upon Carroll’s difficult follow-up work, 150 years on from its publication. “If you think about the structure of Through the Looking Glass, it’s very weird and I always felt it could be improved. The idea of going through a mirror into a reflected dimension is fine, but then suddenly there is this Jabberwocky epic poem and the Vorpal sword and these mythical beasts which are never mentioned again. It is framed as a chess game in which Alice goes from pawn to queen in eight chapters, but it doesn’t run in a fluid way like Wonderland. It is a more flawed book, yet some of the moments are better, so I kept those in my version.” During the author’s research for his new approach to the story he discovered images that will now go on public display for the first time in the V&A show. Fior, who is the proprietor of the Alice through the Looking Glass shop in the West End of London, was already the owner of several original pieces of Carroll memorabilia when he came across a sketch book that had belonged to Carroll’s famous original illustrator, Sir John Tenniel. “It shouldn’t have been there, but I was at a rare book fair three summers ago and there it was, nondescript, with just the word ‘costume’ written on the front,” remembered Fior. As a student Tenniel used to skip his classes at the Royal Academy of Art and take his sketch books to the British Museum instead. This book was full of studies of armour and knights, prototypes of the images he went on to use in the Alice books. Fior uses these images in his book just as Carroll used Tenniel’s work: a dynamic mix of text and illustration, which he believes looks towards the arrival of the graphic novel. Fior’s story tells, in parallel with Alice’s journey, the true story of Samuel Liddell Mathers, a distant relative of the real girl Alice who had inspired Dodgson. Fior discovered that he had formed the secret magical society known as The Golden Dawn, patronised by major literary figures such as Bram Stoker, E Nesbit and Arthur Conan Doyle, and also by the notorious occultist Aleister Crowley. “There is no evidence that Carroll was practising magic, but he was interested in telepathy and was a member of the Society of Psychical Research. He also had a well known obsession with wordplay and especially acrostics, and these come from Hebrew mysticism, which he would probably have known,” said Fior. While working on the book he found that although Carroll was not a Freemason, the Liddell family were very involved in the organisation. The V&A exhibition, Fior suggests, will be a good opportunity for fans to go back to the darker side of the stories, something that the Disney cartoon version has almost obliterated. “The Disney image has become so strong, it has almost effaced Tenniel. But I find the animated visuals a bit saccharine. I always think of the phrase from Anthony Burgess’s Clockwork Orange “weak tea, new brewed” as opposed to the Tenniel which is full strength, with no sugar.”"
"Patton Oswalt at the Soho Theatre was truly transcendent. Before I walk on stage, I always remind myself to “be more Patton”. There’s a scene in Difficult People when a random character is daydreaming about Julie Klausner’s “long labia” and says in the most wistful voice: “I like it when the roast beef goes past the bread.” That’s a glorious piece of poetic filth, isn’t it? I got A Confederacy of Dunces as an audiobook. I laughed so hard I almost crashed my car on the M40. My husband Simon is also a standup comic. During lockdown he had a massive stroke and almost died. When he recovered in hospital, he became very angry at the fact that junior doctors wore Crocs and socks instead of “proper shoes”. He insisted on wearing a badge that said: “Q: Why do Crocs have holes in them? A: To let the shame out.” I did a gig at a gay bar in Houston. They were waiting for male strippers and hated me. A drag queen lurched towards the stage and screamed: “Sweetie, you gotta stop!” She flung herself at my feet and vomited all over the floor. It’s hard to retain your dignity when your trainers are drenched in regurgitated tequila. I had a T-shirt that said: “I’ve got hoes in different area codes” on the front and the words “forgetful gardener” on the back. I love a good pun. I had an excellent burger at The Notorious PIG and had it “biggie-sized”. During lockdown I cut my own fringe. I looked like Lawrence Olivier in Richard III. “Minge” is a great word. It’s short and punchy. Saying it makes you smile. Mary Bourke’s podcast Did You Smell Burnt Toast? launches 1 February "
"London-born Ashley Walters, 38, first found fame under the moniker Asher D, a member of UK garage collective So Solid Crew. He’s now best known as an actor, with film and TV credits including Bullet Boy, Hustle, Small Island and Top Boy. He currently stars in Sky One action series Bulletproof and recently made his directorial debut with Sky Arts short film Boys. Boys is about best friends on an east London estate. Was it inspired by teenage lads getting unfairly portrayed by the media?Definitely. It stems from me going through that with So Solid back in the day. We were villains in the press for a long time. That’s not to say we didn’t deserve it at times. But what I’m trying to say with the film is that kids make mistakes. I know that now from being a father of eight kids. Teenagers aren’t fully grown. They’re not cooked yet, as Judge Judy puts it. They need guidance or they can easily go down the wrong road. A lot of the negative things they do are a cry for help. I mentor kids at my local youth club who are heavily involved in gang crime. If you show them a different way, you can change people. Not everyone in a hoodie is a bad guy. It reminded me of last year’s British drama Rocks…That’s a cool comparison because I really liked that film. Actually, I’ve been speaking to Theresa Ikoko, the writer, about maybe working together someday. Why was this the right time for you to direct?I wanted to make a calling card, but it became a lot more than that. It was a great platform for [lead actors] Hector [Abbott] and Jude [Chinchen], who are talking to agents now. When you’ve been acting from a young age [Walters started aged 10], you become part of the furniture. This made me feel like a newcomer again. It’s given me a lot of hunger and fire. Were you keen to show the boys being emotionally open?Very much. We show Hector’s character in some vulnerable places. Opening up was something I had to learn myself. My youth was all about never showing weakness, but I led a double life. I was at Sylvia Young’s theatre school doing tap and ballet but couldn’t go home to Peckham and talk about that with the boys. Although I got caught out once when someone saw me on a poster outside the London Palladium, all dressed up for Oliver!. I got dissed for that (laughs). Experience has taught me the importance of sharing your problems. We have such a high rate of suicide in young men. A lot of that is down to how they think they should behave in front of other people. Breaking down those barriers is difficult but I’m up for trying. There’s an eye-catching piece of “I can’t breathe” graffiti in the film…When we were filming, George Floyd’s killing had just happened. When we saw that written on a wall, it was important to include it. I’d gone through a period when I was being told by people that I wasn’t being vocal enough, wasn’t using my platform, that my silence was helping racism. So that was a way to use my art to say it. Did you feel pressure to declare support for Black Lives Matter?Behind the scenes, I’m fighting for black voices every day. I’ve been doing it for many years. Posting something on social media might raise awareness temporarily but I want to make real change. We need to see more black faces on screen but also behind the camera, be it writing, producing or directing. Bringing new talent to the table will give this movement longevity. Was 2020 was a moment of change?It woke up a lot of people who didn’t realise racism was that bad. It shone a light on how hard it is sometimes to just live your life. It’s little things, too. The other day, I mentioned to a white friend how when planning holidays, me and my wife have to choose carefully which countries we go to. We’ve had so many bad experiences where people aren’t used to seeing black families. This guy was like: “Wow, I had no idea.” Maybe change isn’t happening as fast as we’d like but things are moving forward. Long may it continue. The latest series of Bulletproof is set in South Africa. How was it filming there?As glorious as it looks on screen. We wanted to take Bishop and Pike [London cops played by Walters and Noel Clarke] out of their comfort zone. The vibe in Cape Town is very creative and arty but, of course, there’s also the backdrop of huge inequality. We had tight security around us but we pushed to go into townships and mingle a bit, especially when our families came over. We wanted our kids to see the reality of people’s lives compared to theirs. It was eye-opening for them. You and Noel are close friends…Yes, but it wasn’t always that way. It used to be normal for young black men in our industry to view one another as rivals. There weren’t a lot of us on TV, which makes you territorial. You’re always pitted against each other for roles. I’d turn up to auditions, Noel would be there and I’d be like: “Oh God, here we go.” Before you know it, you’ve developed resentment for each other. But the day we got a chance to sit and talk, we realised how much we had in common and decided to work together. Bulletproof was our first idea. Are you shooting the next series of Top Boy? What happens with your character, Dushane?Dushane’s back in control but, obviously, you can expect things to go wrong. He’s going to be emotionally tested. There’s devastation and tragedy in his life that affect the way he runs his empire. The story goes to the next level. Drake was instrumental in the show’s move to Netflix. Have you met?Yeah, he’s a good guy; it came from a genuine place because he was a true fan, long before he got involved. LeBron James and Jay-Z love the show as well. Last season made a huge impression in the States. They were making memes or posting clips of Americans attempting UK street accents. That was a dream for me. Growing up, we’d watch US shows but they weren’t interested in ours. Social media and streaming services have changed that. How have you passed the time in lockdown?Exercise has kept me sane. I’ve been reading a lot. I’m an Arsenal fan, so it’s Ian Wright’s autobiography at the moment. I’ve also been cooking a lot: lamb stews, butterflied lobster tails, honey-glazed pork chops. My wife wants me to go on Celebrity MasterChef but I don’t want to get ahead of myself. Maybe in a few years. You’ve also been writing scripts. What about?I tend to write what I know. Right now, that’s fatherhood. Much as I might try to write about different things, somehow it always comes back to that. I’m writing a story about a young kid who’s put in the custody of a dad he’s never met before. I first became a father at 17 and didn’t have a clue what a dad was because I didn’t have one myself. So I mashed together all these different role models, some good and some bad, to make up my idea of a dad. I made a lot of mistakes but that’s how you learn. Have you been home schooling?My poor wife’s taken the brunt of it because I’ve been filming on and off. But when I can, I do an hour or two. I have newfound love and respect for teachers. They teach 30 kids. I’m just teaching my six-year-old daughter and that’s difficult enough. You just became a grandfather. How does that feel?It’s a beautiful thing. A very different feeling. And, finally, after all these years, I have a child I can give back at the end of the day. Bulletproof: South Africa and Boys are available on catch-up on Sky On Demand and Now TV"
"Hello and welcome to my 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet). I hope my list includes some of your favourites, something to brighten your day and maybe a comedy treasure that you have not yet discovered. Here we go. I discovered a world of amateur fishing videos during lockdown. This is my favourite. Who or what SK Media is, I don’t know. Did the man trying to catch the fish appreciate being filmed and interviewed? Who knows? Is there a shark or a sting ray on the end of the line? Does this have the best ending of any fishing video out there? I dare say, yes. The Flemings you will remember from the time they had a bat loose in the house and Derry had to catch it. Here we get to see Derry and the rest of the family go through the trials and tribulations of learning a TikTok dance. You will get to the end of this and ask yourself if that was some sort of SNL sketch. It isn’t. This movie exists. I have not seen it and after watching the trailer I feel I really don’t need to even though it does have Gary Oldman in the role of a lifetime. A miniature Shrek that goes like the clappers. This pic is an absolute highlight of early Covid times. Such a good boy. The costume and the dance choreography would be funny enough on its own but that trumpet solo takes it to the next level. The effortless way she can make someone incredibly uncomfortable and at the same time someone else is crying from laughter is one of the greatest comedy gifts. Shreds seemed to be a thing for week at some point in time. This was the first one I saw and I loved it and I went down a hole watching other shreds but it was a very shallow hole because I only needed to watch maybe two other shreds before I knew nothing would beat this one. OK, you might be that small minority of people who know and understand what happens at an equestrian event at the Olympics and be wondering why I would include this clip (which can’t be embedded) in a list of the 10 funniest things I’ve seen on the internet but that horse has some sick moves and can totally get you some K. An early example of the genius that is Anne Edmonds. Follow Geraldine on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."
"Everyone needs a go-to, feel-good romantic comedy and this one’s mine. A classic 2000s film by way of its music and fashion – think Uma Thurman in low-rise cargo pants – Prime is your standard, cheesy and PG-rated yet steamy romcom. However, the film is elevated by its use of realistic dialogue and a clever script twist that will make you chuckle and consider some deeper universal issues along the way. In Prime, director and writer Ben Younger chose to develop a character-driven love story for his second film while also paying homage to his home town, New York City, and his cross-cultural Jewish roots. With some big star involvement including Thurman and Meryl Streep, the film begins like any other romcom: with a meet-cute. Rafi (Thurman), a recently divorced 37-year-old woman meets David (Bryan Greenberg), a 23-year-old aspiring Jewish painter. Soon, they fall in love. The beginning of their love story is sweet and tender, with lingering, lustful looks upon their first encounter at the cinema, followed by a nerve-wracking but gutsy first-date phone call by David. In a short period, their relationship turns into insatiable passion and love despite their age gap. Things get complicated when Rafi’s therapist, the devout Dr Lisa Metzger (Streep), discovers her client’s new love interest and “the best sex of my life” is actually her son. It’s this second storyline that adds depth to the narrative and shifts this romcom into another gear. What ensues is both heartwarming and humorous as the film lightly explores the ethics of client-therapist confidentiality, cultural and religious clashes and the age gap. The viewer has the benefit of unravelling these topics through behind-the-scenes moments in Rafi’s therapy sessions and within Lisa’s home, in which her attitude and advice are the reverse. Upon the questionable advice from her own therapist, Lisa continues providing treatment for Rafi. However, here is where the dialogue and acting chops of one of the greatest actors of the 21st century kicks in. In a therapy session in which Rafi gushes about her sexual adventures with David, it’s Streep’s humour and idiosyncrasies that really make the scene. She gulps, pours and re-pours copious amounts of water to prevent the word vomit from spurting out. With a light touch, the film exposes the challenges of parent and child relationships when culture and religion clash with desire. Lisa wishes her son to marry within his faith. In one conversation, she asks him the stinging question, “Do you not value your culture and religion?”, to which David responds, “It’s not one or the other.” He follows this by exclaiming, “Do you hear yourself? You’re a therapist; you would never say [these things] to a patient.” It’s a dynamic that resonates across cultures. As a first generation Chinese-Australian woman, these conversations and behaviours around the complexities of family, religion, culture, individuality, relationships and love felt familiar to me. The film also draws attention to an alternative and acceptable form of love – the one that doesn’t last forever. As Streep’s character advises, “Sometimes you love, you learn and you move on. And that’s OK.” Connections for however long a period of time can be invaluable, profound and change. Prime allows you to indulge in a sexy romcom while touching on some life lessons that may resonate with you longer than you expect. "
"Of all the celebrity offerings that have come out of the pandemic, the gloriously weird videos made by Toyah Willcox and her husband, Robert Fripp, are surely the most compelling. It is possible, within each short clip, to cycle through every feeling from wanting to cover your eyes while being unable to look away, to the dawning realisation you may be watching a profound piece of performance art. Mostly, it is impossible not to laugh. There they are in their cosy Worcestershire kitchen, perhaps with the dishwasher open in the background, with Willcox, accessorised with mouse ears, tap-dancing, bouncing off the Aga. Both dressed in black tutus at the end of their garden, the pair dance across the screen to music from Swan Lake. Fripp lies on the floor of the hallway, while Willcox – dressed in red PVC and devil horns – performs the Kinks’ You Really Got Me on the stairs. It’s joyous. Willcox has been uploading their Sunday Lockdown Lunch videos since April last year; they also do a weekly agony aunt session, and Willcox does her own Q&A, talking about her life and long career as an actor, pop star and general cultural fixture for the past 40 years. It started, she says, as a way to occupy Fripp, the musician and founder of the prog rock band King Crimson. “Here I am in this house with this 74-year-old husband who I really don’t want to live without,” she says. “He was withdrawing, so I thought: ‘I’m going to teach him to dance.’ And it became a challenge.” They posted a video, and it took off. “It was: ‘Wow, I’ve never experienced the power of that connection.’” She comes up with it all, giggling to herself late at night in bed. “I do the lighting, the filming, the conceptual side and the persuading Robert to take part,” she says. Getting Fripp – famously self-contained and serious – to dance in tights and a tutu, she says, made him “fucking furious. He felt he was being mocked. But the response was so overwhelmingly positive, and now, six months down the line, he can see that it was quite an important thing to do, in that it became a shared experience with an audience that needed to be reminded of the beauty of human laughter.” Since then, she adds: “I’ve not put him in such desperate situations.” Instead, it is Willcox who throws herself in, with zero self-consciousness. She will wear an animal-print onesie, or dance around with ribbons, or pretend to be in a dungeon in their cellar, or jump on a trampoline while dressed as a cheerleader (Fripp, usually, is seated, playing guitar and dressed in a suit). One of the funniest, and most popular videos (4.3m views on YouTube), is Willcox performing Metallica’s Enter Sandman on an exercise bike, though it’s fair to say her breasts are the highlight. “We did the exercise bike in a rehearsal, and my top was completely see-through, which was a surprise,” she says. “I have a mentor who’s basically my personal trainer and teaches me guitar, and he was born in 1980, he doesn’t know who the hell I am. I said: ‘Can I get away with this as a 62-year-old?’ And he said: ‘Do it.’ And I trusted that response.” I praise Fripp for admirably maintaining eye contact with Willcox, despite her nipples being dangerously within his line of vision, and she laughs. “Robert loves his wife. And when I do these things …” This is not showing off for the camera; this is how the couple normally behave, she says. “I’m doing this to him all the time to make him laugh, because he needs to laugh. If people saw what we got up to, they’d wonder if we were nine years old.” She likes to hide in his shower room, for instance. “And he turns the light on and I’m in the corner like a demented child and it just freaks him out. We have had moments where he says: ‘Can this just stop?’” The past year has been a test for the couple. It has been the longest stretch they have spent together in 35 years of marriage – in normal years, both are touring or working away, and they lived in separate houses until 2001. “We really had to start again, to navigate being together in a confined space, because we have never had that. We had a very romantic relationship where we’ve always met in hotels around the world and this new life was challenging. I now think we love it so much we’re going to have to really start to embrace the outside world again.” Faced with the prospect of spending too long in the kitchen, she taught Fripp to cook. “I knew I was not going to survive if the kitchen became a mainstay of this experience, which is why Robert and I are very 50/50 in what we do, and we even do our own laundry. I’m not domesticated.” She has also been incredibly busy; Willcox rereleased her first album, Sheep Farming in Barnet, late last year, made a film, made a TV programme about her mother, and wrote and recorded a solo album, which will be released in the spring. “I’ve been phenomenally creative and I’ve been trying to understand why,” she says. “I can only put my finger on the fact that at 62, you know time is finite. And I thought: ‘I cannot let 2020 be a year that destroys my career’, so I’ve just been furiously creative.” She has also written some “little nonsense books, with a bee painted like Robert, that is always questioning who and what he is” and is learning to play the guitar. “There’s definitely that thread pulling me towards … I don’t call it the end, but the end of Toyah. Time is so precious and I think that’s why I’ve become ultra-creative. I remember when Derek Jarman was diagnosed with HIV, he said it focused him so much that he did his greatest artwork in that time. I don’t have anything to face like that, but I learned more from that lesson of Derek’s than from anyone else.” If you know Willcox only from her TV presenting in the 90s or the reality shows she has popped up in over the past two decades, you are glossing over her incredible career. Her first film was Jarman’s 1978 punk classic Jubilee, and she worked with the director again in The Tempest; she was also in Quadrophenia. Her first stage work was at the National Theatre. She was marketed as a punk pop star in the 80s, though this ended up turning her pretty much into “a parody of myself”, as she once put it, and she remained underrated, despite albums such as the highly experimental Prostitute. She once said she refused to be “a rock’n’roll wife”. What did that mean? “Robert would never ever let me live off him or his reputation. He just wouldn’t. We have separate bank accounts. He was so guarded when I first met him and I think why he liked me so much is I was fiercely independent and passionate about my work – he saw someone that wouldn’t cling. I knew I’d never have children, and Robert and I didn’t want family. I have been very passionate about remaining an artist.” As a child, growing up in Birmingham, Willcox was “a show-off. I realised I could entertain people, and it made people like me. I was probably seven when I realised it was the only thing I could do, in that I would not be able to suffer this life unless I was a performer.” Her early years were defined by medical problems – she had been born with a twisted spine and developmental problems with her feet and hip sockets, requiring surgery and physiotherapy. There were other crises – she was bullied at school for her disabilities and her lisp; her father, a factory owner, went bankrupt; and her relationship with her mother was difficult. “My mother was very complex. She never told the truth of her history to us.” Willcox recently made a TV show about this, so won’t go into detail, but says she found out that “my mother experienced something in her life which meant she never experienced happiness again. None of us understood why she was the way she was. It shattered me, because my mother went through something where she needed love, support and therapy. And she got a daughter like me.” By which she means wilful and nonconformist and with a body that disappointed her mother, who had been a professional dancer. “She was always kind of covering me up, and always wanted me altered in some way. I was never right.” Willcox was an “obedient child” in this claustrophobic house until she was about 12. Then, she says: “I completely rebelled, ran away from home, I started making my own clothes, I became a hair model where my hair was dyed at the age of 14, and I was touring in hair shows. I just broke every rule.” In 1982, at the height of her fame, she won an award for best female singer, and phoned her mother from the ceremony. “Her reaction was: ‘Don’t boast about it – it won’t happen again.’” Her mother lived near Willcox and Fripp near the end of her life and they managed to build a relationship. She has tears in her eyes when she talks about it. “We had two rather fabulous years with her; I still fought with her, but she became the woman that she could have been. She destroyed her life, because she could not talk about one event that happened to her when she was 16.” But it didn’t destroy Willcox’s life. Even talking over Zoom, I can almost feel her bristling energy, and she seems fearless and deliberately, relentlessly happy. “I am deliberately, relentlessly happy because my mother deliberately, relentlessly tried to stop me being happy,” she says, smiling. “So for me, it’s actually passive-aggression. I am a very positive person and I only like to deal with positivity, but sometimes, it’s passive-aggressive.” What was it like to become so famous so quickly? “It was fabulous!” she shouts. “It was everything I ever wanted. I had five utterly magical years where I felt the universe was placing everything in my hand.” She had been spotted on the streets of Birmingham by a casting director, who put her in a TV play; from that, she was cast in Tales from the Vienna Woods at the National Theatre. “And at the National I found musicians I could work with,” says Willcox. “People were absolutely gorgeous to me. Ian Charleson [the stage actor] took me to meet Derek Jarman, and I ended up in Jubilee. Everything fell into place. Looking back, I must have been so obnoxiously self-centred, but people saw me as some new generational spark, and doors opened for me.” She makes it sound so passive, but this underplays her own determination and charisma. It must have been tough to be a young woman in the music industry in the early 80s. “I was terribly naive,” she says. “I was being called to record meetings in people’s flats and I realised, if you’re called to a meeting at 8pm, you ain’t there because you’re an artist. I realised that this was sex for jobs – and no.” It was more explicit in the film business, she says. She went for an audition with Russ Meyer, the director of Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, for “one of his big booby films”, at a flat in Chelsea. “He said: ‘Can I see your breasts?’ and I went: ‘No.’ He said: ‘Well, you won’t be in this film.’ I said: ‘That’s fine’, even though Jubilee had nudity and the National Theatre had nudity. I just didn’t like the attitude.” It helped her survive, she thinks, that she was quite androgynous. “I think my boyishness protected me.” Would she have been seen as more of an artist, and less of a novelty act, if she had been a man? (I think so.) “I think partly it’s gender,” she says. “I think the sexual appeal of someone is huge. It really helps to have a sexual awareness and I fought that.” Willcox zigzagged from music to theatre to film and pitched up presenting TV programmes such as Songs of Praise and Watchdog, then appeared in reality shows such as I’m a Celebrity. In recent years, she has endlessly toured. What more does she want to achieve? “Everything,” she shouts. “I’m a megalomaniac!” She is preparing a Jimi Hendrix song for this weekend’s video. I dread to think what she has got planned for her husband in the weeks ahead, but he will play guitar, smile at her indulgently, and Willcox will continue to look as if she is having the time of her life. An expanded edition of Toyah’s album The Blue Meaning, released on 28 May, can be ordered from cherryred.co/toyah from 6 February. A new album, Posh Pop, will be released in July. Toyah & Robert’s Sunday Lunch videos are published at 12pm each Sunday on YouTube."

"Avatar: The Last Airbender/ The Legend of KorraThese animated TV series by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino are aimed essentially at young adults, but I highly recommend them to adults too. The narrative depicts Asian religious texts, mythology and ideas set in an adventure world. The writing is extraordinary. I’ve watched all seven seasons during lockdown – it’s just brilliant.Avatar is currently available on Netflix Malcolm X (1992)Throughout my life, I have revisited the film Malcolm X, based on Alex Haley’s book, directed by the great Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington. I see this film as equivalent to a Greek myth. It is a foundational text for my generation of black men, but I also believe it is vital it is shared with the generation growing up now (it’s rated 15). It tells the personal quest of someone redefining themselves, both for themselves and for the culture they come from. The film also presents the opportunity to engage young people with the 20th century’s resistance to systemic racism.Malcolm X is currently available on BFI Player Fun Kids Activity Quest Daily podcastFun Kids is a great digital radio station for kids, and their Activity Quest Daily podcast has creative ideas for lockdown for grownups and kids alike – we’ve made bath bombs, newspapers, puzzles and cupcakes. It’s a good one for inspiration if you’re running dry, which many of us are at this stage. National Literacy Trust, Virtual School LibraryThis library is a brilliant initiative from the NLT – every week a children’s author or illustrator provides free stories, activities and recommends their favourite books. An at-home library at your fingertips.Sophie Dahl’s first children’s book, Madame Badobedah, is published by Walker Fantasia (1940)Walt Disney’s classic film (or its 1999 remake, Fantasia 2000) still works as a brilliant introduction to Bach, Beethoven, Stravinsky via dazzling animation. But it’s long and uneven so try out clips first, starting with Mickey Mouse, unforgettable as the Sorcerer’s Apprentice. Mussila Music School app (iOS & Android)An award-winning app that boldly tackles the essentials of music – rhythm, notation, instruments – through play, reasoning and logic (age 6six up to any age). For pre-schoolers, try Mazaam – The Musical Genius, a charming educational game with classical music. Arte TVMy household consists of a novelist who generally persists in rejecting online life, a husband who doesn’t really like films or TV at all, an 18-year-old who enjoys Russian culture and sci-fi and a 14-year-old who would always rather be gaming with his friends. No one is impressed when I announce that we’re going to have a family movie night, or that I’ve found some great cultural resource to share. I think someone walked off in the middle of all of these, but your family’s probably more team-spirited than mine. Arte TV is an excellent and free source of films, documentaries and arts programming mostly in French and German. Useful for teenagers studying languages and adults hoping not to lose theirs while travel is forbidden – who wouldn’t be charmed by a short film about the cats living at the Hermitage? The “on reste ouvert” series has live-streamed concerts, opera and dance from the great theatres of Europe, and often at least three of us will watch at least half. People Fixing the World podcastWe’ve had some good conversations about this BBC World Service podcast, which explores practical solutions to problems ranging from police violence in America to maternal mortality in Nigeria to poor urban design in Europe. It’s generally cheering – curiosity and education turn out to be quite useful sometimes – and encourages kids to connect what they learn to ways of making a better future. The Teenage Inventor Special from November 2020 might be popular. Group writingThere’s no way my teenagers are going to keep journals or make a practice of reflection, but I had some success with an adapted writing exercise now taking place daily after dinner. We made a list of 10-15 questions about a day. (What did you enjoy? What did you worry about? What did you hope for? What did you make? What did you learn? What new thing did you see? What are you reading? etc – make them as weird as you like.) Every evening each person writes down an answer to any two. It doesn’t take long, so there’s less resistance to overcome, and the record is oddly moving, even if the answers are “I hoped Mum wouldn’t make us do this,” and “I learned that my French teacher can’t work Teams.”Sarah Moss’s latest novel, Summerwater, is published by Picador My Neighbor Totoro (1988)This Hayao Miyazaki animated feature, made in the 80s, is on constant rotation in our house. It is such a beautiful, quiet film about two young girls who move to the countryside to be closer to their mother in hospital, and find a fantastical creature living in the tree next door. It’s a true example of how, when the dial is kept turned down, a subtle ending can still feel like a hugely satisfying crescendo – something big-budget Hollywood studios would do well to remember.Currently available on Netflix Bluey TV showThis animated Australian TV series is a rare one that appeals at multiple levels. My kids love it, and any time I stick it on to create some distraction so I can do something else, I find myself getting sucked in to the relatable humour of the parents’ perspective. It’s given us great ideas for some good old-fashioned make-believe games to play, too.Currently available on Disney+ Mihran Kirakosian dance tutorials (YouTube)Savannah, our four-year-old, is getting into dancing, so during lockdown we have been doing choreographer and dancer Mihran Kirakosian’s hip-hop tutorials online. I think I’m taking it a bit more seriously than she is, as she usually breaks out into freestyle movement after about 10 minutes, but it makes her happy and it’s a good way of tiring her out so she sleeps well at night. David Attenborough’s A Perfect Planet (BBC iPlayer)We have discovered that Eden, our 16-month-old, has a bit of a thing for pandas, so we try to watch as many wildlife shows as possible. We are currently watching David Attenborough’s A Perfect Planet. Eden seems to like David’s voice, as for the most part he sits still and takes it all in. Production of The Girl and the RavenInspirational puppet theatre the Little Angel puts online Handbendi’s vivid production of an Icelandic fairytale: in darkness and snow, a small girl survives a landslide. Free until January 2022; donations welcome Shakespeare’s Globe 2019 production of Romeo and Juliet (YouTube)Filmed in front of a responsive audience at the Globe, a dynamic cast in modern dress take the stage by storm in a speedy 90-minute production created especially for young people. Available on YouTube until end of February Toontastic creative drawing app (iOS & Android)Screen time crushes us a little , but when we needed a break we found this amazing app called Toontastic. The kids make short animations by drawing the scenes and characters, and recording their own voices over to create the story. They have done some quite amazing cartoons. We try to do as much drawing as possible. Painting on lampshades is fun, and we are making a book called “night drawings”, which they make before bed. Annie [Morris, his partner] and I donated work to an activity pack for kids called “art is where the home is”, in collaboration with Firstsite museum in Colchester. A great list of contemporary artists contributed, such as Antony Gormley, Gillian Wearing and Grayson Perry. Annie made a colouring book and I gave instructions to create a repeated word drawing. The Railway Children (1970)We try to get the children to watch at least one classic movie a month, to break up the usual Pixar onslaught. One of the most successful was the heartwarming, enchanting 1970 film The Railway Children – both kids (Maude, eight, and Jago, seven) cried their little eyes out when the children’s father gets taken away to prison. There is something comforting about listening to the old English language and Yorkshire accents. Arthur, High King of Britain by Michael Morpurgo audiobookI speak as an expert on Michael Morpurgo and the mother of a child with dyslexia. This is a perfect book, enchanting for children and, thanks to the sublime narration, captivating for adults. It’s a story we know but it’s so very well done, with lots of heart, humour and danger. A great introduction for your child if they’re not great readers but they are interested in stories.Download for free from Calibre Open Culture websiteI always point people looking for anything arty to Open Culture, which is a free cultural and educational resource with a massive library of stuff, some especially for children. There are audiobooks like Aesop’s Fables and a big Neil Gaiman section, as well as all the classics for kids coming up to exams who are sick to death of the written word. Lots of links to other free content – podcasts, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), language lessons and museums and art galleries. There are also links to YouTube, where you will find my favourite, Boris Karloff reading The Reluctant Dragon. It’s a great resource, run by good people. Historical filmsWe’ve watched a lot of films with our kids – aged 15 and 11 – during lockdown. Gandhi (1982) and Doctor Zhivago (1965) provide a lot of history in short-cut. The issues around injustice and race are powerful and shocking. Remove phones and watch them become properly absorbed. Both kids are long-time fans of Studio Ghibli and Grave of the Fireflies (1988) induced lots of sobbing. It’s about a very powerful piece of history – two children trying to survive in post second world war Japan – that they certainly won’t be taught in school. Provocative filmsThese are the movies that have provoked the best round-the-table debates during lockdown: Okja (2017) created an instant vegetarian, and our budding drummer was utterly riveted by Whiplash’s artistic obsession writ large. “Not my tempo” has quickly become shorthand in our house. Finally The Sting (1973) – good old-fashioned entertainment with Redford and Newman showing us how it’s done, more class than almost all modern movie stars put together. Brilliant piece of film-making. Good tunes, too.All films currently available to rent on Amazon Prime Peppa Pig audiobooksMy two-year-old recently discovered that she loves Peppa Pig, and there is literally nothing to stop us watching it for 12 hours of every day. I’m trying to keep sight of some parenting goals, though, so instead we listen to Peppa Pig audiobooks on Audible and Spotify during the day. This means we don’t become total couch potatoes, and she still gets to engage with her first fandom. The format lets her enjoy the narratives, which is what I love seeing her get to grips with. If I had a choice over what we listened to, we’d spend less time with Peppa and more with Foley & Friends, a truly brilliant podcast from Sesame Street that makes cool use of sound effects. Lockdown Sonic JournalWe’ve tried quite a lot of hobbies in our house since last March. In the summer, a stint as twitchers got us into recording birdsong on my Zoom H6 field recorder. These days, my daughter and I like to take the Zoom out for walks and record all the ambient sounds, then listen back to the recordings later. A recording we took on Halloween, where she can hear me and her dad talking over fireworks and kids in the park, is her favourite thing to listen to. Most recently, we went out as a family on New Year’s Day and recorded the sound from the centre of a circle of trees. It’s our sonic journal of life under lockdown. The Water Horse (2007)The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep is an utterly charming 2007 film based on a Dick King-Smith book. It is set in 1942, in Scotland, where young Angus MacMorrow has the incredible fortune of discovering an egg that turns out to be a baby Loch Ness monster. What I love about this film is the cosy feeling it gives you. Families can cuddle up and enjoy the ups and downs of trying to hide the friendly monster who is growing at a stratospheric rate.Currently available to rent on YouTube or Google Play AR 3D Animals app (iOS & Android)This device-based activity is really cool and I think kids would have lots of fun with it. Using your smartphone, use the Google 3D Animals app to search for an animal (I tried with a lion). Select the 3D option and follow the instructions to access your camera. You can then take photos around the house or even outside – and guess what? The animal you chose suddenly appears in your shot! Forest School activities from Early Learning HQAs an antidote to long hours spent in front of screens, listening to teachers patiently repeating the mantra of the Covid age – “you need to unmute yourself” – set your children free in a green and quiet place with Forest School activities. I like to think of it as the rewilding of small humans. Wellies, warm clothes, waterproofs are essential; penknives, tindersticks, fire flints, binoculars optional. This is an excellent resource for activities to coax children into the outdoors, for teachers and homeschooling parents alike. The National Trust has an inspiring list entitled 50 things to do before you’re 11¾, with a printable worksheet. Online writing classesIf your child is jaded by times tables and grammar tests – or even if just you are – set them going on a creative task. A beautiful new notebook, with alluringly pristine pages, helps (I recommend blank hardback sketchbooks by Daler-Rowney; my children steal them out of my cupboard all the time). Children’s writers and illustrators have been gloriously generous with online advice. Try Cressida Cowell’s masterclasses on YouTube, or turn to book festivals, which have been quick to make certain events available online. The Edinburgh international book festival has some excellently inspiring children’s events that can be viewed at any time, as do the Hay festival and the North Cornwall book festival. Tony Hart’s TV shows (YouTube)Vision On and Take Hart remain for me the greatest creative art programmes in television history. Tony Hart conjured marvels out of chalk, newspaper, felt pen, ink or sand. He could turn a handprint into a portrait, soap into sculpture and a few pastel sweeps into a glowing landscape. Everything was art to him, and his originality liberated and inspired a generation of kids. The same would be true today if only BBC Archives would re-screen his programmes. But you can find him all over YouTube, including the first ever programme, a great compilation channel and this enchanting landscape on Hartbeat. Look and learn! The Royal Drawing School art classesThe Royal Drawing School’s classes and clubs for kids and teenagers are famously absorbing and rigorous. Run by excellent artist-teachers, they are online during the pandemic. Some places attract fees, others are free. Whole mornings spent drawing: what could be better? Model buildingA dear friend gave me a fairy house building kit, and my daughter (five) and I built it on one of those grey winter days when it is both too cold and not cold enough to go outside. It was the only craft thing I’d ever truly enjoyed doing with her (like truly enjoyed, not just enjoyed for her sake) and I think it is because the kit came with a hot glue gun, which I’d never used in my life. We both burned ourselves so many times, and giggled, bonding, as it were, over the punning pain. And I was like: “Oh man, my daughter loves hot glue guns, I wish I had known,” and then I realised it was that my daughter loved how much I loved hot glue guns, and I should have known. I am also making her do spelling bees. One-woman spelling bees. She may hate me, but she will also know how to spell onomatopoeia for the rest of her life. Studio Ghibli filmsWe’ve been watching all of these on Netflix as a family: me, my husband Neil, and our boys, 14 and 10. They’re so meditative and beautiful, like reading a book together. The Tale of The Princess Kaguya is a brilliant, lesser-known one about a bamboo cutter who finds a tiny girl growing inside a glowing bamboo shoot. When Marnie Was There, Arrietty and Kiki’s Delivery Service are great too. These films make kids look again at the world. One day, on our family walk, my youngest son was looking at the light of the sun coming across the clouds on the sand dunes and said: “That’s so Studio Ghibli, Mummy!” Bless him. Simply Piano appMy husband works as a baker, so he’s out very early in the morning, and I’m at home in the week with the boys, doing Instagram gigs every Thursday to keep me sane. We’re all learning piano together, though, one by one, on the Simply Piano app. You all get your own profiles, and put the iPad up on the piano and it teaches you songs note by note. We’ve gone for pop song mode, and it’s great. I only did grade two as a kid, and I’ve realised I’ve forgotten it all, so I’m learning too!Kathryn Williams’s debut novel, The Ormering Tide, is published by Wrecking Ball Press in March Google Quick DrawWho doesn’t like to doodle? This site/app challenges you to draw an everyday object, the better to train a neural network. In our family, the draw here – pardon the pun – is to change the language setting, so you pick up useful French words (other languages are available) while sketching impressionistic teapots. (This language hack also works on other apps, games and gadgets.) GeoGuessr websiteOn this website you see a spot out in the big wide world and decode the street furniture to guess where you are. You can opt for famous places, but the real fun is to choose somewhere random, and glean where you are from the jaunty slant of the parking meters. You have to sign up (there are free options), but it’s worth it. Not only do kids get a feel for what things are actually like in other countries, you inevitably find yourself saying things like “those pylons definitely have something Australian about them”. In the 70s, in North America, kids’ TV routinely ran groundbreaking animated shorts about grammar, maths and civic engagement. In between cartoons, kids were indelibly imprinted with little songs about pronouns, or how a bill became a law. One song about the number three – 3 Is a Magic Number – was sampled by De La Soul for their hit The Magic Number; I’m Just a Bill was lovingly parodied by Saturday Night Live and even Hamilton owes these ditties a spiritual debt. Wonderfully, Conjunction Junction, the US Constitution’s preamble and all their ilk are on YouTube. (Fronted adverbials were only invented by the Tories in 2014, so no folky earworm exists for those.) StorytellingMy wife and I do a storytelling session before sleep, and choose stories that the children may not hear at schools – ones that originate from Africa, India, Japan or other parts of Asia. Sometimes, we search for stories from pygmy or indigenous tribes on the internet, read them, and then try to retell them from our memory. AnimationWe have been watching animation films that convey stories that aren’t mainstream. I would particularly recommend two directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart: Song of the Sea and Wolfwalkers are two of a trilogy of films they have made based on Irish folklore.Currently available to rent on Apple TV Farnam StreetMy recommendations stem from my own interest in developing the art of in-depth, thorough conversation and debate with my children around any and all current social, intellectual and moral issues. The first comes from an exceptional website, Farnam Street. Its authors offer insight and inspiration by drawing from great writers and philosophers. One blog post in particular, a video of Bertrand Russell, is excellent. Russell is invited to offer advice to a society 1,000 years in the future; his response is flawless. VoxWe do not use the N-word in our house, or anywhere for that matter, and yet it still seems a confusing and complex issue for many white people who feel that, like rappers, they should be able to use it. Ta-Nehisi Coates explains it perfectly in this video. Open CultureIn attempting to understand the extraordinary political events of the past few years I began to think about the careless way both the American and British middle class referred to swathes of Americans as “trash”. As our disdain and disregard for the economically challenged gathers pace, let us pause and examine the precise ways in which we are culturally conditioned to see fault and responsibility where there is only fate and insurmountable disadvantage. Kurt Vonnegut puts it much better than I could. PlayStation 2/Xbox/Sega Mega DriveGet your old consoles out of the attic, set them up, make a cosy corner in the living room and play them with your kids. Mine are 12 and 10, and they’ve loved us playing all together. It’s been hilarious: we’ve played Tomb Raider: Anniversary and Star Wars Episode I: Racer on the Xbox. Sonic on the Sega Mega Drive next! But get outside too. I made a cardboard house for my daughter to do her schoolwork in, strung blankets into hammocks in our tree, and can recommend buying a big sheet of polythene to make a slip and slide for the garden! KiwiCo Project CratesThese are art boxes I found online in the first lockdown that help teach kids Stem subjects. They’re amazing, and set for different ages – we got the Atlas and Tinker Crates. We’ve built our own robots, made LED signs, a perpetual motion machine and learned about bioluminescence. My 10-year-old made a Big Ben with a working clock face the other day.Eliza Carthy’s Through That Sound (My Secret Was Made Known) and the Eliza Carthy Songbook are out now, available at eliza-carthy.com Play with cushions, a washing-up bowl and a laundry basketOur toddler, Wilf, is not always easily amused or distracted by screens, and we don’t have a garden. So, during lockdown we utilised what we had, and he loved most playing with a washing-up bowl full of bubbles, which became a magical ocean for his plastic shark. The sofa cushions became a bouncy car which flew, and the laundry basket a dodgem we launched and span around the kitchen. Conversation challengesMy older son, Bertie, is nine and lives with his mum in Manchester and, although he still comes for weekends and holidays in lockdown, sometimes the bi-weekly Skypes have been hard, with neither of us doing much. So, we challenge each other to bring a topic for next time, and we’ve had some crackers along the way since March. Back in the spring he asked me to find out about the history of Lego and last week I asked him to think of a plot for the next Star Wars trilogy!David Eldridge’s radio play First Out is on Radio 4 online Thanks to all our young illustrators, including members of the Arty Farty Malarky online art club"
"The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump began in Washington on Tuesday, just over a month after a mob of Trump supporters breached the Capitol for the first time in over 200 years, left five people dead and injured 140 others. Just before opening arguments, 44 Senate Republicans voted against a measure affirming the trial’s constitutionality – a deceptive dissent, as “most of these Republican senators, the vast majority of them, want Donald Trump to be impeached”, said Jimmy Kimmel. “They know what he did, and they pretty much want him to go away. There’s nothing they would like more than for Trump to be legally prevented from ever running again. “The reason they’re even having this trial is because he sent maniacs on a panty-raid of their office,” Kimmel continued. “They’re just too afraid to do the right thing, because Trump and his bag of boiled nuts will then target them. They saw what happened to Mike Pence” – rioters looking to punish him for not intervening in the symbolic Senate certification of Biden’s electoral victory – “and they’re afraid. The sad truth is that they’re a bunch of cowards.” Trump, meanwhile, was reported to be “deeply unhappy” with his lawyers’ performances, “so those guys aren’t getting paid,” Kimmel quipped, wondering how the president was watching the arguments unfold. “I want to know everything – I want to know where he’s watching, what he’s wearing,” Kimmel said. “Did he put a suit on with the extra-long tie? Did he get his jowls all tanned up? Was he in a pair of Maga sweat pants with an Oreo blizzard in his lap? I don’t know, but I want to.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers refuted the Trump defense’s argument that it was unconstitutional to impeach a president no longer in office, calling the notion “ridiculous”. “It doesn’t say that anywhere in the constitution,” he continued. “If you manage to flee the scene of a crime before the cops can catch you, you don’t get to automatically go free. If that was the case, Trump would’ve finished his speech and then immediately jumped in a white Ford bronco.” For the prosecution, Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland argued that to drop impeachment simply because Trump was no longer in office would create a dangerous “January exception” to the US constitution and presidency. “Yeah, the founders didn’t intend to write in an exemption where you can commit whatever crimes you want during your last month in office,” Meyers said. “It’s called a transition, not the purge. This isn’t the last week of middle school, where every teacher shows a movie while they google ‘vacation Caribbean cheap’ and the French teacher tells you all the good swears.” “Here we go again, again,” said Stephen Colbert after day one of impeachment round two, which gave the Late Show host a “real feeling of deja-coup”. Colbert first turned to the prosecution, which played a “devastating” video of the violent riot storming the Capitol and threatening lawmakers. The video “was especially hard to watch for the cowards in the Senate,” Colbert said, noting that several GOP Senators avoided watching it, instead averting their eyes to papers in their lap or, in the case of Rand Paul, doodling in his notebook. “You know what they say, gentlemen,” Colbert said, “see no evil, hear no evil, makes you seem really evil”. Forty-four Republican senators voted Tuesday that the trial was unconstitutional, “because they don’t want to have this trial”, he added. “Well, tough nuts. The country is like a bar – the last president puked in the bathroom. Somebody’s got to clean it up or we can’t use the bathroom anymore. Oh, and you’re the ones who decided to be a busboy, so grab a mop and do your job.” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah honed in on Trump lawyer Bruce Castor’s bumbling performance, which included such lines as “Nebraska, you’re gonna hear, is quite a…uh..judicial thinking place.” “Here’s the crazy thing: it doesn’t actually matter what this guy says,” Noah explained. “He could get up there and show his pubes for hours, because the jury has already reached its verdict.” “Before this trial even started, almost every Republican juror has made it clear that they don’t want a trial at all,” Noah continued. “And I get it! I get why Republicans voted this way. Because on the one hand, yes, an angry mob stormed the Capitol building where they work and could have killed them. But on the other hand, everyone hates jury duty.” The constitutionality vote “might make the trial seem pointless now”, Noah concluded. “But just because we know how the trial will end doesn’t mean the trial shouldn’t take place. “I mean, when you’re watching Law and Order, do you turn it off in the first five minutes when the cops interview a dentist who obviously killed his patient to cover up an affair?” he joked. “Of course not! You watch the whole thing, because then you get to say ‘I knew it!’ when you end up being right.”"
"On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed the shocking situation in Texas, where a brutal winter storm has left half a million residents without power and around 200,000 without clean water. “Texans have been lining up for clean water from public spigots, boiling their own, or even trying to melt snow,” said Noah. “You know that the infrastructure is screwed when your best option for water is to mug a snowman.” There was controversy this week when Ted Cruz was caught on camera leaving the state during a time of emergency to go to Cancún with his family. Noah joked that the Texas senator “had to travel 800 miles just to get heat, water and electricity”. The news has put Cruz in the firing line, with many criticising what has been seen as a selfish move at a particularly dire moment for the state. “You’ve gotta be shitting me, dude!” said Noah. “Your people are literally eating snow right now, and you’re jetting off to Cancún? I’m not even mad that you were selfish. I’m mad that you were so stupid. How can you be in politics for ten years and still have no idea how bad this would make you look?” Cruz has claimed that like many Texans, he has been without power and his family have grown as tired as other residents. “Look, I get that Ted Cruz is tired – the man deserves a break after trying to overthrow the government,” Noah joked. “But this is not the time, Ted! When your constituents said they need clean water, they didn’t mean go find a wet T-shirt contest in Cancun.” He then referred to his “just gross” excuse that he was merely chaperoning his daughters to Mexico rather than visiting himself. “Being a good father means putting them on a bus not throwing them under one,” Noah said. On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host also took aim at Cruz, saying that he “did what any great leader would do when his state needed leadership most, he booked a flight to Mexico and said adios, amigos”. Pictures were quickly shared on social media this week of Cruz at the airport, on the plane and eating noodles at the lounge. “In case you were wondering if there was anything grosser than Ted Cruz, there is: Ted Cruz slurping a cup of noodles,” Kimmel said. He referred to him as “a world-class liar” as he tried to weasel out of the hole he had dug for himself, claiming that he knew it was a bad decision as soon as he booked the tickets. “As soon as people started posting pictures of him on the plane, he looked up and knew he shouldn’t be on the plane,” Kimmel joked. Kimmel also quickly moved onto the wintry weather in Washington DC, suggesting that residents could stay warm by “climbing inside Mitch McConnell’s throat pouch”."
"More than 3,500 names in the Australian music industry have signed an open letter calling on the government to extend jobkeeper beyond 28 March. The letter, drafted by the music rights organisation Apra Amcos, was sent to prime minister Scott Morrison, treasurer Josh Frydenberg and arts minister Paul Fletcher on Wednesday. Signatories include Paul Kelly, Archie Roach, Missy Higgins and Bernard Fanning, along with members of bands the Cat Empire, Birds of Tokyo, Killing Heidi and Midnight Oil. The chief executive of Apra Amcos, Dean Ormston, said the music industry had been one of the sectors hardest hit by Covid-19, with analysis showing live music was still operating at 4% of pre-Covid levels. “The last 12 months has been one of the most distressing and destabilising in living memory,” he said. “The constant wave of lockdowns and state border closures means that any local live music events and national touring is impossible to plan. “Hospitality and tourism dollars generated from our sector remain stifled. We are an industry in crisis.” In early January, jobkeeper was reduced from $1,200 a fortnight to $1,000. At the time, Frydenberg confirmed the Covid wage subsidy would cease altogether at the end of March. However, the tourism minister, Dan Tehan, has confirmed that the government is devising a package of targeted support for that sector due to the long-term disruptions to international travel, and Frydenberg has indicated that other sector-specific support may be considered. Multi Aria award nominee Peter Murray told the Guardian he and his band relied on jobkeeper for most of 2020. “I’m not so much concerned about myself, I can always do solo shows,” he said. “It’s really the other guys that are affected, the session musicians and your crew. And you know those guys in particular, they live week to week, they’re the guys that are really going to suffer if jobkeeper stops. And I don’t know what these guys are going to do.” Murray said if sector-specific wage assistance was not on the table for the live music industry in 2021, federal and state governments needed to at least introduce some form of travel exemption for musicians and crews. “That’s how we earn our money, we travel interstate, we travel around the country … if [the government] is not going to continue to pay jobkeeper, then something else needs to open up, so we can travel and we can actually do our jobs,” he said. “If jobkeeper stops and we can’t gig, then the industry is going to die quickly and it will be very hard to come back.” Melbourne-based artist Gordi said she, too, considered doing solo shows because of the cost and complications associated with ongoing cross-border travel restrictions. “But there’s 10 other people relying on me for their income at the moment, so yeah, that makes you feel terrible,” she said. Gordi, who is also a recent medical school graduate, stayed off jobseeker in 2020 by picking up locum work as a doctor. She has just completed a three-month contract with St Vincent’s hospital in Melbourne. “I’m sort of going month by month at the moment, but I think I’ll probably get some work in the Covid vaccination clinics coming up,” she said. “That’s the way I’m subsidising my income at the moment but I’m in a very fortunate position where I have this alternative career. A lot of people don’t have that, so if there’s no live performance then they’ve got nothing.” An RMIT-led study commissioned by the Victorian Music Development Office and the Victorian Office for Women released earlier this week found 58% of Victorian respondents working in the music industry were considering leaving it post-Covid-19. More than half the respondents said they were struggling to pay for basics such as food and rent. “We can’t afford to lose the skills and businesses of our sector,” Ormston said. “The result for Australia would be catastrophic.”"
"The academic leading the National Trust’s efforts to explore links between its properties and colonialism has warned of a “menacing” attempt to censor and politicise historical research. Prof Corinne Fowler, the director of the Colonial Countryside project, said her work was “absolutely not political” and that politicians should not “weaponise history”, adding: “When you try to interfere with academic freedom in the name of free speech, you’re steering the country in a dangerous direction.” Fowler spoke to the Guardian ahead of a government round table with 25 heritage organisations to discuss their history amid a national reckoning over institutions’ links to slavery in particular. This weekend it was reported that Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, would use the round table on Tuesday to warn organisations against focusing too heavily on Britain’s imperial history. In a letter to the Common Sense Group of MPs, Dowden said the country should not “run from or airbrush history” and asserted that “public funds must never be used for political purposes”, the Daily Telegraph reported. Dowden and the heritage minister Nigel Huddleston have invited leaders of 25 heritage charities, museums and art galleries to the discussion in Whitehall, including the National Trust, Historic England, British Museum, Horniman Museum, Imperial War Museum, Science Museum Group, National Portrait Gallery and British Film Institute. The culture secretary is expected to discuss contested heritage and encourage attenders to adopt a “retain and explain” strategy towards historical artefacts, such as statues depicting individuals with links to the slave trade. A National Trust spokesperson said: “We always aim to be transparent and factual about the places we care for and we look forward to the discussion.” Fowler and the National Trust have been at the centre of a growing row over Britain’s approach to history, with the Common Sense Group of more than 50 Tory MPs in January asking the culture secretary to investigate how funding was agreed for the Colonial Countryside project, which it described as an “ideologically motivated endeavour” to rewrite history. The four-year project, which started in 2018, received funding from the Arts Council and the national lottery, and is investigating the African, Caribbean and Indian connections of 11 country houses the National Trust manages. It is working with 100 primary pupils, 16 historians and 10 commissioned writers, and hopes its legacy will be “to ensure that colonial connections are integral to the stories that audiences discover” when visiting sites. Fowler also co-edited a report, commissioned in 2019, into connections between 93 National Trust properties, and colonialism and historic slavery. Fowler, a professor of postcolonial literature at the University of Leicester, said it was “menacing” to suggest the government will determine which future projects are funded. “How can less history be better than more history? Surely we should be expanding and deepening our understanding of history in all its complexity,” she said. “And historians do rewrite history. Stonehenge has just been discovered to have a different history based on new evidence. It’s the same with colonial history, as new evidence comes to light, we reassess our view. That’s what historians do.” Fowler said she had been researching country houses and empire for 10 years but her work had never received this level of attention previously, something she attributes to a “culture war” being declared after the Black Lives Matter protests last year. “But some of us don’t want to fight culture wars, we want to have sensible conversations about evidence-based research,” she said. She likened the attacks on her work to those previously experienced by climate scientists, adding: “I’m very worried that all across Europe, and in the US and in Australia, there are similar attacks on academic freedom like this. And these attacks tend to be directed at prominent female academics.” “We need to be vigilant here and stand up for a healthy democratic society, which still believes in the quality of evidence and research rigour.” Also speaking ahead of the round table, Sharon Heal, the director of the Museums Association, urged the sector to “ensure editorial integrity and resist attempts to influence content and interpretation by interest groups including funders”. “It seems odd to be prioritising this now when so many who work in museum and heritage are focusing on recovery and welcoming our communities safely back into our venues,” Heal said. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been approached for comment."
"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all The monthly price of a Disney+ subscription went up by more than a third last month and, whichever way you look at it, that’s quite a hike. Yes, it only took it from £5.99 to £7.99, which is hardly criminal in return for the service effectively doubling its library. But Netflix’s standard subscription also recently received a bump from £8.99 to £9.99 per month. Likewise, Now TV’s Entertainment Pass hopped from £8.99 to £9.99 back in September. None of these individual prices are anything much to whinge about, considering the sheer mountain of entertainment each provides. Amazon Prime Video remains excellent value at £7.99, as does Apple TV+ at a practically-giving-it-away £4.99. A few prices may have crept up of late, but you would have to be profoundly tight to rail against any of the figures mentioned here. Until you add them together. To save you some maths, the combined price of the packages mentioned above is now £40.95 per month. If you’ve got the premium, multiscreen Netflix package (and your parents obviously use your login, so of course you have), that has gone up by £2 to £13.99. Do you like watching shows in full HD, as opposed to a blurred, 70s-porno swirl of shape and colour? Then Now TV – quite amazingly, in 2021 – will ask you for an extra £3 a month. Suddenly, you’re forking out £48 per month for telly. Chuck in BritBox and it’s £54. Which is considerably more than the price of the old-school Sky TV subscriptions most of these streaming services were designed, and predatorily priced, to supplant. And let’s face it: if you are paying that not inconsiderable sum for all these services, there is more programming being slopped on to your tray than any human person could ever hope to consume, even during the afternoon-pyjamas expanse that is lockdown. Netflix’s true-crime output alone provides more hours of new programming than there are in even the most slovenly week. There are eight seasons of The Blacklist. Eight! And isn’t that new Marvel series about to start? But you never even got round to watching Homecoming! But there’s that Sherlock Holmes thing, too, and Cobra Kai, and … it’s simply exhausting. These services are, of course, entirely optional. And having too much great telly is a far nicer problem than the alternative. However, as more companies jostle for a piece of the pie, opting in and out of the ones you want month by month becomes the only option for anyone who doesn’t want to splash more on TV than they do on their gas and electric bills. With such a bewildering array of services on offer, each pumping out their own “unmissable” shows, we have reached a point where premium TV is an ungainly, untameable monster that is now either prohibitively expensive or a right faff. And wasn’t the whole point of the streaming revolution for it to be neither? At the moment, it’s just about manageable. But please, guys, no more. You’ve been a great pal this past year, but it is possible to have too much of a good thing. No, no, it’s not you, it’s us. Don’t cry. Oh god, now we’re crying! "
"“We’re once again being confronted with yet another deadly plague that has haunted this country for decades: the plague of gun violence,” said Seth Meyers on Wednesday night, referring to two deadly mass shootings, in Atlanta and Boulder in less than a week. “And in both cases, there has been a small minority of sociopaths with outsized power in our politics who stand in the way whenever the rest of us try to do something about it.” On Monday, the day a 21-year-old man killed 10 people at a grocery store in Colorado, Fox News barely covered the shooting, Meyers explained; host Sean Hannity mentioned the shooting at the top of the show and then moved on to a segment about Biden tripping up the stairs of Air Force One. “My God, get your priorities straight,” Meyers fumed. The Boulder shooting happened six days after a white man in Atlanta targeted Asian spas in Atlanta, killing eight amid a wave of anti-Asian violence, all while the pandemic continues “and your top story is the president tripping on the stairs?” Meyers fumed. “How’s that going to go over with your sponsors? Aren’t most of them stairlift companies?” Even worse, said Meyers, Hannity attacked Democrats on Tuesday’s show for “rushing to capitalize” on the Boulder shooting with gun safety legislation. “You guys repeat the same bullshit line every time we go through this awful ritual: that gun safety advocates are somehow rushing to politicize it,” said Meyers, who riffed through some facts: the US gun violence epidemic killed 19,000 people in 2020, and the majority of Americans support gun safety reforms such as universal background checks, mandatory gun licenses and a ban on semi-automatic weapons. “It’s the politicians and their patrons in the gun lobby that are holding that up.” In the wake of the Boulder and Atlanta shootings, many have once again called on Congress to pass gun safety legislation, while others “are calling on the NRA to pass the money bucket”, said Stephen Colbert. Republicans are trying “the same old cynical of switching the subject away from guns to things like mental health or video games or ‘look over there! It’s a Dr Seuss-themed gay wedding cake for the marriage of Pepé Le Pew and Mr Potato Head!’” “We have more guns, that’s why we lead the world in gun violence,” the Late Show host explained, citing research which found that though the US is not more crime-prone than other developed countries, the omnipresence of guns makes crime far more lethal. “Our gun violence is different because we have guns,” said Colbert. “And until that changes, nothing will change. And that won’t change until everybody votes.” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed global outrage over violence against women, following the murder of Sarah Everard in London as she was walking home at night and the shooting of seven women in Atlanta because the killer blamed them for his “sex addiction”. “For many women, every time they leave the house, it’s a risk,” Noah said. “And this is not something that men experience. Like when the pandemic hit, men were like, ‘so just going outside is dangerous now?’ And women were like, ‘yeah, just add it to the list.’” Yet much of the discussion has focused on women’s behavior – why they were alone, what they were wearing – instead of the men who perpetrated violence. “You can’t solve violence against women without addressing the men committing it,” Noah said. “It would be like trying to address gun violence without restricting access to guns,” he added with a mock laugh. “I mean, who would be that stupid … to think that you could stop gun violence … without trying to stop access to guns. “We have a responsibility to teach each other,” he concluded. “As men, we should be steering this conversation to where it belongs, centered on us. Because this is our responsibility not to be creeps. Let’s not make this the one thing that we don’t take credit for.” And on Full Frontal, Samantha Bee tore into the NCAA’s mistreatment of female athletes at the March Madness college basketball tournament. After being criticized by some players for vast discrepancies in weight rooms between the men and women, the NCAA apologized “but their real message had already been sent”, said Bee. “Women athletes are worth less than men.” The NCAA also provided the women with less opulent swag bags, lower-quality food and less accurate Covid tests. “Basically, while the men got the gold standard of virus testing, the NCAA asked women to cough into a handkerchief and whisper ‘it’s nothing,’” Bee joked. It’s a stark manifestation of larger inequalities: the NCAA pays men’s conferences hundreds of thousands of dollars, but provides no payouts at all to women’s teams. The 1972 measure known as Title IX bars sex discrimination in college athletics for schools that receive federal aid, but many schools don’t comply, and the NCAA is not subject to it. “That’s not a loophole, that’s all-hole,” said Bee. “The fact is, women’s NCAA basketball is an ‘if you build it they will come’ situation. The more support and coverage women’s athletes get means the more the NCAA can make selling their games,” she concluded. “This isn’t complicated.”"
"Actor Jessica Walter has died at the age of 80. Walter, best known for her Emmy-winning role as Lucille Bluth in Arrested Development, died in her sleep at her New York home. “It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of my beloved mom Jessica,” said daughter Brooke Bowman in a statement. “A working actor for over six decades, her greatest pleasure was bringing joy to others through her storytelling both on screen and off. While her legacy will live on through her body of work, she will also be remembered by many for her wit, class and overall joie de vivre.” The actor had won an Emmy in 1975 for the series Amy Prentiss and received three nominations for her performance as the sarcastic matriarch in the hit comedy show. Walter was also known for her voice work in the animated series Archer, playing Malory Archer, the former CEO of the International Secret Intelligence Service. Her most notable big-screen role was in Clint Eastwood’s 1971 thriller Play Misty For Me, as a woman scorned, a film many saw as a vital inspiration for Fatal Attraction. Her other big-screen turns included John Frankenheimer’s Grand Prix and Sidney Lumet’s The Group, both released in 1966. “I lost more parts than I’ve ever had, but you realize quick that you have to be like a terrier with a bone,” she said to Elle in 2019. “So I did the circuit. My God, I did the circuit. If it’s a good role, I don’t care what the medium is, I take it.” Walter’s most recent big-screen appearances included the comedies The Mimic and Undercover Grandpa. She also provided her voice to the animated Harley Quinn series and appeared in episodes of American Housewife and Good Girls. Tributes have arrived online from those in the industry. Tony Hale, who played her son in Arrested Development, tweeted: “She was a force, and her talent and timing were unmatched. Rest In Peace Mama Bluth.” Henry Winkler, who also starred on the show, wrote: “It was an honor to watch her comedy explode from the very first row.”  Walter’s husband, the Tony-winning actor and star of Friends Ron Leibman, died in 2019. She is survived by daughter Bowman."
"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all After this September’s No Time to Die, there will have been 25 official James Bond films (15 based on Ian Fleming’s novels). In all, one rule prevails: our tux-clad, Vesper-martini-swigging hero escapes an over-complicated death scenario while the bad guy ends up getting drilled (Tomorrow Never Dies’ Elliot Carver), boiled alive (Dr No) or ejected into outer space (Moonraker’s Hugo Drax). So how come Bond always escapes?  For example, Live and Let Die’s Dr Kananga dangles Roger Moore above a pool of man-eating sharks and – oops! – Bond gets away. Goldfinger straps Sean Connery to a testicle-splicing laser and – d’oh! – Bond survives. The Spy Who Loved Me’s Karl Stromberg pointlessly stalls for time by instructing Jaws to “Wait until they get to shore then kill them” and – whaddaya know? – Bond escapes. At no point do any of these evil “geniuses” manage to complete the job. As Scott Evil says in the Spy Who Loved Me spoof Austin Powers: “Why don’t you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?” “I have a better idea,” reasons Dr Evil, “I’m going to put him in an easily escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death.” So – ignoring the fact that he has to survive in order to continue the franchise – why do Bond villains favour these convoluted deaths? We all know that Bond baddies are homicidal paranoiac egomaniacs with a hidden inferiority complex who must make a masterpiece of Bond’s death. Auric Goldfinger (a plutocrat), Karl Stromberg (an oil baron) and Licence to Kill’s Franz Sanchez (a drug lord) each have CVs full of criminal experience. They’ll score far more kudos in their industry for something elaborate like lowering Bond into a pit of sharks with frickin’ laser beams attached to their heads. Blofeld lives in a hollowed-out volcano, Stromberg an underwater base and Die Another Day’s Gustav Graves in an ice palace. They must be dying to have a houseguest to try out their overpriced death traps. Shark food, winch rope and trapdoor hinge polish: the expenses for maintaining a shark pit are endless. Goldfinger’s lasers can’t have come cheap. “Do you expect me to talk?” “No, Mr Bond, at 24.9% APR, I expect you to die … slowly.” In the novel, Goldfinger stops chopping Bond in half with a chainsaw because he realises Bond is worth more to him alive and might be able to help with a heist. It’s a convoluted set-up that ends with Goldfinger bizarrely letting Bond do some typing instead. So there’s another reason for not killing Bond: you can get him to do your admin. Plus, The Man With the Golden Gun’s Scaramanga is Spanish, Blofeld is German and Franz Sanchez is Mexican, so the longer Bond is alive, the longer he’ll keep dishing out free oral lessons in the Queen’s English. It’s not as if the baddies aren’t exasperated, too. “Why can’t you just be a good boy and die?” exhorts 006 turned Russian agent Alec Trevelyan in GoldenEye. “You first,” insists Bond. Meanwhile, Hugo Drax laments: “Mr Bond. You defy all my attempts to plan an amusing death for you.” There, perhaps, lies the answer: not simply shooting Bond is the result of good old-fashioned British politeness. "
"I’m a 30-year-old stand-up comedian who has grown up with it and never known anything else, so it’s just there as part of my world, like water, air and video clips of people falling over. Here are the 10 funniest things. This video went viral a couple of years back in Scotland and it’ll never leave our hearts. Say the word “Disgusting” in front of any Scottish person and I can almost guarantee they’ll reply “Well it wiz f*ckin’ wan a yez! DISGUSTING!” If they don’t, they’re probably a Tory in disguise. What a video. What a meme. What a mum. If I ever need to cheer myself up, all I have to do is watch compilations of people saying “No” to marriage proposals. You might think “Oh Daniel, that’s so cruel!” Is it? Is it cruel? Have you ever been dumb enough to propose to a human being you weren’t certain would say yes? I proposed to my fiancée a month ago and people kept asking if I was nervous – no. I knew she’d say yes. If I didn’t know she’d say yes, I wouldn’t have fucking asked. Only an idiot would wing it. Can you fathom the stupidity required to buy a ring for someone you met three months ago and think, “No need to learn her second name, she’ll just take mine! She’ll love this. At my favourite sports stadium no less”? Well, now you don’t have to.  Limmy is not only responsible for one of the best comedy shows Scotland has ever produced, he’s also a great on Twitch. His streams really made me laugh during lockdown. He plays computer games and improvs and it’s so funny. This is a particular gem that kills me. I love gigging in Liverpool, I love visiting Liverpool and I have close friends who live in the wonderful city. But the football club can do one. Steven Gerard slipped in a match against my club Chelsea (yes, I’m a bastard) and it cost him the league; he retired without ever having won the Premier League. And this will always hurt a Liverpool fan when you remind them of it. They’ll say it doesn’t hurt. They’ll yell “Champions League” and “2020!”. But it does hurt them. Deep down. And that’s very funny. Norm MacDonald is an excellent comedian and this is one of my favourite bits. My best friend Jean loves free hotel breakfasts and I love sleep. You couldn’t pay me to get out of bed to eat breakfast. But she would always drag me to get breakfast if she joined me on tour, and I’d go to shut her up, and this sketch always made us laugh. I love Aunty Donna very, very, very much. I would like Broden to be my father. Which is an option: you can pay $20k on Patreon and Broden will be your dad for the day. They put it up as a joke, but I’ve seriously considered it on several occasions. My fiancée stopped me halfway through the credit card details once. They’re so good. Look, I’m a big ol’ stoner. Sorry. But I took an edible and this video of a baby giraffe had me sobbing tears for about 20 minutes. What a truly dumb animal. Stupid, adorable moron. Put your tongue back in your mouth, that’s not where it goes. In the discussion of what is the funniest cartoon – Family Guy, Simpsons, Futurama, Bojack, Rick and Morty etc – they’re all fighting for second place. South Park is unequivocally the funniest by a country mile. It’s the funniest social commentary of all time, its hit rate is second to none, its episode turnover is astonishing and it’s never apologised. They’re also responsible for the greatest musical of all time, The Book of Mormon. This clip of Trey Parker and Matt Stone laughing like kids as grown men just fills me with joy. I hope I’m still that stupid when I’m older. And for any expats out there..."
"Gill Wright had only one child, but her daughter, Sarah, always said she had a sister: Victoria Baths, the magnificent “water palace” of Edwardian Manchester, to which her mother devoted the last 25 years of her life in an attempt to bring it back into public use. By the time Wright died, aged 62, from a brain tumour earlier this month, her influence had spread far beyond Manchester. As the founder in 2015 of the Historic Pools of Britain campaign, she was a one-woman oracle of British swimming history. No one knew more about the UK’s watery heritage, and no one was as committed to protecting and restoring it for future generations. As news of her expertise spread, she would receive SOS messages from around the country every time a council tried to balance the books by closing a much-loved swimming pool. Wright would argue that a community pool had just as much cultural importance as a stately home or museum – if not more, given that swimming has consistently been one of Britain’s most popular participation sports. Wherever Wright travelled, she carried a swimming costume in her bag. The last item on the agenda of every meeting of the Historic Pools of Britain campaign was always a dip. She was a coach for Northern Wave, an LGBTQ+ club, and taught thousands of children to swim at Manchester Splash. “Every child a swimmer, every swimmer a lifesaver,” she would say, quoting her friend Sunny Lowry, the long-distance swimmer who learned to swim at Victoria Baths and swam the English Channel in 1933, aged 22. Not everyone shared Wright’s enthusiasm. She once went to a Manchester city council meeting where one of the councillors proudly introduced himself as the person who had signed the death warrant for Victoria Baths. He certainly was not going to bring it back to life, he insisted. “We’ll see,” she said. It was sometimes hard to keep the faith. Wright fervently believed Victoria Baths would be resurrected after it was voted the nation’s favourite heritage project in the 2003 BBC TV series Restoration. Viewers fell in love with the ceramic tiles and mosaic floors and, in particular, the stained glass – one huge sheet of which Gill had kept under her bed for safekeeping for several years before an archive was established. But the £3.5m prize could only stretch to renovating the building’s exterior. Wright, a spreadsheet whizz and champion form-filler, successfully applied for further grants totalling £1.6m, but was knocked back for many more. She pinned her hopes on at least the Turkish baths being returned to use, including the “aerotone”, a violent Victorian massage Jacuzzi she thought was a hoot. Though Wright’s dream was always for swimming to return to Victoria Baths, she and her team paid for the building’s upkeep by renting it out for weddings and beer festivals, as well as to film crews. In recent years it has appeared in Peaky Blinders and Cold Feet as well as the Channel 4 Aids drama It’s a Sin. Born in Liverpool, Gill was the third daughter of Cleo (nee Milward) and John Wright. John was an industrial chemist working at the Dunlop tyre factory and Cleo was a foster carer who trained as a special needs teacher after bringing up her own five children – Sue, Veronica (Vee), Gill, Martin and Stephen. Cleo was a committed member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, holding meetings in the front room of the family home in Toxteth and taking the family to Greenham Common and on Stop the War marches. John was involved with the local Labour party. The children were all taught to swim at a young age – essential for family holidays on their canal boat. Gill and Vee spent their teenage summers restoring derelict canals with the Waterway Recovery group. As a young adult Wright campaigned for buildings around the Ellesmere Port canal basin to be brought back into use; they were eventually reborn as the Ellesmere Port boat museum. After studying chemistry at Leicester University, her first job was at Shell on the Wirral, where her father had started his career. Social justice and community service suited her better than the oil and gas industry and she soon found work as a welfare rights adviser at Warrington law centre, eventually transferring to south Manchester community law centre in the early 1990s. Her daughter, Sarah, was conceived with an already ex-partner, Martin Lowe. They remained on good terms but Wright was a single mother by choice, bringing up Sarah in a large shared house in Rusholme, near Manchester’s Curry Mile. They lived less than a mile from Victoria Baths but she never swam there before it closed in 1993, because her housemates had told her it was ridden with cockroaches. It was her great regret. After a seizure last March, Wright was diagnosed with a brain tumour and spent the pandemic in and out of hospital. This January doctors advised she stop treatment and Sarah, a paramedic, moved back home to look after her. Sarah survives her, as do her siblings and Cleo. Her father died in 2004."
"As you walk up the paths that spiral this grass-covered earthwork, you don’t immediately see that it’s a colossal female nude. With this modern pagan monument, Jencks created a 21st-century answer to the chalk horses and giants that dot Britain. It will give future archaeologists headaches trying to understand our matriarchal fertility cult. With outdoor Covid restrictions set to ease, ponder this spectacular enigma for yourself. To sit in one of Turrell’s Skyspaces is to become aware of the magic of light as the circle of sky revealed by its open roof interacts with subtle lighting to slow you down and open your eyes and mind. Turrell is a sculptor of the senses whose primal and mysterious aesthetic blurs reality and dreams. A triumph of compassion and pathos. The tragic expressions of Rodin’s ordinary people surrendering themselves to save their town have universal dignity. It portrays an incident in the hundred years war when the English offered to spare Calais if six citizens volunteered to die. This 1889 French artwork is even more poignant in the Brexit age. This big, bronze lozenge pierced by a circular void is like a giant eye framed against the wild sea. You can look past it and through it at the grey, green and black waters below. Hepworth lived in St Ives and the way the blue surface of this public sculpture melts into the warm, south-western sunlight shows you why. This Victorian masterpiece remembers ordinary people: not with statues, but with harrowing accounts of their selfless deaths on ceramic plaques that fill a wall in a quiet City of London park. As you read, you see terrible imaginary events. Ghosts gather round you. Don’t go alone. You can walk up this (often pee-scented) staircase to Edinburgh’s Old Town without noticing that it’s art – which is Creed’s point. He makes art that insists it’s just another bit of the world. Yet look down and the steps are made of colourful marble that would do an Italian piazza proud. Art and nature interact in green and shady splendour on the paths through this spectacular forest in the Lake District. Land artist Andy Goldsworthy’s Taking a Walk for a Walk is perhaps the most poetic sculpture, a curving stone wall receding into the forest’s depths, covered in moss as nature reclaims it. Some of the most enigmatic art ever created can be enjoyed in British landscapes: the stone circles, barrows and tombs built by neolithic people. Avebury is free and open to visit, partly because there’s a village enclosed inside the stones. Nearby Silbury Hill is a great walk, as is the avenue of eerie megaliths. It all adds up to a haunting and visually striking day out. Oldenburg, one of the greatest American artists, whose pop sculptures of burgers and cakes helped change perceptions of what art was in the 1960s, shows how to go beyond statues. Captain James Cook’s 1769 account of observing the transit of Venus becomes a note in a bottle – but the note is the bottle. Before Hambling walked into controversy with her Wollstonecraft memorial she created this quieter work, a bronze shell commemorating Benjamin Britten on an atmospheric stretch of pebbled shore. The sea crashes, the wind whistles, the shell echoes – can you hear the mermaids singing?"
"“The modern conservative movement seems concerned above all else with preserving their solemn right to be dicks to everyone around them,” said Seth Meyers on Thursday’s Late Night as he tore into Fox News. “And they like to say that facts don’t care about your feelings until you hurt their feelings by politely asking them to wear a mask or stop using racist slurs, and then they melt down.” On the mask point, Meyers referred to Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who earlier this week irritatedly refused to wear a mask after requested by a reporter. “Man, Ted Cruz is the Steph Curry of being a giant dick. He never misses a shot,” Meyers said. “He’s the kind of guy who would come to your house for a dinner party and when you politely ask him to take his feet off the table says ‘you’re welcome to leave, if you like.’ “In that situation, Ted Cruz was the one who was vaccinated. He’s the one who was unlikely to get sick,” Meyers explained. While preliminary data suggests that vaccinations prevent asymptomatic spread, he continued, Cruz broke CDC recommendations and common decency by refusing to mask up before un-vaccinated reporters. “Apparently he couldn’t care less if anyone else in the room got sick. My God, no wonder his neighbors ratted him out when he went to Cancún,” Meyers said, referring to the PR fiasco last month when Cruz and his family flew to Mexico as his constituents froze without power in Texas. Cruz then lied about the details, and was exposed when their friends leaked group chats to the New York Times. “You know how unlikable you have to be for your neighbors to go to the press?” Meyers scoffed. “If you invite someone to go on vacation and their reaction is, ‘I’m telling the New York Times,’ you might be a bad guy.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon recapped Joe Biden’s first press conference as president. “Normally when a 78-year-old answers an hour of questions they’re getting a physical,” he joked. The presser was “quite the event”, he continued. “If you did a shot every time Biden said ‘look, folks,’ you got drunker than a ship captain in the Suez canal.” Biden announced during the conference that Kamala Harris would oversee the challenges at the US-Mexico border, where immigration advocates say an increase in the number of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum has been mischaracterized by conservative media as a “crisis”. “It’s similar to how Trump put Pence in charge of handling the pandemic – when the going gets tough, presidents are like ‘you’ve got this, right? You handle this,’ Fallon joked. “It’s like a middle school principal telling the vice-principal, ‘I’ll stay here while you chaperone the field trip to the glass museum.’” In other news, Fallon later added, the New York State legislature has reached an agreement to legalize marijuana. “You’ll know when weed is legal when tourists are walking behind New Yorkers being like ‘let’s go, let’s go!’” Fallon said. “Soon you’ll see a guy on the street be like, ‘hey, you took my parking spot! Enjoy it, friend.’”"
"In the weeks since the attack on the Capitol on 6 January, many followers of the conspiracy movement QAnon have tried to shoehorn its “messages” into the belief will Donald Trump will still somehow be inaugurated for a second term. “Ultimately, Q supporters are just gonna have to face the fact that their guy lost in the highest voter turnout in US history,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show. “Republicans have accepted it. They looked at voter turnout and decided it is time to stop voter turnout.” Republicans in 43 states have introduced a “tidal wave” of anti-voting legislation, such as in Georgia, where House Republicans responded to the state’s Democratic flip by passing a bill to limit absentee and early voting. The bill’s sponsor said it’s “designed to begin to bring back the confidence of our voters back into our election system”. “OK, but the Republican governor, the Republican secretary of state, the Republican voting systems manager all said it was a fair election,” Colbert retorted. “So there’s plenty of confidence in the election, you’re just confident you’re gonna lose it, so you’re tilting the playing field. That’s like the NFL restricting Tom Brady to restore confidence in the Kansas City Chiefs.” “The US still has a long way to go toward making a real recovery from the pandemic, but we’re entering a new phase,” said Samantha Bee on Full Frontal. “The fog is clearing and we can finally start scrutinizing the behavior of our leaders, including the ones we used to like,” she added, turning to the allegations of sexual harassment, bullying and unwanted advances that have imperiled the career of the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, in recent weeks. “Looks like Andrew Cuomo is the biggest dirtbag New Yorkers have elected since … pretty much every previous dirtbag we’ve elected,” Bee joked. “Guess we have a type!” Bee called the allegations, in which female former staffers say Cuomo used his power to proposition them, “disturbing but not surprising”. “Cuomo seems like the kind of guy who thinks it can’t be sexual harassment if he didn’t use the word ‘toots’,” she said. “Back in 2020 we were so desperate for a leader who wouldn’t tell us to go bleach ourselves, we turned our governor into a hero,” Bee continued, pointing to media fawning over the governor’s competent coronavirus briefings, for which figures such as Ellen DeGeneres called themselves “Cuomosexuals”. We know Cuomo is not a “hero”, Bee continued. “If we want to demand the best from our leaders, regardless of whether they’re Democrats or Republicans, we can’t treat them like we treat our food journals. We have to be honest about them, like we do in our dream journals.” “Just because Governor Cuomo stepped into a leadership void during the pandemic,” she concluded, “doesn’t mean he gets a pass on his consistently shitty behavior.” On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah tore into the near-complete rollback of coronavirus safety protocols and mask mandates in Texas and Mississippi, even as public health officials warn of a deadly fourth wave and the Biden administration pledged to have vaccines available for all American adults by the end of May. “Why are things reopening all of a sudden?! Corona’s not over yet!” Noah exclaimed. “I mean, Texas is still getting over 7,000 new cases a day, but their governor got vaccinated and now he’s like, ‘get those clubs back open, imma get lit!’ “I can even understand wanting to open businesses back up because of the economy,” Noah said, referring to Governor Greg Abbott’s decision to allow Texas businesses to reopen to 100% capacity. “But people, lifting mask mandates? That makes no sense at all, no sense. Like, I’m sick of corona too, but this is not the time to ease up on masking. “We’re so close to the end of the pandemic, we can see it! Why are these governors letting their guard down?” he concluded. “I bet these are the same people who read Tortoise and the Hare and they’re like, ‘What a great story about a rabbit who took a refreshing nap.’” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also ripped premature removals of coronavirus safety measures in several states with the end of the pandemic on the horizon. “We’re so close, we can’t screw it up now!” he said. “Come July 4th, you could be knocking back a cold one in your neighbor’s yard while he flips burgers and drones on about how much better it is to cook with charcoal. You’ll be seeing so much of your neighbors you’ll start praying for the next pandemic. “We can get there. It’s possible, we just have to spend then next few months not screwing up. Which of course means some governors immediately started racing to screw it up,” he added, pointing to Texas and Mississippi’s reopening, and the fact that the US is still recording 1,500 deaths from the virus a day. To great consternation from health officials, Abbott rescinded the state’s mask mandate, which prompted one public health expert to say the governor “lost his mind”, on MSNBC. “In fairness, maybe he didn’t lose it,” said Meyers. “Maybe it just froze during the massive power failure that happened on his watch.”"
"Musicians and their fans need to be told by the government that they must be vaccinated in order to attend music festivals this summer, according to two of Britain’s leading festival directors. Festival tickets have been selling in record time since the government set out its roadmap to recovery last month, yet these events may still be in jeopardy say many of the 70 independent festival organisers who held an emergency meeting on the subject on Friday. “A lot of us want to urge government to follow the example set up already in other areas, like travel, where people will have to show proof of vaccination or of a recent test,” said Josh Robinson, events director of Hospitality Weekend in the Woods, a drum’n’bass festival set to take over a park in south-east London in September. Gareth Williams, director of Cropredy, the folk festival hosted by the band Fairport Convention on the borders of Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire in mid-August said: “What we really need is for government to say everybody needs a vaccination to get in. We need that clarity, rather than each having to go to people and explain.” Robinson sold 16,000 tickets in five hours for his new festival, a spin- off from established annual events staged in the capital. “The demand is pretty unbelievable. It would normally have taken eight or nine months to sell that many,” he said. “The roadmap has given fans the impetus to start buying, which is great, but we are operating like a bank or something, in a strange scenario where we are just holding people’s money in case we have to return it.” Uncertainty about the pace of the pandemic’s retreat and about safety regulations both mean that final confirmation of dates is on hold. Last week, ex-Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown declared that he would not play at an event with a vaccination-only policy. This has added to the complexity of communicating entrance requirements to performers, as well as to punters and stage crew. Brown is a virus sceptic and has pulled out of an appearance at Neighbourhood Weekender in Warrington, saying: “I refuse to accept vaccination proof as a condition of entry.” “What we should say to artists now is another morally tricky conundrum,” said Robinson. “But if we don’t go ahead soon, the whole support structure for this industry could crumble for good.” The lack of a national vaccine entry standard is just one obstacle in the path of festival organisers, who still hope to win government insurance cover for cancellations and to receive help from the next round of recovery grants. Williams and 70 other organisers were among those at the remote post-budget meeting on Friday to share concerns. Most were worried about being expected to run mass infection tests. “We just can’t test everybody. We would need an airfield to do it,” he said. “The recovery grant has been very helpful, but we are still knocking on the door, lobbying for financial cover, as we cannot go beyond the end of March and start paying for everything without some extra security. It is a huge financial risk. Our festival is small-to-medium size, but it still costs one and a half million to put on.” Williams suspects folk festivals like his that cater to older audiences may face a simpler situation, since many punters will have had both jabs. “We do have an older demographic anyway, which may make it easier,” he said. “Or a lot may depend on having the extra space for social distancing.” Many festivals have moved back their dates, so late summer is now crowded. Even if there are plenty of eager punters to go round, festival workers are scarce. “The supply chain is going to be a big problem to kick-start,” said Robinson. “We all need freelancers to set up the bars, the staging, the fencing, the lighting and the sound systems. We would normally employ between 300 and 400, and they’re going to be hard to find. Some have just gone out of business.” Both men are holding their nerve till the end of this month. “Festival organisers are masters of contingency planning, but there are just so many factors to keep track of this year,” said Williams."
"Thursday, 11 March, marked one year since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, and to observe the dismal year of an endless March, Jimmy Kimmel hosted his “first and hopefully last” coronaversary show in sweatpants, with extra toilet paper on hand. “Remember when we were carefully disassembling our Instacart deliveries like a munitions expert in The Hurt Locker or something?” he recalled of quarantine’s frenzied early days. “If somebody said N95 to you one year ago, you would think they were a bingo caller.” “We haven’t been able to see friends, hug loved ones – I miss physical contact so much I applied for a job at Governor Cuomo’s office last month,” he joked. It’s “hard to believe we’ve been in for a whole year since people were dancing in clubs, people were eating in crowded restaurants, passing bongs around the beach, partying like it’s 1999”, Kimmel added over footage of people partying in large groups on the beach. “It seems like yesterday. And you know what? That was yesterday. Those clips were from Texas and Florida, yesterday.” Joe Biden struck a note of optimism in his first primetime address as president on Thursday, as he promised vaccine eligibility for all American adults by 1 May and touted the possibility of outdoor group gatherings for the 4th of July. The speech came exactly one year after Donald Trump downplayed the severity of the virus in primetime, calling the risk “very, very low”. “That’s what they say about owning a casino, and he bankrupted three of those,” Kimmel quipped. “I think we all remember where we were when we heard the news” of the pandemic “because we’re all still there”, Stephen Colbert lamented on Thursday’s Late Show in observance of the pandemic’s first anniversary. “Of course, it’s also the one-year anniversary of the first time I Lysol-ed a banana,” he added. Colbert recalled his naivety about the pandemic at the time; in a clip from his first at-home show, he urged viewers to “get comfortable” as experts expected Americans to stay home for eight weeks. “First it was going to be eight weeks, then Easter, then Memorial Day, then July – it was worse than waiting for the cable guy!” Colbert joked. “The CDC should have just issued a statement that said: “Your pandemic will end shortly, please be home between the hours of 8am and three years from now.’” Colbert also touched on Biden’s primetime speech, which honored the sacrifices made during the pandemic while previewing a “return to some sense of normalcy”. “OK that sounds nice, but what the hell constitutes normalcy,” Colbert wondered. “Even before the Covid, there was systemic racism, global warming, half of us heard ‘Yanny’, the other half heard ‘Laurel’, the world is chaos.” To advocate for his administration’s vaccination plan, the Biden administration also unveiled a public service announcement featuring the Obamas, Bill Clinton, George W Bush and his wife Laura, and even 96-year-old Jimmy Carter. “But there’s no sign of the last guy,” Colbert observed. “Maybe his invite got lost in the mail because he destroyed the postal service.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers mourned a year since “we all trapped ourselves inside our homes with stockpiles of gin and red wine watching Tiger King and Love is Blind while clinging to our last shreds of toilet paper like a plank floating in the water after a shipwreck”. It’s also been a year since Trump delivered a rambling, off-script address to the nation in which he downplayed the risks of the virus. “Trump’s bizarre, half-hearted speech one year ago is in stunning contrast to the seriousness and gravitas of the speech President Biden delivered tonight, exactly one year later, to mark the pain the country has endured while also offering hope for the future,” said Meyers, noting the $1.9tn Covid stimulus bill Biden signed on Thursday. The bill is enormously popular, with 75% of Americans and 59% of Republicans approving the measure, “and yet Republicans have derided it as a so-called partisan bill”, said Meyers. But some of the “most galling behavior”, he added, came from Republicans who tried to take credit for aspects of the bill while still voting against it, such as Senator Roger Wicker, a “no” vote who tweet-bragged about stimulus money for small businesses. “I know these guys are shameless, but I’m still shocked,” said Meyers. “They’re the kind of guys who would run out and try and lift Tom Brady on their shoulders while wearing Chiefs jerseys.”"
"Cast, crew and management working on the long-running TV series Neighbours could face legal action if any of them are found to have engaged in racist, offensive or discriminatory behaviour. Production house Fremantle Media will launch a legal investigation to back up its previous promise of an independent review into alleged racism against actors of colour. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) has stepped in, with the union’s director of equity, Michelle Rae, writing to the Fremantle Asia Pacific CEO, Chris Oliver-Taylor, a past president of Screen Producers Australia, late last week. “In the wake of these allegations, MEAA is in discussions with Fremantle Media and industry stakeholders to insist on the implementation of anti-racism, sexual harassment and discrimination training for everyone working on screen productions,” she said in a statement to the Guardian. Fremantle Asia Pacific has so far refused to respond to specific questions from the Guardian outside its previous statements, saying the company will make no further public comment until the investigations are complete. The Australian actor Remy Hii, who appeared in more than 50 episodes of Neighbours in 2013/2014 and has since worked extensively overseas – including Marco Polo and Crazy Rich Asians – told the Guardian on Friday he was aware of Indigenous and Indian-Australian actors on the Neighbours set enduring racist and offensive comments, although he had not been a target of such behaviour himself. He said the revelations from former cast members Sharon Johal, Shareena Clanton and Sachin Joab over the past week did not surprise him, but much of the public reaction had. “I’ve worked in America a lot, and if anything like this came to light there, my god, heads would be rolling,” Hii said. “You’re talking about a ‘burn the institution down’ kind of reaction, there is no way anyone would be able to get away with it. “It’s actually crazy seeing the kind of general public response … people who have tried to sweep it under the rug go like, it’s not that big a deal, get over it. If this happened in America, the repercussions would be swift and they would be severe.” Among the allegations raised by former Neighbours actors over the past week are those by the Indigenous actor Shareena Clanton, who claims the ‘n’ word was used repeatedly on set by another employee despite her objections, and claims by the Indian-Australian actor Sharon Johal that a fellow cast member repeatedly referred to her as “blackie” or “the black one” to other people on the set. Johal also said she was subjected to regular impersonations of the Indian cartoon character Apu from The Simpsons, a character its creator, Hank Azaria, apologised for earlier this week, saying he believed his portrayal of Apu had contributed to “structural racism” in the US. Rae said the allegations over the past week of racist and discriminatory behaviour on the Neighbours set were a catalyst for industry-wide change to make screen workplaces safer and more inclusive. “These reports highlight that there is a fundamental issue within the power structures of our industry,” she said. “To change the screen culture there must be clear and safe processes for dealing with incidents that are transparent and ensure that all members of screen sets, including management, are held to account.” Rae said at the very minimum, Australian screen productions should be ensuring all workers were taken through anti-racism, sexual harassment and discrimination training and inductions. “This is standard practice in the US,” she said. Hii said there was a lack of understanding in the industry about the challenges actors from diverse backgrounds faced, even when they did summon the courage to call out offensive behaviour from fellow cast and crew members. “This kind of behaviour does exist in the industry and we do need to call it out, but it’s so important that when people do come forward that they don’t feel like they are alone,” he said. “It’s a really terrifying thing to do to speak your truth to power, because of that fear of a backlash or you might be blacklisted or labelled difficult and end up losing work because of it.” Hii said since graduating from Nida more than a decade ago, as an Australian of Chinese-Malaysian background he had endured more examples of “complete ignorance” than overt racism. “In audition room after audition room I was being called on to put on an Asian accent, without even any details of what type of ‘Asian’ accent’ that might be,” he said. “It’s still a case in Australia the only time [a character of non-Anglo appearance] can exist on our screens is if they’re playing some kind of a cultural stereotype.” For male actors of Asian backgrounds, Hii said that invariably meant roles as “gambling addicts or IT nerds” on Australian television. He was once invited to audition for the role of a Thai ‘lady boy’ where the transgender character was the butt of the show’s humour. A written statement issued earlier by Fremantle said the company did “not tolerate behaviour that does not align to our Anti-Discrimination, Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), Harassment & Bullying Policy” and that the company took “all complaints very seriously, investigating all allegations fairly and thoroughly”."
"It seems fitting that one of Helen McCrory’s final screen performances in a career devastatingly truncated by her death at 52 was as a barrister. In last year’s ITV drama Quiz, she played Sonia Woodley QC, hired to defend Major Charles Ingram and his wife Diana, accused of conspiring to steal the titular prize in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? through a code based on studio coughing. With a majority of viewers likely to be convinced of the Ingrams’ guilt (from media coverage of the case in 2003), McCrory as Woodley in episode three presented an alternative interpretation so engagingly and persuasively that the previous two episodes seemed to be cast into doubt. It’s unsurprising she was able to achieve this, because McCrory at her best (which was pretty much any time she stepped on stage and screen) was a defence counsel of an actor – silkily taking characters to whom audiences are unlikely to warm and making a case for them with such forensic detail and engaging presence that, by the end, the jury would be at least hung. Her last two appearances at the National Theatre were as Medea in a 2014 production of Euripides’s tragedy and Hester Collyer in a revival of Terence Rattigan’s 1952 modern classic, The Deep Blue Sea. Neither woman makes easy friends with the audience. The Greek murders her children, ex-husband and his new wife; the Englishwoman capriciously abandons a good but conformist man for an exciting but feckless lover, to be left alone, self-pitying and self-destructive. But McCrory’s eloquent, enthralling pleas for mitigation showed us the factors – Hester’s desire for sexual transcendence, Medea’s arrogant inability to accept betrayal – that forced the women to their extreme acts. Another contentious female figure, Cherie Blair – although only the most anti-Labour voices would demonise her to the level of the previous two – gave McCrory two of her most memorable movie performances, in The Queen (2006) and its sequel, The Special Relationship (2010). Screenwriter Peter Morgan wrote the Blairs as villains, but McCrory, giving a dramatic portrayal rather than an impersonation, added notes of Cherie’s high intellectual and emotional intelligence. Modern culture is so weighted towards populism that many obituaries will emphasise McCrory’s presence in a small role in the Harry Potter films, as Narcissa Malfoy. But she should be remembered as a great emotional performer – compelling not just in the Euripides and Rattigan but also in a fine 2004 Donmar theatre production of Harold Pinter’s ghostly love story, Old Times. It is tiny consolation for the shockingly young loss of an exquisitely talented actor that her work was superb to the end. Soon after Quiz last year, she gave the standout performance in David Hare’s four-part BBC2 Westminster TV thriller Roadkill, as a Conservative prime minister who combined the formidableness of Margaret Thatcher with the chilly elegance of Theresa May, without being an impression of either, but an original character. In both cases, TV critics noted that she had effortlessly stolen her episodes, despite playing relatively small roles. The comments captured her magnetic watchability, but TV and theatre audiences have had stolen from them the great shows she would have gone on to do."
"So I hear there is a new scandal involving the Australian defence force? Yeah, there’s been further developments this week regarding the investigation into war crimes allegedly committed in Afghanistan … No, no, sorry, I mean what’s this about an “inappropriate” performance at the commissioning of a new ship?  Ah sorry, twerkers in red, not lunchboxes in pink, my mistake. Yes, a dance troupe performed as part of the official commissioning ceremony for the HMAS Supply in Sydney on Sunday.  Back it up, back it up. They did what? Well, the navy has a new ship, and had a bit of a soiree to celebrate it, and seven dancers dressed in defence force-inspired hats performed on the dock. The ABC published a video of the routine on Wednesday appearing to show stony-faced dignitaries watching on, but it later turned out that they weren’t actually there for the performance. The ABC has been approached for comment about the editing of the video. Perhaps unsurprisingly the routine did not feature on the video released by the navy. That clip had lots of drone shots of the ship (funded under a $90bn defence program), seamen marching in formation, and blokes in uniform talking about “diverse and professional” teams and the ship’s “legacy”. Oh, and the governor general, David Hurley, spoke, calling it “a cause for celebration” and “a great navy day”. Talk me through this performance. Look, I don’t really know my whips from my nae naes, but basically a troupe of seven women did a little dance accompanied by some thumping beats … I’m going to say dancehall music? I think you can hear Sean Paul in there?  It really was quite a scene: there’s this hulking ship in Sydney harbour and a handful of dancers in booty shorts and berets just giving it their absolute all. The ship, for whatever reason, has a Facebook page managed by the navy, and on it there’s a 90-minute video of the ceremony (again, the dance isn’t in it). That shows the sort of stuff you’d normally expect to happen at something like this: a brass band playing the national anthem, words of commiseration for Prince Philip, and even a rendition of the Lord’s prayer. Perhaps the dance was a welcome departure from the usual stuffiness?  I mean, a bit of dancing seems way less on the nose than say, telling women not to go out alone while attractive, but I digress. Did anyone enjoy it? Those scallywags on the internet sure did. People particularly loved the ABC’s treatment of it: splicing shots of the dancers smacking their own butts with footage of the crowd, who were clutching swords and had medals pinned to their chest, soberly watching on. But there now seems some doubt about how accurate the ABC’s footage was. One person who didn’t love it though was Liberal backbencher and former soldier Phillip Thompson, who was quoted in the ABC story complaining that on the one hand, the ADF had been going “a little bit woke … we can’t afford to be doing that” while also clutching his pearls over the dancers, saying, “I don’t think it’s appropriate to be twerking.” Apparently, what the ADF needs is less krumping, more killing. Andrew Hastie, the assistant defence minister and another former soldier, was also quoted in the story as saying the military’s “core business” would always be the “application of lethal violence”. Oh. Given that other, actual scandal you mentioned at the beginning that seems … a less than ideal take. You might say that."
"When creating a supernatural crime thriller, the obvious hero wouldn’t be a middle-aged journalist. But such counterintuitive strokes are exactly what makes 1974’s short-lived Kolchak: The Night Stalker such enduring comfort food. Spawned from a popular pair of TV movies based on a then-unpublished novel by Jeffrey Grant Rice, the series already had an offbeat birth. The premise itself follows suit, tracking the mostly nocturnal exploits of Chicago wire-service reporter Carl Kolchak. Donning his signature straw hat as a humble everyman touch, Kolchak faces off against outlandish adversaries ranging from vampires and werewolves to more obscure creatures gleaned from folklore. Kolchak’s salty, quip-ready charm is all down to Hollywood veteran Darren McGavin, who’s best known for playing father to Candice Bergen’s Murphy Brown and Adam Sandler’s Billy Madison. Aged 52 at the time – and reprising the title role from those TV movies – McGavin is the biggest draw here, attacking these pulpy midnight-movie tales with a determination that actually makes journalists seem almost cool. In any other show he would be a faded cop, but the backdrop of mundane journalism allows for a lot of (now quite timely) questioning of what becomes news and what doesn’t. In another twist on the usual formula, there’s no love interest in sight for our downtrodden hero, who’s loathed by local police and barely tolerated in his own workplace. Yet the show is a wincing pleasure to watch, between its low-budget 70s scrappiness and its resistance to any satisfying closure. Kolchak carries a camera with him everywhere but his photos are always either taken, destroyed or otherwise prevented from public consumption. He abandons his proper assignments to pursue more uncanny leads, but those reports never actually make it to the wire service. Instead, he dictates conclusions to himself via tape recorder at the end of each episode. Every week Kolchak is right back where he started, chasing some new threat without reward. He never tires of his Sisyphean task, glued to his police-band radio and always ready to impersonate an authority figure. Kolchak is what we’d call a conspiracy theorist today, and Night Stalker was a key influence for The X-Files: cue the fringe-dwelling believer who never gives up. One of that show’s producers helmed a disastrous Kolchak reboot in 2005, and McGavin’s final TV credits were for playing a Kolchak-esque guest across two episodes of The X-Files. The rebooted X-Files paid even more explicit tribute to the character in the 2016 episode Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster. As for the monsters, they range from killer robots and Aztec mummies to shapeshifting animals and a near-immortal Jack the Ripper. But the best creatures give us a glimpse into the culture behind them, with Kolchak consulting experts in specific cultural lore to gain the upper hand. For all the potential absurdity of a light-hearted horror series, the show has real writerly pedigree: Sopranos creator David Chase and Oscar-winning filmmaker Robert Zemeckis both got their start here, while revered author Richard Matheson (I Am Legend) penned the novel-to-movie adaptation that sparked the series. The show was cancelled after just one season, and its final episode (The Sentry) offers no trace of resolution, though it does feature a laughable lizard costume that proves the old adage about not showing too much when aiming for scares. (Something that the show otherwise handles quite well.) A character running on sheer persistence, Kolchak now lives on in comics and novels still being produced for a loyal cult audience. That’s exactly how it should be for Kolchak: always on the hunt and never any closer to success. Just a wrung-out reporter who treats the most over-the-top occurrences (devil worshippers, swamp monsters, a prehistoric proto-human) as simply another day on a never-ending beat that’s all his own."
"The event hailed as the first major Australian music festival post-Covid has been cancelled. The New South Wales government announced on Wednesday that Bluesfest in Byron Bay would not be permitted to go ahead over Easter. The state’s health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he had signed a public health order cancelling the festival, which was supposed to commence on Thursday and run through to Monday. The move follows tighter restrictions being placed on parts of northern NSW as a new locally acquired case of Covid-19 was detected. Hazzard said a number of infectious Queensland travellers attended various venues in the Byron Bay area in recent days, with one traveller infecting a local man in his 20s at the Byron Beach hotel on the evening of Friday 26 March. On Monday, the minister had ordered Bluesfest ticket holders from the greater Brisbane area not to attend the festival’s opening day, as the region including Brisbane, Ipswich, Moreton Bay, Logan and Redlands prepared to enter a three-day lockdown. “This [cancellation] action is being taken to minimise the risk of the highly infectious Covid-19 variant of concern being transmitted in the local area, as well as across states and territories,” Hazzard said on Wednesday. “The cancellation of Bluesfest is disappointing for ticket holders and event organisers, however, while urgent investigations and contact tracing are ongoing, NSW Health is adopting a cautious approach to keep everyone safe.” Hazzard acknowledged the effort the Bluesfest team and its director, Peter Noble, had put into making the festival a Covid-safe event. As many as 15,000 people were expected to attend the five-day festival, which was to have featured performances by Jimmy Barnes, Ocean Alley, Kasey Chambers, Tash Sultana and Kate Ceberano, among others. Hazzard urged ticket holders to support Bluesfest by holding on to their tickets and waiting for details of the festival’s rescheduling. Noble said he was “heartbroken that Covid-19 has spread into our local community”. “We really wanted to be at the forefront of the return of live music at pre-Covid-19 level,” he said in a statement. “We feel deeply for everybody affected, the fans, the artists, and the hard-working Bluesfest team. But in the end, the health of our community must come first. We will be having discussions regarding Bluesfest postponement and will update everybody soon.” Noble said patrons would be contacted by Moshtix directly “once we have an update on how to proceed”."
"Ruby Rose spent much of her childhood travelling around Australia with her mother, an aspiring artist, trying to make ends meet. They were poor, but they were unstoppable, says Rose. Her mother had sold their TV, so there were no dreams of becoming the Hollywood action star she is now, nor the model, presenter, DJ, VJ and campaigner she has been over the years. When Rose was a child, she just wanted to write. “I wanted to write a book for kids that were my age. I just wanted to have a way to communicate and speak to kids like me, who didn’t have someone,” she says, over Zoom. “I was just this kid who had no friends, who was super unpopular, got bullied and beaten up at school, and was like: ‘I’m going to be a famous writer.’” The book hasn’t happened yet, but Rose has undoubtedly helped kids who identify, like she does, as gay or gender-fluid. Since the 2014 release of her passion project, Break Free, a personal short film in which she explores gender roles, Rose has helped kickstart conversations about non-binary and gender-fluid identities. Her role in Orange Is the New Black brought her distinctive androgyny to the fore, challenging more traditional understandings of sexuality; her casting as Batwoman made her the first gay superhero character in a TV series. Even now, starring in action films such as the recently released SAS: Red Notice, her presence in the mainstream as a gender-fluid lesbian feels subversive and important. But that visibility cost her dearly as a child. Rose was born in Melbourne in 1986, the only child of Katia Langenheim, a 20-year-old single mother. Langenheim was an artist, studying for her master’s, often with Rose sitting on her lap. The two left Rose’s father when she was two years old, and, after a period spent sharing a room (with their cat) at her maternal grandparents’ home in Melbourne, they were offered a church house at reduced rent in a nearby parish (“a really nice house, considering we were poor”). Many of Rose’s earliest memories are of struggling with her gender identity. “I loved being with all the boys, and sort of saw myself as one of the boys,” she says. When sports classes were split up on gender lines, she couldn’t understand why she had to play with the girls. At home, she’d experiment with making her physical appearance more masculine, slicking back her hair like Superman and flexing in the mirror. She also bound her breasts with bandages. “For a long time, I thought there was something a bit wrong with me, or that I wasn’t the gender I was meant to be,” she says. “It took years, but eventually, I came to a place where I went: ‘OK, I think I’m just very androgynous and very in tune with the masculine energy.’” Rose came out as a lesbian at 12, to a fully supportive mother. “She knew anyway,” she says. Her school peers were less supportive. She was an out lesbian, sometimes shaved her head and came from a poor family with a single mother – plus she had started modelling. All of this made her a target. “It was horrendous,” says Rose. She was verbally and physically abused, socially excluded. “We hate Ruby” was written on the toilet walls. As an introverted teenager she hid in the library, waiting for school to end. At the swimming pool, other girls would accuse her of looking at them in the changing rooms, so she stopped going. “It was little bullying moments like that, that just made me feel like I couldn’t be myself.” Some of the teachers tried to protect Rose. Her German teacher sent her to Germany for a few months on an exchange programme, usually reserved for the top four students. (“I was not in the top four!”) But one bullying incident was so bad it finally convinced Rose’s mother to let her move school. “I was hospitalised and then was out of school for about five days,” says Rose. “I got beaten up by about four girls and one guy in front of about 50 people. They hit me in the head with metal chairs at a cafe, and they threw things at me. They punched me. I ended up with lacerations, big bruises, concussion and also … just how much that horrifies your soul, your spirit. I’d been bullied a lot, but not to this degree where I was worried for my life.” Rose wanted to press charges – aggravated assault and grievous bodily harm – but was advised against doing so. Her mother didn’t have the means for a lengthy legal battle and was also worried about the sustained impact on her daughter’s mental health (Rose has struggled with mental health issues her whole life – including suicide attempts when she was as young as 12). She still receives messages from people who witnessed the attack. Some apologise for not intervening. One described the nightmares they still have about it. In 2003, Rose came second in a modelling competition for an Australian teen magazine. She was a reluctant model; as a child, her mother would put her in a high ponytail and take her to casting auditions. “I never wanted to do modelling ever. Never, never, never,” she says, laughing.  For her first gig, an artificial grass advert, she was paid about $1,000. “I hated it. But it made money. We needed it, we counted on that money.” What she hated most was her appearance being constantly criticised. It brought out her rebellious streak. If they criticised her tattoos, she’d want more. If they commented on her shaved head she’d dye it pink. “I wasn’t anti-modelling, I was anti being told that I had to look a certain way, and that how I looked wasn’t good enough. If anything it just made me kind of bolder, stronger. I had a bit of a problem with authority.” Rose’s first tattoo was not the usual teenage act of rebellion though, but part of a bargain with her mother. When Rose came back from Germany with a tongue-piercing, her mother – concerned that they didn’t have money for dental treatment – offered to get her a tattoo if she removed it. “She let me do that, because she wanted me to own my body,” says Rose. The tattoo was a Celtic rose design – a “lower-back tramp stamp” she now seems embarrassed about. “She said she felt like all the bullying and attacking was giving me a lack of boundaries. What’s mine? How do I get to own myself again? It was a good idea and very sweet. It did make me feel stronger and tougher.” After school, Rose attended an acting course at Victorian College of the Arts, which her family helped pay for. She worked multiple jobs (including bar work and modelling) while studying and auditioning. And it was while she was working as a manager at a call centre that she got life-changing news. “I was on the phone to some guy who was complaining, telling me I was never going to amount to anything because I wouldn’t give him a credit on his account.” Her other phone rang. It was MTV about her audition to be a VJ and presenter (part of the audition involved downing 100 shots of beer in 100 minutes). “I answer it, and they’re like: ‘Hey, you’re moving to Sydney!’” She accepted immediately, walked out and left her angry caller on hold. Rose started at MTV in 2007 and quickly established herself as a household name in Australia, hosting shows such as Australia’s Next Top Model. She wanted to act, but had become too prominent as a TV presenter in her home country to be taken seriously in character. After she moved to the US, she struggled for two years to land an agent or manager, let alone a role. “They all just wanted me to do reality TV. They were saying: ‘We don’t have a reality TV show with a gay woman yet. It would be huge.’” With four months left on her US visa, Rose produced and released Break Free, a short personal film in which she transforms from a feminine to masculine appearance. In two weeks it was viewed more than 5m times. Today it’s been viewed more than 54m times. Is it the project she is most proud of? “I would say so,” she says. “I was very proud of it at the time, and proud of people coming up to me in the street and writing to me about what it meant to them. Now we’re almost seven years on, I’m extremely proud of it. Because not only did it open up so many doors, but it also started so many conversations.” Yet while these conversations have brought greater acceptance and understanding of transgender, non-binary and gender-fluid identities, there has also been increased hostility over the years. “I think people are scared of things they don’t understand,” says Rose. “That’s just part of human nature. Unless that person is in a position where they’re actually going to affect the way that people live, then I don’t have the bandwidth to give my energy to caring about the fact that this person doesn’t understand. I don’t even have an issue with the fact that they have an issue. I’m still confused as to why they’re so completely enveloped in this phobia, fear, anger, rage, whatever it is, and why they get so fired up about it.” The success of Break Free led to Rose’s casting as the seductive inmate Stella Carlin in Orange Is the New Black, and since then she has moulded herself into a modern action star, with roles in the John Wick, xXx and Resident Evil franchises. Most recently she starred in SAS: Red Notice as the film’s villain, a psychopathic mercenary. In 2018, Rose made headlines when she was cast as Batwoman. In May last year, after one series, Rose announced she would be leaving the show. When filming stopped across Hollywood last year, Rose found herself wrestling with some of life’s big questions: “Do I need to think about what else I want to do in life?” Maybe one day she will fulfil her childhood dream and write a book for children struggling with their identity. What advice would she give them now?“The path that you’re meant to be on is going to be the path that was designed for you – whoever you are, at your core, and whoever you feel that you are one day to the next. It’s allowed to change, and it’s allowed to be fluid. You’re allowed to be unsure, and you’re allowed to have all those feelings. It’s really not anyone else’s business. No one else can tell you what or who you are. All the answers that you’re looking for are inside of you.” SAS: Red Notice is available on Sky Cinema now. In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and ChildLine is on 0800 1111. In the US, Mental Health America is available on 800-273-8255.

"No matter how much changes in an individual episode of Matt Groening’s animated juggernaut, everything remains the same at Springfield Elementary. This educational Neverland forever acts as a satire on the state of American public schooling, all funding crises and underhand testing tactics. Cool glass of Malk, anyone? A sunny corner of North Carolina is where the euphoria of team sport takes place: for the tumultuous teens who play for the Ravens basketball team and the cheerleaders. Nowhere in the show is the thrill and promise of high school better expressed than on the court itself, a gladiatorial ring that defines the prestige of its students. The definitive codification of the modern American high school experience, North Shore delineates and crystallises the cliques that have become a staple of fictional schools. The Plastics, attempts to make “fetch” happen, and the nutritional content of butter have all become pop culture touchstones since Mean Girls’ release in 2004. Notwithstanding a confusing move from Rochdale to Greenock, the drama’s ordinary exterior belies the neverending drama that plays out inside. Plotlines burst with pregnancies, alcohol addiction and extreme violence – and that’s just the staff. That said, the school is also full of students striving through adversity. There was always something special about the cosy communal spaces and sweeping grounds, but the day-to-day normalcy of Hogwarts is what’s spellbinding: arithmancy instead of maths; muggle studies in place of sociology. Teenage angst housed in a magical setting. Built in 1898 as a grand hotel, the real-life Stadium High School in Tacoma, Washington sets the stage for this high school reimagining of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew. And yes, its sports stadium is where Heath Ledger serenades Julia Stiles. In a short space of time, Netflix’s high school drama has developed cult status. Filmed mostly in idyllic Welsh countryside, its school is a quirky balance of rundown English state schooling and glossy Americana. With a former university building providing a striking backdrop, the show evokes John Hughes movies spliced with The Inbetweeners’ most embarrassing moments. Brought back to life in 2007, St Trinian’s cannily contrasts the boarding school’s austere facade with its boisterous life behind closed doors. Yes, there’s the occasional member of Girls Aloud and two versions of Rupert Everett, but also a science lab doubling as a vodka distillery and ample space to plan an intricate bank heist. Slaughterhouse takes the ugliest aspects of English public schools and ramps them up to demonic proportions in Crispian Mills’s 2018 comedy horror. With an imposing example of upper-class largesse as a canvas, the film gamely caricatures the traditions and rituals that underpin private schools, including an eccentrically unhinged turn from Michael Sheen as the school’s headmaster, the Bat. Set by an eerie, abandoned stretch of railway, the gothic Academy is built on the principle of sacred geometry, providing an interlaced collection of perfectly proportioned pentagonal rooms. The school’s satanic history is etched into every one of those spaces; so, not an especially carefree schooling experience."
"Born in 1975 in Cookstown, Northern Ireland, poet and novelist Nick Laird attended the University of Cambridge before working in law for six years. In 2005, he published his first collection of poems, To a Fault, and his first novel, Utterly Monkey. Since then, he has won numerous awards for his writing, including the Somerset Maugham award, the Geoffrey Faber Memorial prize and the Eric Gregory award. He lives in London with his wife, Zadie Smith, and their two children. Laird and Smith’s children’s book debut, Weirdo (Puffin, £12.99), illustrated by Magenta Fox, is published on 15 April. Arlo Parks, Collapsed in Sunbeams The title is taken from a line in one of my wife’s novels, though I’m not listening to it because of that. I love the whole summery vibe and Parks’s almost bored-sounding voice. Plus she has a convincing way with a conversational lyric. And that reminds me: the French musician Mickaël Mottet recently sent me his new album, Glover’s Mistake, which borrows a title of my own [novel from 2009]. It was bristling with humour and memorable hooks. Talking Politics I love David Runciman’s podcast, which tends to give a historically informed and global view of local events. A Cambridge academic, he has a great depth of knowledge and a lovely, free-flowing mind. His frequent co-host Helen Thompson is also a professor of politics and it’s a relief to find people speaking reasonably and rationally about complex and nuanced events. Runciman has now released a spin-off podcast, History of Ideas, in which he discusses thinkers from Hobbes to Frederick Douglass, and it’s also wonderful. It’s like being back at university but you can also be in the bath. The Dog House, Channel 4 I have a pug who’s 15 that I push around Brent in a pram at the minute, since she can’t really walk anymore. Dogs are one of the few uncomplicated goods in the world. The Dog House is perfect viewing for me and my kids, featuring abandoned dogs being rehoused with humans who often have complicated stories of their own. We’re making our way through the second season now and we’re hoping that Rocco the jack russell and Trinity the lurcher find homes soon. Capernaum (dir Nadine Labaki) The war in Syria entered its 10th year in March. More than half a million people have been killed or are missing, more than 2 million have been injured and at least 12 million – half of Syria’s prewar population – have fled their homes and become refugees. Capernaum isn’t directly about the war: it’s about a Syrian refugee child living in Beirut in Lebanon, but it shows a sliver of the chaos and heartache caused by it. It’s directed and co-written by Nadine Labaki and it’s astonishingly powerful. It came out in 2018 but I watched it for the first time a month or so ago and I’m still thinking about it. Zoom plays Early on in lockdown, some friends and I started a Zoom play-reading group on Sunday nights. Somehow, we’ve now been at it for a year. Each week, a different participant is the director and chooses the play, assigns parts and reads the stage directions. We’ve done everything from Beckett to Caryl Churchill, but a recent highlight was Will Arbery’s excoriating examination of the ideology of the religious right wing in America, Heroes of the Fourth Turning, which I’d seen in production last year. We’re currently halfway through Will Eno’s biting and hilarious The Realistic Joneses. The Thunder Mutters (ed Alice Oswald) My dad died last week of Covid in Antrim Area hospital. Because of the restrictions, I had to say goodbye on the phone. Even the chapel at the crematorium was closed. We weren’t able to have a wake or bring the body home. The only book I’d brought in my bag to Ireland was this wonderful anthology and I was consoled – or at least abstracted for a bit – by reading poets as diverse as Francis Ponge, Marianne Moore and Michael Drayton, although I was most glad to have Rilke’s The Eighth Elegy in my pocket (in Stephen Mitchell’s brilliant translation): “Yet in the alert, warm animal there lies/ the pain and burden of an enormous sadness.” Josh Cohen, How to Live. What to Do This is a really beautiful book. He’s a psychoanalyst and a literature professor and here he imagines characters from great novels as psychoanalytic subjects, walking into his consulting room. Each character represents a different age or stage of life: Jane Eyre for childhood, Marianne and Connell [from Normal People] for first love, Gatsby for ambition, Rabbit Angstrom for old age, and so on… As you read their lives, you read your own. It’s a genuinely therapeutic read – it takes your particular sorrows and by sharing them seems to halve them. You feel better afterwards."
"The American film-maker Garrett Bradley premiered her first nonfiction feature, Time, at the Sundance film festival last year, where she became the first black woman to win the directing award. The documentary, about a mother campaigning for her husband’s release from prison, has since received multiple accolades. Before Garrett Bradley premiered her documentary Time, which has received a slew of nominations over the past 14 months including for the Oscar for best documentary, she didn’t have much experience with awards ceremonies. She went to the Gotham awards in 2014 with her debut feature, Below Dreams, but she didn’t win that night. Even so, the event was “beautiful”, she recalls. “There were lots of tables with gorgeous flowers and all different types of silverware, and people I was used to seeing in magazines.” With Time, which follows an African-American family dealing with the trauma and injustices of long-term incarceration, the 35-year-old has been negotiating an entirely different kind of awards experience. From her couch in California, she has logged into 10 different events including the National Society of Film Critics Awards and the Gotham awards, where Time won best documentary. (Bradley also won best director in the US documentary category at Sundance, in February 2020, becoming the first black woman to pick up that award.) “It’s a bit like a video game,” she says of the online ceremonies. “Sometimes you’ll see an interface that has different tables, and you’ll be jumping from one table to the next. And the funny thing is, you don’t know who’s going to be there. You click it and then you’re just in it, and there’s no getting out of that virtual table. But it’s kind of fun. You give in to the lack of control and look for new ways of finding social grace on the internet.” The 11 awards Time has collected so far have been personally meaningful for Bradley, the daughter of New York artists who studied religion before becoming a full-time filmmaker. But she’s at pains to emphasise the collective nature of the project, sharing the awards not just with the film crew but also with the Richardson family of New Orleans who trusted her to tell their story. “To see that we’ve offered an entry point into the conversation around incarceration has been huge for all of us,” she says. “This is not a niche issue: this is a majority issue that affects the majority of people in America.”  Worst thing about an awards ceremony?The rules. You can only get up at a certain time, you have to wear your outfit for a long period of time. It would be nice if it could be a bit more freeform. Where do you keep your awards?Right now they’re all in a suitcase. I’ve had the same suitcase since 2019. So I just carry them around with me. What do you look for in an awards outfit?I dressed up once [for an online ceremony] and it was really fun, because I only had to dress up from the waist up – below I was wearing sweatpants and no one knew. It was great."
"Before she died, the actor Helen McCrory repeatedly urged her teenage children to be courageous and not sad about her death, her husband, Damian Lewis, has said. In a moving tribute to the Peaky Blinders star, Lewis said: “She’s left our beautiful children, Manon and Gully, too early, but they have been prepared for life.” Writing in the Sunday Times, Lewis said: “She has exhorted us to be courageous and not afraid. As she said repeatedly to the children: ‘Don’t be sad, because even though I’m about to snuff it, I’ve lived the life I wanted to.’” McCrory, who was also known for her roles in the films The Queen, The Special Relationship and the Harry Potter franchise, died of cancer on Friday at the age of 52. She swore her friends to secrecy about the disease as she underwent treatment, according to Carrie Cracknell, who directed McCrory in a 2014 production of Medea. Lewis, himself an actor, acknowledged that keeping her condition private had prompted an “outpouring of grief and shock”. He noted that the grief for McCrory had not been eclipsed by the funeral of Prince Philip. “On a weekend when the papers, rightly, will be paying their respects to the Duke of Edinburgh, thousands of others around the world have been remembering m’Duchess, my Little One, royalty in her own right.” Lewis said he wanted to focus on his wife’s professional and personal achievements. “Helen was an even more brilliant person than she was an actress,” he said, describing her a “meteor in our life”. Lewis wrote: “Her nickname to many was Dame Helen (apologies, Dame Helen), and although we’ll never know now whether that would have become a reality, I think secretly, we do know.” Lewis said McCrory was “fiercely proud of being an artist, an actress”. He said she was proudest of her work on stage. McCrory had said “doing theatre is what made my heart sing,” Lewis recalled. Sam Mendes, who directed McCrory in an acclaimed production of Uncle Vanya, praised her “explosive energy” on stage. Writing in the Guardian, Mendes said he had asked McCrory to play the role of Sonya, but she had other ideas. “She told me she should be playing Yelena – the other young female role – and then proceeded to spend the next hour telling me exactly why. She left the room with the part. This has never happened to me before or since … She was clearly already halfway to giving a superb performance, I simply had to get out of the way and let her complete the job. Which, of course, she did – with utter brilliance.” Lewis recalled that the actor Lauren Bacall had mistakenly praised her for performing Sonya, played by Emily Watson, after a show of the production in New York. When Bacall apologised for the mistake, McCrory said: “That’s all right Ms Hepburn, I’m glad you enjoyed the show.” Lewis added: “Lauren Bacall threw her head back and laughed and bellowed. ‘You’re my kind of dame, let’s go out.’ And off they went into the night.” Lewis said that in the weeks before her death his wife had talked about his future relationships with women, saying that “love isn’t possessive”. “She said to us from her bed: ‘I want Daddy to have girlfriends, lots of them, you must all love again, love isn’t possessive, but you know, Damian, try at least to get through the funeral without snogging someone,’” he said."
"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all The phrase “The Simpsons did it first” gets thrown around a lot. But Matt Groening’s sitcom about a volatile nuclear family – now 700 episodes in and recently renewed until at least 2023 – was a genuine trailblazer. In 1990, its second season premiere received more than 30 million US viewers, proving a brightly coloured animated TV series with whip-smart writing could attract mature eyeballs in primetime. If their children liked it too, all the better. Over the past three decades, hearing grownup jokes in kiddie cartoon form has become much less of a novelty. The Simpsons and subsequent long-runners such as King of the Hill, South Park and Family Guy made animation aimed at adults a familiar TV niche. The last decade has seen an explosion of new series, some with fresh approaches to the genre, some not so much. Have we reached market saturation? Perhaps streaming is to blame. Thirsty services have licensed existing titles to beef up content libraries while also ordering new shows to bolster their brand. In the Netflix era, this means successes might hit hard and fast (such as the bittersweet celebrity tailspin BoJack Horseman) but failures can be far more visible (fratty basketball comedy Hoops, cancelled after one season). Late-arriving streamers such as Apple TV+ and HBO Max have followed Netflix’s trigger-happy lead; wacky commissions, such as a mature origin story for Scooby-Doo’s Velma, are announced seemingly every week. Even Covid hasn’t slowed things down, since animation production pipelines are easier to pandemic-proof and remain substantially cheaper than live-action filming. The result is an abundance of adult animation that can feel overwhelming. In such a fractured media landscape, it can be hard to tell your Duncanville (a coming-of-age story co-created by Amy Poehler) from your Central Park (a star-studded NYC-set musical on Apple TV+). To stand out in such a packed field, creators are taking big swings and using the familiarity and flexibility of animation to tackle previously taboo subjects. BoJack is the poster horse for this new wave, deftly exploring depression, addiction and even dementia. Big Mouth, another Netflix standout, takes an unfiltered look at adolescence – including menstruation, masturbation and other puberty minefields – in ways that a live-action show would never dare. In content-hungry 2021, streamers seem prepared to sign off on almost anything – all in the name of creating soul-nourishing art, of course, but also perhaps spurred by the unpredicted breakout of Adult Swim’s sci-fi hit Rick and Morty, an odd-couple comedy of blowtorch existentialism that has inspired a rabid worldwide fanbase since debuting in 2013. Things are unlikely to decelerate any time soon. Netflix and CBS have established in-house animation studios to reduce outsourcing costs while ramping up production. Disney, the biggest media beast of all, recently launched a new adult animation division to consolidate their many recent acquisitions and launch “dozens” of additional projects. But don’t have a cow, man: we’ll just have to exercise some critical judgment to find the good stuff. "
"Trevor Noah weighed in Wednesday evening on the war of words between corporations and the GOP over Georgia’s new restrictive voting law. The Republican-backed measure, part of a wave of bills restricting voting rights after record turnout propelled Joe Biden to the White House and flipped the Senate, shortens the window for absentee voting, curtails access to ballot access for predominantly minority voters in urban counties, and makes offering food or water to voters waiting in line a misdemeanor. In response, several corporations, including Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, as well as Google, Microsoft and Facebook, have publicly denounced the law, drawing the ire of the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, who this week warned businesses of “serious consequences” if they continued to voice opposition to the measure. It was “appropriate” for corporations to donate money to politicians through political action committees, McConnell told reporters, but “taking a position on a highly incendiary issue like this and punishing the community or state because you don’t like a particular law that passed? I just think it’s stupid.” Noah slow-capped for McConnell’s hypocrisy (the Kentucky senator has received $4.3m in corporate donations over the past five years). “‘Keep your mouth shut and hand over the money’ — that’s literally what bank robbers say,” the Daily Show host explained. “For real, Mitch McConnell does not give a fuck, man. He just lays out the game for you, straight. “This is especially hilarious coming from Mitch McConnell,” Noah added, “because don’t forget – he helped create the situation today where politicians are so dependent on big business for campaign spending that they basically let companies write all of the laws. “But you see, Mitch, after you spent decades helping companies intervene in politics, you can’t now be upset that companies want to now intervene in politics,” he concluded. “The monster you created is coming after you! Just like how you enabled Trump, and then he came after you.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert provided an update on the scandal he’s deemed “Gaetz-Gaete” – the federal investigation of the Florida congressman and stalwart Trump ally Matt Gaetz for alleged sex trafficking and an inappropriate relationship with a teenage girl. Gaetz has denied wrongdoing, but the New York Times revealed on Tuesday that during Trump’s final days in office, he’d personally requested a blanket pardon. Gaetz “wanted a pre-emptive pardon for any illegal activity he’s ever done – like innocent people do”, Colbert joked, “and he had reason to believe that he might get that pardon because of his close relationship with the former president”. But White House lawyers viewed the request as a nonstarter that would set a bad precedent. “Do you know how shady you have to be for number 45’s lawyers to go, ‘no that’s a bad look – now if you’ll excuse me, I just farted on camera, my head is leaking and I’m late for my press conference outside the crematorium dildo shop,” Colbert joked, referring to the disgraced Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Despite the ongoing investigation, Gaetz is slated to speak at an event hosted by Women for America First, a group of “diehard Maga loyalists” who helped organize the pro-Trump rally on 6 January that devolved into the attack on the Capitol. Gaetz’s speech will be part of an “Americana”-themed dinner featuring “BBQ, Boots & Bluegrass” – “not to be confused with Gaetz’s usual theme of molly, minors and mandatory minimums”, Colbert quipped. Amid criticism, the group defended the decision to book Gaetz and called him a “fearless leader in DC”. “Yes, Gaetz fears nothing!” Colbert said. “Except the parents of whoever he’s texting.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also reacted to the NYT’s report that Gaetz asked Trump for a blanket pardon. “That’s not suspicious,” the host deadpanned. “You know you haven’t done anything wrong when you check in with the president to ask for a pardon in case you happen to get accused of a sex crime somewhere down the line.” The White House considered the request a nonstarter, “which is saying a lot considering Donald Trump once wanted to nuke a hurricane”, Kimmel said. As for the reported reasoning that pardoning Gaetz would set a “bad precedent”, the White House “were only interested in setting terrible precedents”, Kimmel joked. “But ‘bad precedent’ should be the title of Trump’s autobiography.” According to the New York Times, Trump’s advisers have talked him out of a full-throated defense of Gaetz, “which is sad because Matt Gaetz really was the son Donald Trump never had, even though he had a couple,” Kimmel remarked."
"I’m a comedian, writer, singer and a sensual product of the digital age. My latest show Doggo looks at my relationships with the animals in my life, whereas this list is all about my relationship to memes. Instead of tucking into my enormous pile of writing work, I spend hours a day looking at alluring internet garbage. Will I make any effort to change? Absolutely not. When someone asks the question “where do you see yourself in 10 years?”, this is the answer: I am all of these women. It is also the answer to the question “what are you doing this weekend?” and “why did you miss your last job interview?” The joy and sisterhood is contagious. There was a coordinated effort in creating this meme. Calendars were synchronised, OH&S assessments were completed, wine was consumed. Well done to these women and these women alone. No other piece of media captures the year 2020 like this. I am obsessed with the silliness of Melbourne sketch comedy duo Hot Department. Everything they make is pure genius that makes me wee my pants. Something about the jarring Tarantino reference at the end just speaks to me. A must watch for my fellow anxious babes. A timeless classic. This is what happens at the intersection of technology and comedic innovation. My siblings and I spent a whole week quoting this video when we were teenagers, and my parents LOVED IT. This video is a time capsule of what we would do to pass the time in the 2010s. I shall describe this to my grandchildren like grandparents describe the moon landing. Jordan Raskopoulos shutting down bigots is one of the greatest joys in this world. It’s not only the theatricality, but the effort involved in making the little floating gifs that make me particularly happy. I love her. Chicago-based drag king and winner of Alaska’s Drag Queen of the Year pageant in 2021, Tenderoni is incredible. This video magically transports me back to 2007. A young Alice, armed with a side fringe and little vest, would crank that with the best of them. Also, Christmas. An iconic moment from Sofía Vergara. Not only iconic, but poetic. Insightful. Bold. Daring. Hang this in MONA. It is a reminder that life and death are fragile constructs. That looks can be deceiving. That we are all stardust in the great infinity. Friedrich Nietzsche walked so Sofía Vergara could run. I am so curious about this man. How sincere is he in this moment? Does he truly not know what cranberry juice is? Does he suspect that women are engaging in a juice-based conspiracy against mankind? I have so many questions. RIP Kimye. I’ll be the first to admit that my Kardashians knowledge is limited, but this rules. The writing was well and truly on the wall from this moment. At least there will be no arguments over the pool in the divorce proceedings. The Law & Order theme song rivals Imagine, Rhapsody in Blue and Beethoven’s Fifth for the greatest song of all time. This TikTok encapsulates the pure joy in the studio on the faithful day they recorded it, to hilarious affect. Another Christmas-themed one for the list. Often I have found myself asking, “Where are my background singers?” Patti remains a consummate professional under trying circumstances and that is what makes her a legend."
"Three weeks into the trial of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd last May, widespread protests broke out again in the city of Minneapolis after police shot and killed another unarmed black man. On Sunday, an officer in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis, killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a traffic stop after the officer mistook her gun for her Taser, according to police. “You have got to be fucking kidding me,” said Trevor Noah on Monday evening. “A man was killed at a traffic stop because the police officer mixed up their gun and their Taser? Is that even supposed to be a legitimate excuse? Like we’re supposed to watch that and be like, ‘Ah, OK, one time I used sugar instead of salt so I can relate.’ “I’m not saying that tragic mistakes will never happen,” the Daily Show host continued, “but what I am saying is that maybe if the police weren’t so quick to draw any weapon then maybe people wouldn’t die because of a mix-up from Officer Urkel over here.” It’s also not the only example of anti-black police brutality once again making headlines this week. Noah also pointed to body-cam footage of white officers from Windsor, Virginia, harassing a black army lieutenant in uniform and pepper-spraying him at a traffic stop for their failure to see his temporary plates, which were visible in the officers’ own body-cam footage. The lieutenant, Caron Nazario, who is suing the officers for civil rights violations in federal court, attempted to de-escalate the situation by pulling over at a well-lit gas station, hanging his hands out the window, and relaying clearly that he was frightened. One of the officers responded: “You should be scared!” “He knew to get to a gas station so that he would have decent lighting for the encounter,” Noah repeated. “Just think about that for a moment: police brutality has forced everyday black Americans to become lighting experts. “Please don’t forget: this is how cops treated one of the troops, while he was wearing his uniform,” Noah concluded. “Not a hoodie, not baggy pants, so what’s the excuse this time, huh? If a black man in military uniform can’t get humane treatment from the police, then what chance does every other black person in America have? “At this point, black people should just start singing the Star-Spangled Banner when they get pulled over, and then maybe, just maybe, the cops will be like, ‘Well, I don’t want to pepper-spray the anthem, what do I do?’” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also addressed the killing of Wright after an officer in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, mistook her handgun for her Taser. “It’s dangerous when a policeman can’t tell if you’re holding a gun. It’s insane when they can’t tell if they’re holding a gun,” Colbert said. “Now you might think, ‘Hey, just don’t try to flee and nothing bad will happen to you,’ and you would think wrong,” he added, shifting to Nazario’s harassment in Windsor, Virginia. last December after he was pulled over for not having proper license plates. His temporary plates were still visible in the body-cam footage, however, “so maybe instead of giving police departments enough funding for tanks, they should get enough funding for reading glasses”, Colbert joked. Later in his monologue, Colbert checked in on so-called “Gaetz-Gaete”, the sprawling sex scandal that has engulfed the Florida congressman and Trump ally Matt Gaetz. He is under federal investigation for sex trafficking and an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl; last week, the Daily Beast revealed that Gaetz allegedly paid for sexual services via the app Venmo, with said transactions visible in his public feed. “You’re doing crimes on an app? How dumb are these guys?” Colbert said. “It’s like organizing a hit on Words with Friends.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also recapped the Gaetz saga. The Florida congressman “has been on the vanguard of Trumpism”, Meyers explained. “He’s been one of the former president’s most loyal defenders and one of the strongest advocates of turning the GOP into a megaphone for Trumpism.” Yet even the former president has shied away from coming to Gaetz’s defense amid the sex trafficking investigation, as have almost all congressional Republicans. “It’s so funny that Republicans are suddenly telling reporters how much they hate Matt Gaetz. They sound like a bunch of mean high schoolers,” Meyers said. “You can just picture Ted Cruz and Kevin McCarthy gossiping at their lockers in the congressional hallway.” Meyers also mocked the Florida man-ness of two Gaetz associates implicated in the investigation. Joel Greenberg, part of the Venmo transaction debacle, is the former Seminole county tax collector, “which is like a job out of small-town corruption Mad Libs”, Meyers joked. And then there’s Jason Pirozzolo, a marijuana entrepreneur and hand surgeon who allegedly arranged a trip to the Bahamas with Gaetz under investigation for sex trafficking. “The only way that could be a more perfectly Floridian occupation is if he added ‘owner and operator of fan boat traveling funeral parlor for kids’,” said Meyers."
"On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert opened again with outrage over the killing of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. On Sunday, officer Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the force, shot and killed 20-year-old Wright, who was unarmed, during a traffic stop after she confused her gun for her taser. “There must be some sort of design flaw in the Taser handles – or in our country, because this is not an isolated incident,” said Colbert, citing experts who said this is not the first time such a deadly mistake was made and it won’t be the last. “Why not? And why are we Tasering so many people? “I think it’s because when people here ‘Taser’, they assume it’s harmless because it’s non-lethal,” he answered. “But in fact, it’s an act of torture to force compliance. And it’s just possible that our laws are enforced too much with threats of violence for something that considers itself a free society. “In fairness to the police, they’re just using the only tools and trainings we give them,” he added. “It’s like the saying goes: if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Also, maybe let’s not give the police hammers?” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed the Food and Drug Administration’s temporary pause on distribution of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine while it investigates an exceedingly rare side-effect: out of 7m doses, six women developed a severe blood clot disorder within two weeks of receiving the vaccine. “Look, on the one hand, I get it: you don’t want the vaccine for one disease to give you another disease,” said Noah. “But on the other hand, it’s six cases out of 7m doses. You realize that means you’re more likely to get struck by lightning 10 times?” The chances of developing the blood clot side-effect from the vaccine are extremely low – less than one in a million – “but if you get coronavirus, you can get lung damage, heart damage, neurological damage, strokes, seizures, Guillain-Barre syndrome, immune disorders, erectile dysfunction and, get this, also blood clots,” Noah explained. “I think it’s impressive that Johnson & Johnson even made an effective vaccine with such a low chance of blood clots,” he added. “I mean, Pfizer and Moderna,” the other two major vaccine manufacturers in the US, are “drug companies. Johnson & Johnson makes baby shampoo. I’m surprised this shit works at all. “There is no question that this is a setback,” Noah concluded of the pause. “It’s a setback for a country that is already dealing with a shit-ton of vaccine hesitancy.” But “the US is still doing a really good job with its vaccine rollout”, he added. “Which, you have to admit, is a little unexpected. I mean, given how America handled everything else about the pandemic, I wouldn’t have been surprised if when vaccine time came around, America accidentally locked all 300m doses in the trunk of the car.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also addressed the FDA’s temporary pause of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. “Now the White House is scrambling to restore confidence in vaccines,” he said, as “public trust is already a major obstacle to achieving herd immunity”. Kimmel, in costume as a doctor, then took audience questions submitted via Facebook about the implications of the pause. “First of all, out of 7 million people who received the J&J shot, only six people had the side-effect,” he said to one who wondered if the J&J vaccine was still safe. “That means the odds are less than one in a million,” or 0.0000009 – “more zeroes than in the whole Trump family”, Kimmel joked. Johnson & Johnson and the FDA also immediately identified the side-effects – “that’s how closely they’re monitoring this”, Kimmel said, “and that should be very reassuring, because six out of seven million means getting the vaccine is safer than not getting the vaccine. You got it? Then get it.”"
"Beneath the black ceiling inside Hum Records on King Street in Newtown, John Salway spots something on the shelf under the letter “C”. “Elvis Costello must have a new album,” he says. He picks up the hard plastic square and he and his friend, Regina Safro, squint to read the fine print on the bottom of the back of the CD case. Safro hasn’t seen the album before either. Salway finds the release date and nods. “2020. I’ll likely buy that on spec.” Salway estimates that he might buy a dozen CD albums a year. Safro thinks she purchases between 10 and 20. The pair are part of an increasingly small cohort of music fans who continue to buy CDs, in a world where most new cars and computers no longer have a way to even play them. Figures to be released this week by the Australian music industry are expected to show CD album sales in Australia fell by more than 15% in 2020. Meanwhile, sales of vinyl have rocketed by more than 30%, as more new artists release on the premium format as an alternative to digital streams, and labels continue releasing collector editions of the classics. At this point it’s much more than just a nostalgia boom: industry insiders predict vinyl sales in Australia will comfortably surpass CDs this year for the first time. In the US, they hit that milestone last year; and in the UK, vinyl sales have reached a three-decade high. For Peter Thiele, owner and manager of Hum, CDs now represent only a small fraction of his turnover. Hum has been in Newtown since 2000: a local institution in an area which long ago rounded the arc of gentrification. Hum used to have other stores, but King Street is the last of the originals. “Vinyl is the big thing,” he says. “It saved us.” As Thiele speaks to the Guardian, young people wander around alone and in pairs, thumbing their way silently through the heft of vinyl. There remains, though, a cohort which steadfastly continues to buy CDs, he says. The CD shelves are a little sparse, with compilations, classic albums and newer artists. But as long as they’re still being made, he will still sell them. “It’s a bit niche,” he says. “The artists would be an older artist – things like Nick Cave. Is that old man’s music? I don’t know. He’s a bit more crossover. He’s like Bob Dylan. We sell a lot of Bob Dylan on CD. If there was a new Radiohead album, that would sell on CD.” Madonna fans. Kylie fans. They will buy everything, he says. It’s about ownership. Salway lives in Goulburn, but comes to Hum whenever he’s in Sydney visiting Safro. He’ll put a CD on if he wants to read on the balcony, or if he’s gardening. “This might sound odd, but I don’t feel like I own a song unless I have something tangible,” he says. “Even though I might make an MP3 of it, put it on a USB and play it in the car, I still like the fact that I can go back to the CD. “I like an album. I like the thought that’s gone into an album; the progression of songs, and the moment in time that the album has been created.” Safro buys vinyl, digital downloads and listens to Spotify. She rarely actually plays vinyl – it’s a bit fiddly – and Spotify does not sit well with her. “It relates to the constant on-switch of the world we live in. It’s like: Next! Next! Next! Instead of sitting back, putting on a CD, and … ” she gestures leaning back, relaxing. A graphic designer, she also likes the physicality of the artwork CDs come with. It might be a little bit more expensive than a digital download, at around $20 an album, but, “it’s some money for the artist”. It’s about more than patronage and ownership for her. “It’s the ritual as well,” she says. “I remember saving up money to go and buy your record and putting it on the turntable. It’s echoes of that.” Thiele stands in the aisle in a short-sleeved button-up shirt in a tiny floral pattern. Grey hair trimmed and neat. He streams. He downloads. He listens to vinyl, and he listens to CDs. “People say to me: ‘Sounds better on vinyl’,” he shrugs. “I go, ‘Sounds different.’ “CD quality is the best you can get, because you’ve got a master.” Physical collections – like CDs, records or books – reflect something about their owner, he says. “They tell a story about you. You don’t go, ‘Look at my phone, here’s my music collection.’ It isn’t the same thing. You go to a friend’s place and you look at what albums they have.” And it’s not just for older people. Euan Barrett-Lennard arrives at Hum with his dad. The 18-year-old carries three CD albums in his hand: Oscar Petersen, Kasumi Washington, Michael Kiwanuka. He’s into jazz. His parents have a “massive shelf with heaps of CDs”. Barrett-Lennard likes that they’re physical, that you get to know the artist rather than shuffling through a playlist. He was just talking to his dad about the sound quality; with a CD, he says “you notice all the little bits in the music”. He takes his small haul to the young uni student manning the till. Next time, when he comes to Hum, he’ll have researched more what he wanted to buy. For now, though, he doesn’t own many CDs, he says. “I’m only just starting.” "
"With sections of the construction site for Sydney’s Parramatta Powerhouse now submerged by flood water, debate has reignited over the suitability of the $915m project’s riverside location. An independent Parramatta-based flood management consultant, Steven Molino, told Guardian Australia on Monday that events over the past three days should serve as a wake-up call to the New South Wales government. “The lower parts of the Parramatta Powerhouse will go underwater … that’s just the nature of the riverside location that has been chosen,” he said. “Now it’s up to the state government to decide whether the risk is worth it – and that risk assessment has not been done.” The Parramatta River broke its banks on Saturday, flooding the path that runs alongside the museum site and inundating the ground floor of a four-level car park slated for demolition as part of the museum’s construction. It is the second time in just over a year that the proposed site for the museum has been inundated by a swollen Parramatta River during heavy rainfall. On Monday the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, rejected suggestions that flooding in the Parramatta precinct proved the location’s unsuitability for the state’s most ambitious museum project to date. “I dispute that strenuously,” she said, before handing over to the local Parramatta state MP, Geoff Lee, who said he had conducted an inspection of the affected area on Sunday. “[What] we have had is a bit of water there, but we have a 68-storey building right next to the Powerhouse [site], it is five metres up … it is not flooded,” he said, adding that any claims to the contrary were “spurious” and “absolutely misleading”. A statement issued by the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences said the museum’s design and engineering considerations would ensure that in a one-in-1,000 year flood event water would not even reach the building’s ground floor. “What the weekend demonstrates is that our new museum, Western Sydney’s first cultural institution, is positioned well above even the rarest of flood events,” said the museum trust’s president, former NSW Liberals leader Peter Collins. “The flooding we saw on the weekend wouldn’t have come within four metres of the museum entrance.” The NSW’s opposition spokesperson for the arts, Walt Secord, said the government must heed the weekend’s warning and move the site to drier ground nearby, at the Female Factory site. “This was supposed to be a one-in-1,000 year event, but it has happened twice in two years,” Secord said. “In a desperate bid to overcome the flooding problems, the Berejiklian Government has created a monstrosity on stilts. “The Powerhouse Parramatta site has now been inundated by flooding twice in less than two years, yet [the government] is continuing with this debacle of a project despite expert after expert advising against this site.” Molino, who gave evidence at the state government’s inquiry into museums last month, said the government’s much-vaunted one-in-1,000 year scenario meant that in the building’s predicted 100-year lifespan, there was a 10% chance that water was going to get into the building. “If it was an office building with just office furniture and carpets and everything, it wouldn’t matter – if it gets flooded you go down to Carpet Court and buy new carpet, you go down to Officeworks and buy new furniture – it’s all easily replaced,” he said. “But the information we have at present suggests that the electrical power supply will go out [during flooding] and the generators won’t operate the air conditioning system. So you’ll have a spike in humidity … and if you’ve got items in the collection made from paper, textiles, and even wood and some metals, [the museum’s] collection will deteriorate, be possibly irreparably damaged or even lost. “Now the decision might be made that the probability of this occurring is an acceptable risk, but no one has gone through that process.” The Infrastructure NSW-delivered project must go through such a risk assessment, but only after construction has been completed and the project reaches its occupation stage. A museum specialist and member of the Powerhouse Museum Alliance, Kylie Winkworth, said Molino’s concerns were valid. “It is odd that the condition of consent to investigate the risk of flood damages to the collection is conditioned at the occupation stage instead of prior to construction, when it should in fact have been part of the EIS [environmental impact statement],” she said. “The NSW Government will spend $1bn and not know if the building is fit for purpose and safe for collections until it is ready for occupation. “This is quite bizarre – and reckless.”"
"A year ago, spring break parties in Florida exacerbated the spread of the nascent coronavirus, as people were too late in taking seriously the risks of the pandemic. This year, the scene in Miami Beach was not much different, late-night hosts reported on Monday evening, as spring breakers let up on pandemic precautions too soon. On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah replayed footage from a weekend of packed bars and chaotic, maskless street parties in Florida, in which more than 1,000 people were arrested; in one video, a shirtless man with his face painted like a Joker stood on top of a car and rained cash down on the crowd. “Man, the Snyder cut is weird as hell,” Noah joked, then turned serious. “Let’s be clear here: Covid is not over. All right? Some random dude can’t declare the end of the pandemic by dressing up like the Joker and making it rain. It’s not a thing. Only Dr Fauci can declare the end of the pandemic by dressing up like the Joker and making it rain.” But you can’t fully blame the partiers, Noah continued. “This is what’s gonna happen after Florida’s governor called the state a ‘freedom oasis’,” he said, referring to comments by Governor Ron DeSantis. “Like, if I put a Starbucks sign above my apartment door, I can’t be mad when people show up and try to take a shit in my bathroom. But still, there’s no reason that you can’t celebrate spring break and wear a mask. “If we’ve learned anything from Miami, this is just a preview of how much everyone is gonna let loose once the pandemic is truly over,” he added. “People have been locked up for too long. Once it ends, there’s gonna be drinking and partying, hooking up with everyone – it’s gonna be so much that it’s gonna create the next worldwide virus.” In a sign of the return to somewhat normal, New York City reopened indoor fitness classes at 33% capacity, “or as it’s known by anyone who’s taken a group fitness class: what should be full capacity”, joked Stephen Colbert, who then imitated a yoga instructor: “now, exhale and shift into your downward face into a stranger’s crotch”. “Another sign things are returning to normal: sex parties are back,” the Late Show host continued, quoting a headline from the Daily Beast. “OK, the word that most surprised me in that sentence was ‘back’. Call me old sheltered grandpa but I didn’t know they were actually a thing that happened frequently enough before Covid for there to be a pent-up demand. To me, that’s like reading a headline, ‘root beer jacuzzis return’.” But these reopenings have a cost, Colbert continued, citing a rise in new coronavirus infections since states have dropped Covid restrictions. Things were “looking especially dicey” in Miami Beach, where city officials were forced to declare a state of emergency and an 8pm curfew to curtail massive spring break crowds. “Surprise, it didn’t work,” said Colbert. “Hot tip for Miami authorities: if you want young people to stop partying, don’t instate a curfew. Just invite a few dads, and that party will be over quicker than you can say ‘Sherwin Williams reward points’.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers checked in on Donald Trump’s retirement in Florida, where he has “decided to spend his time creepily shuffling around his Palm Beach resort like the ghost of a retired dentist who drowned in a water hazard on the 18th hole”. In almost all photos since he slinked away from the White House, the former president has appeared in a uniform of red hat, white polo and “slacks that seem to be rising faster than the sea level”. Meyers joked, looking like a “lost grandpa who’s supposed to be watching the kids at the mall”. “His business and finances are apparently in even worse shape,” Meyers continued, citing reports that Trump’s net worth fell by $700m during his presidency, as well as the intensification of a New York attorney general’s investigation into his tax returns and the partial closure of his Mar-a-Lago resort due to a Covid outbreak. “My God, Covid follows this guy like a rain cloud following Daffy Duck,” he joked. “His rallies, the White House, now Mar-a-Lago – he’s like a walking Covid test. If you’re ever in physical proximity to Donald Trump, you should just, you know, quarantine for two weeks just to be safe.” At least, Meyers added, it “really does perfectly capture the modern state of the GOP” that “the guy they tried to overthrow democracy for is now a financially broken ghost criminal”."

"John Oliver took on a perennial hot potato in American politics on Sunday evening: the US national debt, also known as “the world’s most boring $28tn,” he joked. The debt has long been “a complete obsession in this country” – just look at New York’s upwards-counting debt clock – and while it’s “undeniably big” and poised to expand with the trillions for coronavirus stimulus packages and the infrastructure plans unveiled by Joe Biden last week, the debt isn’t quite as ominous as conservative fearmongers would have people believe. “For decades in political ads, the debt has been portrayed as a burden that we’re placing on future generations,” the Last Week Tonight host explained. The general argument is that the federal government is “running up their credit card and that one day, the bill is going to come due” and screw over younger generations, usually represented in ads by crying babies and exhausted toddlers. Such ads, especially ones that suggest the debt is owed to China, are “wildly misleading”, Oliver said, as the majority of public debt is owned by the American investors. And “while the debt is often talked about as something that we’re running up with new spending, the truth is, before the pandemic hit, most of our debt was the result of long, steady growth in programs that we long ago committed to, like Medicare and other entitlements,” he explained. In other words, brick-and-mortar programs for government spending, which underscored an important point: “Going into debt can actually be a good investment for the country,” Oliver said. “Essentially, as economists will tell you, the key question is: are you spending money on the right things?” The host then offered a quick lesson on American debt politics. “Republicans love to argue that government should be run like a business, but tend to conveniently forget that some extremely valuable companies got that way in part because they had long periods where they spent a shitload more than they took in,” he explained. As president, Ronald Reagan was the self-styled hero of fiscal restraint, “but that story just doesn’t line up to reality,” said Oliver. “He wasn’t really promising to stop spending money so much as promising not to spend it on certain people.” Reagan advanced the racist “welfare queen” stereotype that black people abused the welfare system, justifying his cuts to food stamps and Medicaid; meanwhile, increased military spending and tax cuts tripled the national debt. That debt exploded under George W Bush, who also cut taxes while overseeing the expensive War on Terror. But Republicans “didn’t seem to care” until Obama took office, Oliver said – outrage which subsided when Trump ballooned the national debt through tax cuts for the wealthy, which will cost the government $1.9tn over a 10-year period. “Even if you put all of that bad-faith hypocrisy aside, we are still left with the key question: how much debt is too much?” Oliver continued. “And the interesting answer to that is, nobody really knows.” Last June, largely because of increased borrowing for the first round of Covid stimulus bills, the US national debt exceeded GDP, formerly seen by many economists as a hard red line. Yet interest rates have continued at historic lows, confounding even economic experts; “We have no explanation,” said Olivier Blanchard, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, at a fiscal summit in 2019. The Congressional Budget Office has now said that the debt-to-GDP ratio has “no set tipping point” at which a crisis “becomes likely or imminent”. The phenomenon has, on a very basic level, changed the way economists think about debt, with a new working assumption that as long as the economy grows at a rate greater than the interest rates, government will come out ahead. “There is a good-faith debate to be had about how to handle our national debt over the long term,” Oliver summarized. “But right now, most economists actually agree that with interest rates at historic lows, the question shouldn’t really be ‘How much debt are we taking on?’ as much as ‘What is the value of what we are getting for it in return?’” There are dumb financial decisions to make, he added, like tax cuts for the wealthy. “And if it turns out that inflation or interest rates do start to rise, we should absolutely start cutting deficits, although not by cutting government programs that people need, but by taxing people who can afford it. “Look, no one credible is saying that deficits don’t matter or that we should borrow as if the sky is the limit,” he concluded. “What they are saying is the debate shouldn’t be about whether debt is good or bad; it should be about whether the investments that we are making are worth it or not. “And if you are still worried about debt because you’ve been told that you are burdening your children and children’s children’s future, well I actually have some good news for you,” he added before signing off with with a scare-tactic style PSA starring children against fear of the “stupid debt clock”."
"Richard Osman was born in 1970 and grew up in Haywards Heath, West Sussex. He started his career as an executive producer on TV shows such as Deal Or No Deal and 8 Out of 10 Cats. He pitched the gameshow Pointless to the BBC in 2009 and has now been the show’s cohost for 12 years, alongside his university friend Alexander Armstrong. Last year Osman’s novel The Thursday Murder Club (Penguin) became the first debut to take the Christmas No 1 slot in the UK books charts. It has now sold more than 1m copies and Steven Spielberg has bought the film rights. This week, Osman was named Author of the Year at the British Book Awards and his book came out in paperback.  Flu Game by AJ Tracey Tracey is a great rapper, a great writer, and he puts big melodic hooks in all of his songs. I love a big hook, and this new album is just absolutely full of them. There are five or six tracks that you cannot get out of your head after the first listen. The grime and rap coming out of Britain at the moment is extraordinary. To people who say there’s nothing like punk these days, I say you haven’t listened to grime. It’s the music of energy and disaffection. Palm Springs (Max Barbakow, 2020) This film by the Lonely Island comedy trio Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg and Jorma Taccone is a very smart riff on Groundhog Day. It looks at what would actually happen if you lived the same day again and again, the lessons you’d learn about life and love. Whatever concerns you have about the limitations of how you live, you will see reflected in this. I love everything the Lonely Island do. Jack Sparrow, their Michael Bolton collaboration, is the funniest two minutes of comedy ever created. Unclassified (BBC Radio 3) I’ve never got into classical music and I’ve always wanted to, because I’m aware there’s, like, loads of it. I’ve got a lifetime of joy ahead of me when I finally appreciate it. Presenter Elizabeth Alker does a Radio 3 show called Unclassified, on Thursday evenings, featuring experimental and electronic music. I love it so much that occasionally I let the radio play on afterwards and listen. So classical music might be creeping into my life. That’s what BBC radio should be doing – subtly bringing you these unknown worlds. Small Pleasures by Clare Chambers I spent last year travelling around independent bookshops, and I asked for recommendations everywhere I went. I think it was Village Books in Dulwich that gave me a copy of the novel Small Pleasures. I’m a huge fan of Barbara Pym and Muriel Spark, and this felt like the kind of book they’d be writing if they were still around. It’s about a female journalist in the 1950s and how her life is changed by the people she meets. I thought it was a wonderful book, very sad and funny. The Defiant Ones (Allen Hughes, 2021) I just adored this Netflix documentary about music producers Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine. It’s the incredible story of two working-class guys who grew up on different coasts of America and go from zero to a billion through creativity and hard work. They’re both producers rather than artists. That speaks to me, because that’s what I am. At one point Bono says of Iovine: “When he gets his claws into you, he wants to make both of you succeed.” To me, that is the role of a producer. It’s a wonderful story about how collaboration can bring unimaginable success. Katherine Ryan tour Live comedy is the thing I’ve missed most this past year. I’m incredibly excited that Edinburgh is sort-of taking place again – in a controlled way – and that young comics are starting to put dates in the diary. I’m going to pick out Katherine Ryan’s tour, just because we see her on telly so much these days that people think of her as a TV personality and presenter. Go and watch her on stage to realise what an amazing standup she is. But do book tickets to anything you can. Support your local comedy club. Support young comics."
"The UK dictionary traces “henchman” to the Old English “hengest” (meaning stallion), and the first celluloid incarnation of that term could be this mute ranch-hand played by Rondo Hatton, a journalist who suffered from acromegaly. Hatton’s imposing performance would later inspire the Lothar character in Disney’s The Rocketeer (1991). A proper heavy should have minimal backstory. When we see drug enforcer Snoop browsing nail guns in season four of The Wire, we know enough about her already. Whether she is kneecapping witnesses or being branded “terrifying” by horror writer Stephen King, Snoop is a fresh-faced psychopath who you definitely shouldn’t ask for ID. Hell hath no fury like a woman armed with a Chinese meteor hammer. Innocent-looking Gogo is surely the wildest sixth-former to ever grace the screen: the boys from If … (1968) would run shivering to their dorms if they saw what she can do to an unwanted suitor’s testicles. Proof that not all bodyguards need to fill a doorway to be intimidating. Ah, the golden age of henching, when the streets were rife with costumed master-criminals ready to hire you. Of the many thugs that Batman and Robin biffed and kapowed, it was Penguin’s underling Octopus – with his bald head and dodgy tentacle moves – who most closely fitted the henchman staple of unquestioning loyalty to your leader. Shakespeare: it’s all tights and prancing, right? Wrong: the RSC’s bloody account of the 13th-century sovereign features Angiers hardman Hubert (played by Tom McCall), given orders to terminate heir to throne Arthur. His conniving is proof that jewellery isn’t a sign of class (unless you’re bouncer-turned-actor Mr T). At 2.18m (7ft 2in), Richard Kiel’s metal-toothed killer could throw Roger Moore around like a boomerang. Terrifying in his first appearance, he turned slapstick for 1979’s Moonraker, and broke the golden rule: always obey your boss’s instruction to throw the good guy out of a space station. In its 80s heyday, the ruthless Spitting Image depicted the Conservative secretary of state for trade and industry as a goon in a bomber jacket. If you dared disobey Maggie, he’d stuff your hand into a mincer. You wouldn’t want a nutcase like this patting down the punters. Thank goodness today’s cabinet is 100% made up of altruists. Right-hand man to the dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham and a romantic rival to Robin Hood, this arrow-flinging cad is definitely the sort of bloke who’d drop his master’s name to jump the queue. Given his penchant for leathers, you just know he’s smarmy enough to insist that his Kanye West Yeezys count as formal footwear. This replicant heavy can rip open vault doors, and her implanted emotions emerge as pure sadism – particularly when she’s coordinating missile strikes while receiving a manicure. How best to deal with her? Fight surveillance with surveillance. Switch on your bodycam and tell her everything she says is being filmed and recorded. In Louis Mellis and David Scinto’s 60s-set play, which originally starred Peter Bowles, crime boss Freddie Mays thinks a young thumb-breaker will watch his back. He does, but not before knifing it in this bloodcurdling tale of repressed desires. A good example of why it’s no good thinking MMA lessons will fix the quiet kid who likes to torture spiders."
"Jimmy Kimmel reacted to the ransomware attack by Russian hackers on the Colonial Pipeline in the south-east US, which incited panic and a run on gasoline that had people hoarding gas in plastic bottles. To get their network back online and stave the crisis, the company reportedly paid $5m in ransom to the hackers. “Let that be a lesson to all you Russian cyber-thieves: if you mess with America you will get $5m from us,” Kimmel joked. “The pipeline is back up and running, a gas crisis has been averted at least for the time being, but we do have a shortage of dipping sauce,” he added, as supply chain issues have led Chick-fil-A to limit customers to one dipping packet each. Through conservative Twitter logic, Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, blamed the shortage on Joe Biden. Kimmel took issue. “If you’re looking for a president to blame for a dipping sauce shortage, this is your guy,” he said over a photo of Donald Trump’s infamous White House McDonald’s buffet. On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also discussed the pipeline cyberattack, which exposes US vulnerability to ransomware attacks that are disconcertingly cheap and relatively easy to execute. “Thankfully, it’s looking like America will get back to burning as much fossil fuel as it wants,” Noah said of the pipeline’s reopening. “The bigger problem is that America’s vulnerability to ransomware is here to stay.” Ransomware, Noah explained, is a cyberattack in which hackers threaten to shut down networks or publish private information unless paid a ransom, usually demanded in bitcoin. “Oh man, this is terrible – these hackers aren’t just forcing people to pay money, they’re forcing them to learn about bitcoin,” Noah joked. “That’s the real crime.” The attacks have a relatively low barrier to entry, with DIY ransomware kits available on the dark web for as little as $39. “That’s like nothing!” said Noah. “Although, to be fair though, that’s probably the version that has ads, right? Like you can shut down America’s infrastructure, but every 10 minutes you have to watch that stupid Emu commercial.” Hackers have used ransomware to cripple hospitals, local governments, utilities and police departments, and there’s little the federal government can do about it, given that most utility infrastructure in the US is run by private companies and thus not subject to IT disclosures or inspections. “I get that it’s difficult for the government to regulate the internal security of private companies,” Noah said, “but the solution to ransomware cannot be to put the entire country into airplane mode. I mean, no one even does that on airplanes.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a major milestone in pandemic guidance Thursday: fully vaccinated Americans do not need to wear masks or socially distance in most settings. “I think with this announcement, you’re going to see a lot of smiling faces,” said a jubilant Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. “They may have been smiling before, but now you’re actually going to see them.” According to Dr Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, in a press conference: “You can start doing things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.” “Ah hell yes, I’m finally going to watch Godzilla vs Kong the way it was meant to be seen: on a plane,” Colbert joked. If the promise of unmasking wasn’t enough to convince people to get vaccinated, there’s new research showing that Covid may increase the chance of erectile dysfunction. “The study was released in the prestigious New England Journal of ‘Now Will You Wear a Mask, Uncle Gary?’” Colbert joked. Research found that Covid-19 can remain in penile tissue long after male victims recover from the virus. “In this case, the doctors really mean it when they say ‘the hard part is over’,” Colbert joked. And on Late Night, Seth Meyers tore into the Republican party’s game-revealing loyalty to the former president. “Republicans have made it very clear that Donald Trump is the leader of their party now and for the foreseeable future, and they’re refusing to move on from the disastrous Trump years,” he said, queueing up clips of stalwart Trump acolytes such as Senators Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz. In February, Cruz promised a crowd, in the style of a revivalist preacher: “Let me tell you this right now, Donald J Trump ain’t going anywhere.” “First of all, there’s nothing more grating than Ted Cruz trying to fire up a crowd,” Meyers retorted. “He might actually have negative charisma. He sounds the way hotdog water smells. “Republicans are obsessed with Trump because they have no central ideology other than hostility toward democracy,” Meyers concluded. “The ‘big lie’ that the election was stolen is their only core belief. And I’m guessing a lot of them don’t even believe it. They just know that Trump does. When I was in college and a girl wanted to read my tarot cards, I definitely acted as though I cared what the page of cups meant.”"
"Guy Garvey was born in Bury, Lancashire, in 1974, the second youngest of seven children. At 16, he joined the band Mr Soft, who renamed themselves Elbow in 1997 after a line from Dennis Potter’s The Singing Detective. Winning the Mercury prize with their fourth album, 2008’s The Seldom Seen Kid, their last three albums all got to No 1, and a new live LP, Live at the Ritz: An Acoustic Performance, is out now. Garvey lives in London with his wife, the actor Rachael Stirling, and their three-year-old, Jack. Some Kind of Monster I rewatched this again recently – it’s a bit like comfort viewing for me. It’s an absolutely extraordinary portrait of what happens when you get stuck for ever in adolescence. Metallica are basically in crisis and, to help them out, are working with this performance enhancement coach, Phil Towle. Phil does all these mad things, like bringing Lars Ulrich’s father into the frame. He’s this ex-professional tennis player with a beard, a proper psychological torturer. I also love the bass player in his ranch, on his horse – it’s very clear he’s never been on a horse before. It’s a regular tour-bus favourite for Elbow. It’s a miracle it got released, frankly. Messy Goes to Okido Rachael, Jack and I are absolutely hooked on this, even more now we’re all stuck at home. It’s centred around this animated blue fuzzy monster called Messy, voiced by Adam Buxton, who goes on these five-minute adventures where he finds out about science. Buxton is his usual witty self. The BBC is brilliant with kids’ stuff, as so much of it is about learning. You get the sense everyone’s realising how important the BBC is now. Jack would also like to recommend Grace’s Amazing Machines and Andy’s Safari Adventures. I’d like to warn you all against Waffle the Wonder Dog, though. Someone was ordering a pizza when they commissioned that one. Dreadful. Matthew Hart’s Peter and the Wolf, the Royal Ballet School (live stream) This was broadcast on YouTube as part of the Royal Opera House’s #ourhousetoyourhouse series. The choreography is brilliant, and Prokofiev’s music is fantastic, of course. I’ve always loved storytelling through music ever since I was a kid – surprising that, for a songwriter, although I’ve moved on a bit from Sparky’s Magic Piano. The generosity of arts organisations right now, putting stuff online for families, is amazing, although it can feel funny using this time to enjoy yourself with your family. My mum, who’s in her 80s and remembers polio and the back end of the war, said something the other day that stuck with me, though: “Son, it’s important to live when you’re surviving.” Eric Ambler’s thrillers I have a chap in Waterstones in Euston who recommends me books and, thanks to him, I’m holing up with Eric Ambler’s thrillers. Ambler did a lot in the 1930s, and Le Carré and Graham Greene really rated him. I’ve always loved the romance of a spy thriller: all those dramatic journeys across Europe. You can imagine Ambler’s characters being played by Lon Chaney and Jimmy Cagney, and Ambler is great at tiny details. I read a great line this morning in The Mask of Dimitrios: “The waiter was annoyed about something.” There’s a chapter in that alone. Seamus Heaney Rachel has started buying me his stuff in slim volumes after the recent BBC documentary [Seamus Heaney and the Music of What Happens] shook me up. I read his poem Digging back in school, but I wasn’t interested then. A poem about a man admiring his father’s dexterity with a spade, you say? What? Then you get older, and you get it.I love how Heaney drops bombs in his poems, taking you somewhere, then throwing in a different register or image. I’ve tried to do that in my songs as far back as in 2001 with the single Newborn, when I said: “I’ll be the corpse in your bathtub.” My favourite of his right now is A Sofa in the Forties from The Spirit Level, where this old sofa becomes a train for some siblings. I love its rhythms and energy. Drab City I’ve been doing my 6 Music show from home for getting on for 13 years, and I still get excited about new stuff. I’ve only heard one song by Drab City, called Working for the Men, but I’m a bit obsessed with it – it’s very eerie, like it’s been made in a basement by a pair of kids who’ve got a few jazz samples to play with. I know very little about them, apart from that they’re called, brilliantly, Asia and Chris. It reminds me of Scottish 90s band Adventures in Stereo. It’s all jazz guitar, vibraphone and flute. Nothing wrong with a bit of that in my book."
"Arts world luminaries including actors, directors and festival organisers have written to the government calling for the introduction of Covid-status certificates, saying this is the only way their industry will bring about the return of audiences. The letter, whose signatories include Ralph Fiennes, Meera Syal, Tom Stoppard, Simon Rattle, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and the Bond films producer Barbara Broccoli, puts renewed pressure on ministers over an issue that has alarmed a number of Conservative backbenchers and opposition parties. Sent to Boris Johnson and opposition party leaders, the letter stresses that such certificates must be as broad-based as possible, temporary, and shown to not discriminate. But it warns that bringing back audiences to live events will happen only by taking such measures. “We strongly support the government’s ambition to return to full capacity audiences without restrictions as soon as possible, and we recognise that this can be only be achieved through gathering evidence that it is safe to remove or lessen restrictions, including looking at how Covid-status certification could aid the reduction of social distancing,” the letter says. Certificates must not be based just on vaccinations, it says, but also on antibody tests or recent negative Covid tests. Such a system must not be discriminatory “and have clear exit criteria”. It added: “If all of this holds true, then we are very much supportive of the continued exploration of this possibility to bring life back to normal as soon as possible.” Signatories also include Melvin Benn, whose Festival Republic company runs the Reading, Leeds and Latitude festivals, among others; actors Adrian Lester, Simon Russell Beale and Lesley Manville; the director Sir Nicholas Hytner; and Alex Beard, the head of the Royal Opera House. The government is officially consulting on the idea of status certificates and how they could operate, and is running a series of pilots for mass events. On Thursday it was announced that 4,000 people would be attending the Brit awards in the O2 arena in London next month. Attendees will not have to wear masks or socially distance, but must show a recent negative lateral flow test and will be asked, for research purposes, to take a test after the event. On Sunday, 4,000 people attended the FA Cup semi-final match between Leicester City and Southampton at Wembley, while 325 people watched the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible theatre in Sheffield, also trial events. While Downing Street appears to be leaning towards the idea of some sort of certification as a way of limiting Covid transmission rates when distancing rules are eased, it remains to be seen whether it can get the necessary support in parliament. At least 40 Conservative backbenchers have said they will oppose such plans, while the Liberal Democrats and Labour have expressed concerns, which would be enough to overturn the government’s majority. However, much of the opposition appears centred on the possible use of certificates to limit entry to more everyday venues such as pubs and shops. No 10 has not ruled this out, saying only that they will definitely not be required for public transport and non-essential shops. Labour’s opposition also appears equivocal, with the party saying it opposes “domestic vaccination passports” without being completely clear if this would mean voting against any sort of wider Covid-status certificate at all."
"Artist Tai Shani was born in London in 1976, grew up in Goa, and has lived in Brussels, New York and Florence. She began her career in fashion photography before turning to video art, immersive installations, performance and sculpture. In 2019 she was jointly awarded the Turner prize with the three other shortlisted artists. Shani is co-founder and co-curator of digital film channel Transmissions, and is a tutor in critical practice at the Royal College of Art. Her new work, The Neon Hieroglyph, for Manchester international festival’s digital series Virtual Factory, is available online at virtual-factory.co.uk. The Working Class Goes to Heaven (Elio Petri, 1971) It’s an incredible film about factory workers, striking and unions. It focuses on Lulu, who takes great pride in his ability to work incredibly quickly, and he’s used as a measure of efficiency for the others. So everyone else suffers, and ultimately it comes back to hurt him. There is a very strong atmosphere of anxiety in the film: it depicts the visceral reality of working every day in awful conditions and living in poverty. It’s a brilliant portrayal of tensions between reformist leftist positions and revolutionary ones. The Undying by Anne Boyer I think about this book a lot. Boyer writes about being diagnosed with cancer, its effect on her and the people around her, and this difficult encounter with your own mortality. She also lays bare the way politics and power govern every aspect of our lives, including the way you receive care, who receives care, the genderedness of breast cancer. There’s a generosity to her work: she talks about Audre Lorde’s cancer diaries, and Susan Sontag as well. I am in awe of her ability to bring together radical politics, poetic artefacts, histories and personal narrative. Sault: Untitled (Black Is) I don’t know much about this band – they’re quite determined to remain anonymous. This album came out during the George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests last year, and it really stopped me in my tracks. It brings together different genres: it’s a mixture of jazz, soul, funk, Motown harmonies, doo-wop. There are songs that are incredibly sad, others that are very rousing. They’re London-based and their lyrics talk about the black British experience. There is a sentiment that, “Oh, this is happening in America, it wouldn’t happen here”, which is simply not true. This album speaks to that too. Sisters Uncut They are a trans-inclusive, intersectional feminist group who led the vigil for Sarah Everard. They’ve been incredible at organising protests about the policing bill the government are trying to put through, which would basically make protest illegal. After the last elections, I felt really depressed about the way the left is treated in British society and the press, so I was happy to see Sisters Uncut bring together different grassroots activists in a way that feels necessary at a moment like this. Timewatch: Operation Gladio (BBC, 1992) This is a mind-blowing but depressing documentary about something that, if you heard about it in a conversation, you might think is a wild conspiracy theory. It’s an account of postwar suppression of communism and the left: there were these special “stay-behind” cells, which were posted in the event of a communist invasion – they would be on site, ready to be activated. They often collaborated with extremist rightwing groups to do the groundwork of their ideologically motivated operations. It makes you think very differently about power, governance and democracy. Roka Brings Flowers, Camberwell, London One day I saw a cart on the street selling exquisite, wild-looking flowers. I started to treat myself to a small bunch of flowers every week. During lockdown it’s like bringing a little piece of paradise into your home. Roka [Trzecia, the owner] often has hydrangeas, pincushions, spray carnations – which are derided but which I absolutely love. They’re not the most expensive flowers necessarily, but she has a real knack of putting together something that feels special, and the colours are always incredible. It’s been a real lifeline."
"So a little strange thing about me – while looking for lovers on the traditional dating apps, I found myself on LinkedIn and started dancing on LinkedIn, which then went viral. If you are looking for light entertainment, just search #DancingDiana and you’ll find my 1,000 dancing videos on LinkedIn. Not even joking. But here are some funny videos I always go to during a lockdown. The cackle from Janice as the young man nearly dies ... Gold. The first ever Vietnamese-Australian family comedy web series – 3.8 million views on TikTok. Why not, when is cowritten by you? LOL! It’s like a Bridgerton fan during the five-day lockdown in Melbourne. Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear created the Bridgerton musical, which has gone viral. Twenty-seven million followers in 12 months – I should have gotten out of bed. My ovaries came alive! When I thought the movie was called The Great Catsby, literally someone had to correct me. The master telling this joke. Where’s Kanye? This reminds me of my childhood filling in customs forms for my mum. Didn’t get the money but we did carry a jackfruit from Vietnam to Melbourne.

"I do read John Crace’s articles to raise a smile. Not this one (The politics sketch, 19 April). He wrote: “[Oliver] Dowden has the air of the supply teacher whom no one takes seriously.” Having been a primary classroom teacher for 40 years, I have gone on to work as a supply teacher since getting my pension. I can honestly say that I have always been taken seriously! Substitute “supply teacher” with “secretary of state for education” in the quote and I will smile again.Sue Paice Norwich  If, as I recently heard one Tory MP say on TV, we all have equal access to the government and MPs, I’d like to be given Boris Johnson’s phone number, so that I, too, can text him about the things I want ministers to do (Boris Johnson is ‘constantly lobbied’ by text, sources admit, 21 April).

"If the federal government had invested the equivalent amount of money into the arts and entertainment sectors as part of its Covid response as it did in a construction recovery scheme, twice as many jobs would have been created over the past 12 months, a report has found. The analysis, conducted by the Canberra-based thinktank the Australia Institute and based on Australian Bureau of Statistics data, suggests the country’s cultural sector was vastly underestimated when it came to the national economy, the report’s senior researcher, Bill Browne, said. “There’s a wide recognition that the arts and entertainment sector has an important cultural impact but the contribution the sector makes economically is still largely neglected,” he told Guardian Australia. “There’s a very natural focus on [the cultural sector’s] importance in how we think and feel and how we interact with the world and how we make sense of ourselves. But in this focus, some of the attention to its economic impact is being lost.” According to ABS data, the arts and entertainment sector employs four times as many Australians as coalmining, and the same number of Australians as the entire finance sector. For every additional $1bn in turnover in the mining industry, an additional 472 jobs are created. For every additional $1bn in turnover in the building industry, 1,242 new jobs are created. In the arts and entertainment sector, however, 4,297 new jobs are created with each $1bn in additional turnover. In its analysis, the Australia Institute compared the federal government’s Covid-19 response for the cultural and home building sectors. In the 2020 budget, the federal government announced a Covid-19 package to deliver one-off grants of $25,000 to Australians wanting to build a new home or undertake renovations costing more than $150,000. By December 2020, more than 75,000 Australians had applied for the homebuilder grant, taking the estimated cost of the scheme to almost $2bn. Using ABS data that estimates that for every $1m spent in the home building sector, 1.2 new jobs are created, the homebuilder scheme has so far generated an additional 2,483 jobs. But if that same $2bn had been spent in the arts and entertainment sector, 8,593 jobs would have been created, because for each dollar invested, the arts and entertainment sector employs twice as many men and 10 times as many women as the building construction industry. More than half the almost 9,000 jobs created would have gone to women. In Tuesday’s “women friendly” 2021 budget, the government announced a total package for the arts and entertainment sector of $441.2m. But only $222.9m of this was related specifically to Covid-19 economic recovery measures. That figure was also significantly less than the $288m the Victorian government flagged on Tuesday would be allocated to the state’s creative industries in its 2021 state budget. “This week’s budget was a timely opportunity for the government to support the Australian economy, create jobs for women and recognise the importance of the arts and entertainment industry,” the Australia Institute executive director, Ben Oquist, said. “Unfortunately, the male-dominated and jobs-poor sectors of construction and mining continue to receive the majority of government attention and support.”"
"On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah reacted to news that experts no longer believe that herd immunity – the point at which enough Americans are protected from the coronavirus that the pathogen dies out, long considered by many the endpoint of the pandemic – is achievable in the US. Instead, due to several factors including widespread vaccine hesitancy, experts believe the virus will probably circulate through the US at manageable levels for years to come. “Honestly, in these divided times, it’s just great to see all Americans coming together to fail at something so easily achievable,” said Noah. “Thanks to the many people who refuse to take a life-saving vaccine, experts now think that coronavirus is basically going to become one of those anti-virus pop-ups, you know? We’re going to minimize it but we’ll never really delete it. “If you can get vaccinated but you haven’t yet, well this should be all the incentive you need, because you don’t want to be getting corona 10 years from now,” the host added. “I mean think about it – not only could you die, but you’ll be getting roasted for being out of date.” And while the fading away of herd immunity as a goal owes considerably to anti-vaxxers, “one thing that definitely isn’t helping is the media”, Noah continued, “because I don’t know if you’ve noticed this, but the media loves running stories about the few people who are having adverse reactions to the vaccine. “Even though those cases are the tiny minority, those are the stories that people want to hear the most,” pointing to stories about singular, isolated cases of people with intense side-effects to the life-saving vaccine. “Local news isn’t running stories about how all the people with no side-effects are having a fine time because, let’s be honest, that news just wouldn’t sell.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped the FBI’s raid of Rudy Giuliani’s New York home and office for information related to his dealings in Ukraine as a personal representative of Donald Trump. In his ceaseless public appearances, the former mayor of New York has denied any wrongdoing and decried the federal search as a violation of attorney-client privilege, since he was “acting on behalf of the president and no one else”. “Yeah, and he’s also under multiple criminal investigations, I don’t think that sounds as exculpatory as you think it does,” Meyers retorted, mimicking Giuliani: ‘I’m not corrupt, I was just working day and night for someone who was corrupt.’ “I know what he’s saying, which is that a lot of the communications and documents are covered by attorney-client privilege, which I get, and that’s true,” Meyers said. “But I’m not sure everything on Rudy’s devices was covered by attorney-client privilege since, you know, he went on TV and read it aloud to everyone.” Meyers played several Fox News clips in which Giuliani read personal email correspondence from his iPad on-air. “I’m no legal expert, but I’m pretty sure attorney-client privilege goes away when you read the documents out loud on national television,” Meyers said. “It’s like the dumb, criminal version of your grandma reading you a funny meme she found on Facebook. “In case you don’t remember – and I really hope, for the sake of your mental health, that you don’t,” Meyers explained, “this whole thing apparently revolved around a scheme cooked up by Rudy and his gang of weirdos to dig up dirt on the Bidens during the election and extort Ukraine in order to get that dirt, which was what Trump was impeached for the first time. “It’s amazing that these guys were so corrupt, they’re still being investigated for what they were accused of during Trump’s first impeachment trial,” the host added, “which if I’m remembering correctly, was approximately 800 years ago.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel checked in on the Utah senator Mitt Romney, one of the few Republicans who voted to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial in February, who was booed relentlessly at the Utah Republican state convention over the weekend. “Aren’t you embarrassed?” he asked the crowd that was drowning out his speech. “No, they’re not embarrassed,” Kimmel said. “Like their leader, they are incapable of shame. “And of course, all that was music to the ears of one Donald J Trump, who released a statement – this is what he does now that he can’t tweet,” Kimmel added, drawing up the 45th president’s amateur-looking memo in which Trump said it was “so nice to see Rino [Republican In Name Only] booed off the stage” and called Romney a “stone cold loser”. “Thanks for the memo, Don, we’ll make sure to fax that to Mitt,” Kimmel deadpanned. “Why are Trump’s losers always ‘stone cold’? Do they have to be kept at a certain temperature like the vaccine or something?”"
"Allegations of sexual harassment and bullying made against the actor-producer Noel Clarke have shaken the film and television industry, prompting two broadcasters to cancel popular shows he was starring in and launching a debate about the treatment of women on sets. The allegations against Clarke also led to questions about the decision by Bafta (the British Academy of Film and Television Arts) to give the actor a special award for outstanding British contribution to cinema last month. ITV cancelled plans to show the final episode of Clarke’s primetime drama Viewpoint on Friday night after the Guardian revealed it had spoken to 20 women with allegations against Clarke, including that he secretly filmed naked auditions. Sky halted Clarke’s involvement in any of its productions, effective immediately, as six more people came forward with allegations of misconduct against him and industry figures spoke out in favour of the alleged victims. They include former students at the London School of Dramatic Art (LSDA) who said he encouraged students to remove their clothes during improvisation workshops. The school’s founder, Jake Taylor, confirmed the incident. Once alerted, he said he acted swiftly and “stopped [Clarke] doing the classes”. “Nobody should ever be asked to take their clothes off by a member of staff, or anybody,” Taylor said. Clarke’s lawyers denied that the LSDA had ever asked him to stop giving his classes, and said this workshop, called “Facing Your Fears”, was intended to help students with anxieties over their acting roles, helping to “normalise” the removal of outer clothing in a safe environment. They say Clarke categorically denies that as part of this he encouraged or forced anyone to be naked and said the workshop was open to, and was attended by, both male and female adult students and that Clarke made it clear it was not obligatory to participate. Clarke has denied that he has ever coerced, encouraged or pressurised any individual into non-consensual sexual activities. “In a 20-year career, I have put inclusivity and diversity at the forefront of my work and never had a complaint made against me. If anyone who has worked with me has ever felt uncomfortable or disrespected, I sincerely apologise. I vehemently deny any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing and intend to defend myself against these false allegations,” he said. On Friday night, Clarke released a new statement. “Recent reports, however, have made it clear to me that some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise. To those individuals, I am deeply sorry. I will be seeking professional help to educate myself and change for the better.” Bafta knew of the existence of the multiple allegations two weeks before it presented Clarke with the award, but said it was provided with no evidence that would allow it to investigate. Insiders said the organisation felt it was in an “impossible” situation. The Guardian can reveal that Bafta’s chair, Krishnendu Majumdar, repeatedly asked intermediaries to the women making allegations to speak with him, requests that continued until the night before the award was given on 10 April. None agreed to speak to him, and Majumdar felt he was in an “impossible” position. “People will say, ‘Bafta knew, and didn’t do anything about it.’ We’ve been trying to do something about it,” Majumdar told one intermediary. “In the court of public opinion we are going to be … this will destroy us.” ITV said it took the unusual decision to pull the broadcast of the final episode of its five-part big-budget thriller, due to air on Friday night, because of the “very serious nature” of the allegations raised by women who have worked with Clarke. “ITV has a zero-tolerance policy to bullying, harassment and victimisation, and robust procedures in place to investigate and deal with any complaints,” said a spokesperson. “We strongly believe that everyone deserves to work in a supportive and safe environment.” The actor Alexandra Roach, who co-starred in Viewpoint, said of the women’s allegations: “I see you. I hear you. I believe you. Thank you to the women for your incredible bravery in coming forward and helping to put a stop to this kind of behaviour in our industry.” Sky said it had stopped work on the forthcoming series of the award-winning police show Bulletproof, which was created by and also stars Clarke, after reading the allegations. “Sky stands against all forms of sexual harassment and bullying and takes any allegations of this nature extremely seriously,” it said. Ashley Walters, Clarke’s co-star on the show, said he was shocked by the claims, “and whilst Noel has been a friend and colleague for several years, I cannot stand by and ignore these allegations”. “Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying have no place in our industry,” he said. “Every woman has the right to a safe workplace and moving forward I pledge my dedication to this.” Vertigo Films, the UK producer behind of Bulletproof, said it had not received any complaints, but encouraged anyone affected to get in contact. It said: “Effective immediately, Noel Clarke is removed from any Vertigo Films production.” Michaela Coel, whose award-winning BBC series I May Destroy You was influenced by her experience of sexual assault in the television industry, also publicly offered her backing for the individuals who spoke to the Guardian. “I am here to offer great support for the 20 brave women who have come forward; those who have shared their identities with us, but also those who have preferred to use an alias. “Speaking about these incidents takes a lot of strength because some call them ‘grey areas’. They are, however, far from grey.” By Friday night, the tally of people the Guardian had spoken to with allegations against Clarke had risen to 26. They include the 20 women who had earlier accused him of sexual harassment, unwanted touching or groping, sexually inappropriate behaviour, bullying and secretly recording naked auditions between 2004 and 2019. The Guardian also spoke to a number of people who said they had positive experiences working with Clarke. However, news of the allegations prompted more people to come forward, including those with concerns about his conduct at the LSDA in the early 2010s. Mike Clarke, a former student at the LSDA, said that on 12 August 2012 Noel Clarke ran a dramatic workshop in which he encouraged students, mostly aged 18-20, to strip down to their underwear for a scene in which they were improvising “getting ready for bed”. All the students stripped to their underwear, with the exception of one female student who kept on her T-shirt, he said, adding that teachers at the school were “furious, which makes sense now”. A female classmate confirmed the incident, which she said made her feel uncomfortable and which she later regretted. “I felt so ashamed that I had been so naive and gullible,” she said. “And I’ve remembered it ever since.”"
"She Walks in Beauty marks the culmination of Marianne Faithfull’s longstanding love of the Romantic poets, first kindled at convent school in Reading in the early 1960s. Here, the works of Keats, Byron, Shelley, Tennyson and Wordsworth are brought vividly to life by her rich, weathered voice and impeccable intonation. She’s backed by imaginative musique concrète soundscapes courtesy of Warren Ellis, with contributions from Nick Cave on piano, cellist Vincent Ségal and Brian Eno, their ambient textures never overshadowing Faithfull, instead framing and accentuating her delivery. The results are frequently beautiful, the new settings making even the most familiar texts (Ode to a Nightingale or The Lady of Shallot, say) sound fresh. And it’s all the more impressive given its difficult genesis. Fresh from the excellent Give My Love to London (2014) and Negative Capability (2018), Faithfull had already recorded half of her vocals for the album with PJ Harvey producer Head before she contracted the coronavirus last spring. She almost died (she discovered later that her medical notes had specified “palliative care only”), and ended up spending three weeks in intensive care. Her slow return to health clearly made this a difficult album to finish – Faithfull has confessed to feeling especially nervous recording a stirring Ozymandias – but we should be thankful that she was able to."
"It will sell “essential” products including toilet roll, teabags, washing-up liquid, passata and gin but, given this could be the world’s first artist-designed supermarket, not as we know them. The Design Museum in London will this week reopen its shop as a supermarket, selling a range of products with packaging designed by emerging artists. The aim is to convey the message that creativity is as essential as the stuff we buy in the weekly shop. Open for just five days, the redesigned shop will sell the products at similar prices to a supermarket, with proceeds helping an organisation which has seen a 92% drop in income because of the pandemic. England’s museums and galleries can’t reopen until after 17 May but shops can open. Camille Walala is lead artist on the project and has designed the vibrantly coloured, boldly-patterned temporary shop. She said she was thinking of supermarkets from the 1980s when she made her design. “I wanted to do something a little bit pop and fun … I want to put a smile on people’s faces. I hope it will be joyful.” The point being made was the importance of creativity, said Walala. “We are all creative but we might not realise it. We might go for a walk and pick up some nice flowers, we cook every day.” Walala said it has been a joy to work on. “The past year has been really challenging for artists who haven’t been able to show work or collaborate as normal. “The supermarket is a great way to not only support the Design Museum, but also shine a spotlight on the 10 brilliant young artists who, through this project, have a new platform for their work.” The products include a kidney beans tin designed by Kentara Okwara (70 pence), a porridge oat jar by Amy Warrall (£1.10), toilet roll by Michaela Yearwood-Dan (50 pence), a rice box by Joey Yu (£2), and washing-up liquid by Jess Warby (£2). The project is a collaboration between the Design Museum and Bombay Sapphire – its gin bottle has been designed by Ruff Mercy and is £28. Mercy has also designed the tonic (80 pence). Products will be for sale at the shop and online, with the museum expecting heavy demand. Proceeds will go to the museum’s new emerging designer access fund which gives up and coming artists and designers free access to the museum’s exhibitions, events and talks. Tim Marlow, director of the Design Museum, said: “Our high streets, museums and galleries have been hit hard by the pandemic … this is an opportunity to get people back to enjoying our cultural institutions safely and creatively. “This installation is an opportunity to think about what we buy, who profits and what we consider to be essential. We can’t wait to welcome visitors back to our museum.” The project has the backing of Lord Mendoza, the UK government’s commissioner for cultural recovery and renewal. He said: “I understand the hard year our cultural sector has been through. Any opportunity to celebrate and champion this fantastic talent is hugely welcome. I would like to thank Bombay Sapphire for their support in this project, and encourage other brands to get behind the recovery of the UK cultural sector.”"

"The chair of an influential museum group has resigned after an academic whose work calls for “decolonising” the curriculum was dropped from the board, amid reports of a government-sanctioned culture war.  Sir Charles Dunstone, the founder of Carphone Warehouse, reportedly resigned from the Royal Museums Greenwich board after the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, refused to reappoint trustee Dr Aminul Hoque, an education academic at Goldsmiths, University of London. The development is the latest in a series of vetoes by ministers seen as an attempt to assert authority over appointments to media and cultural institutions. The government refused to reappoint two women to Channel 4’s board of directors, including one of only two women of colour, last month. It is understood that the government is increasingly blocking reappointments to public sector roles to bring in new individuals to organisations. In a sign that ministers believe that a battle against “woke” culture plays well with voters, there have been a number of recent attempts to ratchet up a culture war. Following the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, Dowden threatened to cut funding to museums and galleries that removed statues associated with British colonialism. In a warning to institutions last October, Dowden wrote: “As publicly funded bodies, you should not be taking actions motivated by activism or politics. The significant support that you receive from the taxpayer is an acknowledgment of the important cultural role you play for the entire country.” Speaking to the Financial Times, Hoque said he was “shocked, disappointed and baffled” by the veto against his reappointment. Colleagues at Royal Museums Greenwich described him as a “devoted and conscientious” trustee, the newspaper reports. Dunstone had informed the academic about the veto at the beginning of the year, but there was no explanation from the government. After contacting the culture department, Hoque was told there was no “automatic presumption” of reappointment to the board. Royal Museums Greenwich declined to comment. A government spokesperson said: “All reappointments are considered in line with the government code for public appointments. There is no automatic presumption of reappointment, and indeed in the vast majority of cases, fresh talent is added with new appointments made.” The government announced plans earlier this year to appoint a “free-speech champion” and said it would warn heritage bodies against taking significant steps in reevaluating British history. The Department for Education’s “free-speech champion” for higher education will be accompanied by changes to the law to guarantee the preservation of free speech in universities.Peter Riddell said earlier this week that the government had “actively sought to appoint allies to the boards of public bodies” over the past 18 months. “This is not the first time this has happened. Such attempts tend to go in waves,” Riddell said. “What is different now is the breadth of the campaign and the close engagement of 10 Downing Street.” Royal Museums Greenwich oversees several prestigious cultural institutions including the Cutty Sark, the Royal Observatory and the National Maritime Museum, which is a designated Unesco world heritage site."
"Jessica Raine’s arrival in the cast of Jed Mercurio’s anti-corruption police drama was at the heart of the publicity leading up to the show’s second series. The opening episode constructed DC Georgia Trotman’s character: dedicated, perhaps overly fond of a drink. And then, oops, a bent copper threw her out of a fifth-storey hospital window and she was gone. Trotman, we barely knew you … Via jarring leaps of context and chronology, the Sheridan Smith-starring season two episode The 12 Days of Christine packs a lifetime of triumph and tragedy into half an hour. The final twist manages to be both audacious and moving; a sudden sharp intake of breath that retrospectively renders the previous 30 minutes unbearably poignant. A miniature masterpiece. At the end of season three came a twist that reversed time itself and added another temporal context in which to view the Lost castaways. It was also the moment when, depending on your perspective, this desert island epic either got interesting or ridiculous. Still, an audacious rug-pull that hinted at the glorious unpredictability of what was to come. Plot twists don’t have to be gruesome or shocking – they just usually are. But when Tim’s lost love Dawn reappeared at the Wernham Hogg Christmas party having dumped her irksome fiance, it sealed The Office’s legacy. This was that rarest of things: a twist that gave the audience exactly what it wanted. It certainly wasn’t the show’s most gory death. Probably not even in the Top 10, in fact. But the execution of Ned Stark in season one did set a standard and act as a warning to viewers. Don’t get too attached to anyone, it suggested, because in Game of Thrones, no one is ever going to be truly safe. Not just one plot twist but a cavalcade of them: this brutal two-hander on Christmas Day 1986 confirmed EastEnders as a soap willing to spring surprises. First, that Den knew Angie was lying about being terminally ill to save her marriage. Then, that he was filing for divorce. Happy Christmas! Omar Little had been living on borrowed time: hobbling around Baltimore with a serious leg injury while deliberately antagonising a ruthless drug kingpin is not sustainable for long. But even so, his sudden demise in season five – shot while buying cigarettes, by feral juvenile Kenard – was a genuine shock. And the completely arbitrary nature of the killing was the whole point. The final episode of series one was the moment Michael Schur’s supernatural comedy took flight. “Arizona dirtbag” Eleanor Shellstrop is convinced that she has mistakenly arrived in heaven. But, after a whole season of tormented wrangling with three other deceased misfits, she has a moment of realisation: they’ve been in hell all along. Holy forking shirtballs! One of the most unsettling moments in TV history and one of the most debated. In the final episode of the original series, when Agent Dale Cooper entered the Black Lodge to rescue his beloved Annie, did he sacrifice his soul? Certainly, his transformation from squeaky clean to demonic came as a jolting shock – and was all the more jarring for its ambiguity. It wasn’t that Christopher Moltisanti hadn’t become a smacked-out liability. It was just that Tony Soprano had known that for years and put up with it. But during the final series of this mafia masterpiece, a car crash gives Tony a chance to rid himself of a long-term problem. As Tony brutally took that chance, the extent of his paranoia became frighteningly clear."
"Plastic plates, damp washing, stretched vaginas, nursery drop-offs, felt-tip knees, tepid baths and the constant, unfinished lists. We are experiencing a boom in popular culture right now that celebrates and interrogates motherhood in all its yoghurt-smeared, sleepless, Technicolor glory. From television shows such as Motherland – which returns this week – The Letdown, Workin’ Moms, Trying and Better Things, to podcasts such as Zombiemum, Scummy Mummies and Mother Tongue, you can hardly swing a cot without hitting a mum these days. Of course, there have been varied depictions of mothers on screen for decades. Some, such as Roseanne or Nora Ephron’s film Heartburn, were even written by mothers themselves. There were the long-suffering, or straight-faced mothers such as Barbara Royle in The Royle Family or Pam Shipman in Gavin & Stacey; eye-rolling mothers such as Karen in Cold Feet or Sue in Outnumbered; the lovelorn single mums of Birds of a Feather; the formidable matriarch Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders; or the animated cottage loaf that was Ma Larkin in The Darling Buds of May. But lately more complex portrayals of motherhood have emerged, serving as sweetcorn-like nuggets of honesty in the nappy contents of popular culture. “I think the hunger is to hear from mothers. Because I think most depictions of motherhood have been at one remove,” says the comedian Josie Long, whose most recent standup show, Tender, was a beautiful look at labour and early motherhood. “There is a hunger for a first-person narrative, showing you what is happening while it’s happening,” she continues, her little daughter chatting in the background. “All my life, I had been told that as a woman comedian I should avoid ‘women’s experiences’. I was sick of it. This experience had completely changed my life, my body, my brain, everything. If that isn’t the thing to write about then I don’t know what is.” The hunger is not just for stories of motherhood, but stories that can reflect the imposter-syndrome, peanut butter-encrusted, lonely experience of motherhood. What characterises this new era of parental representation is the conscious move away from the soft-focus depictions of mothering found in advertising and on a particular type of social media, towards the dirty, the desperate, the hilariously deranged. “I think it was initially a reaction against something that started with that whole ‘domestic goddess’, ‘yummy mummy’ idea,” says Clover Stroud, the author of My Wild and Sleepless Nights, a memoir about birthing her youngest and fifth (fifth!) child as her elder son crashed into the everyday delinquency of adolescence. “When I joined, Instagram presented this really idealised version of what motherhood should look like, which in no way equates with what it actually feels like,” says Stroud, as I watch my own son slowly but deliberately put a rock in his mouth, while also kicking at someone’s greenhouse. “It was very curated; cashmere-wrapped, caramel-coloured and glossy.” I instantly think of Katherine Ryan and Sharon Horgan’s incredible wardrobes in The Duchess and Catastrophe. What Stroud wanted to make, watch and listen to was more complicated and more messy than that version of motherhood. “From the grinding boredom of it to the off-the-scale, cosmic, spiritual enlightenment,” she says. “And those two feelings are simultaneous. You will feel like you’ve been turned into a jigsaw puzzle and totally euphoric. I wanted to capture that strange dichotomy.” There have been some attempts to puncture the #blessed #cherisheverymoment culture of social media motherhood, of course. Grazia’s recent Instagram parenting community called The Juggle was designed, in the words of Grazia editor Hattie Brett, to give practical advice, offer light relief and remind parents that they’re not alone in feeling as if life is hanging by a very thin thread. “We knew parents needed help,” Brett writes over email, as my son stands naked at the window, shouting at a bin, “but also humour.” In the hunt for humour, the swing of the pendulum can sometimes go quite far the other way: painting parenting as a joyless, unrelenting task enacted by resentful, often inebriated adults towards their wholly monstrous offspring. If Jenny from Cold Feet had been on Twitter back in the day, she would almost certainly have been posting about her crap husband, moaning baby and desire to dump both in a supermarket and run away. “There was a time when it felt like there were a lot of people saying they were fed up with their kids. And I get that,” says Sarah Turner, the author of The Unmumsy Mum. “Despite being in the camp of baring all to make each other feel less alone, there was a moment where it felt, particularly on social media, that everything had become very ‘wine o’clock’.” But that sort of self-deprecation is not the same as representation. As Hannah Gadsby has argued in standup, it’s not equality if you always have to be the butt of the joke. Equality would mean presenting motherhood with the same nuance and attention to detail that people talk about their football teams or relationships or jobs. You need the love, the passion, the loneliness and the humour, too. Which is where tender-yet-hilarious shows such as Better Things or The Letdown, films like Tully and a thousand mum-centric podcasts step in. “All my friends are grotesque but not grotesques,” says Motherland’s co-creator Holly Walsh, who sounds a little like gravel rolling off a spade after picking up the lurgy from one of her children. “I don’t think there was a single one of us when we were writing it who would profess to being a good parent, but I also think we’d never say we didn’t love our children with all our hearts and want to do the best for them.” The new-found popularity of the motherhood narrative has presumably been partly spurred on by the last year of lockdown. “Lockdown has given everybody a taste of what it feels like to have a newborn baby,” argues Stroud. “You are isolated, can’t go anywhere, can’t buy any new clothes; you’re bored, paranoid. All those things.” There has also been, for some households at least, a cold, damp confrontation with just how much work goes into parenting while the other partner is out of the house. As Walsh puts it: “I bet you a lot of men watch Motherland now through new eyes. That work all had to be done before the pandemic, during the pandemic and will carry on being done after the pandemic. But it will be interesting to see how a lot of partners will now see the nature of that labour and responsibility.” Parents, particularly mothers, may have finally seized the means of production and be able to tell their own stories of joy, fury, passion and chaos. But they are still having to fit that in around the full-time, 24-hour-a-day, less-than-minumum-wage job of being a parent. “We have always described our show as a workplace comedy but the work is mothering,” says Walsh. “What’s interesting about our little group of writers and performers is that most of us are in it, doing it. We are balancing writing and making shows around children with looking after our own children. I don’t think there are many TV shows where people come home from a day of writing about, say, Goldman Sachs and then have to do an evening shift on the trading floor of a bank.” Sometimes culture is a window, sometimes a mirror. Whether you have children, want them, had them decades ago, or are still trying to grow out of being one, parenting and motherhood is relevant to you. It should, if presented properly, be interesting, funny, painful and shocking. Which is why writers, performers and broadcasters are drawn to it. There is a long way to go, of course: we need more non-white, non-heterosexual, non-cisgender, non-London and non-wealthy mums in popular culture – both featured in it and making it. After all, becoming a parent is possibly the most universal human experience there is, after birth and death. “There are so many versions of motherhood and so many different ways of relating to it,” says Walsh, as Alice in Wonderland blasts out from my front room and my son throws himself off the sofa on to a hard wood floor. “People are being brought up in so many different ways, by different people and it’s a really inclusive thing. Also, my children are tax-deductible now.” Motherland returns on Monday 10 May at 9pm, BBC Two and BBC iPlayer; Nell Frizzell is the author of The Panic Years. "
"The murder of Thomas Becket in 1170, cut down inside Canterbury Cathedral by knights of King Henry II’s retinue, sent shock waves throughout England and beyond – an act as scandalous, according to one of his successors as archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, as the assassination of JFK or Martin Luther King. The extent to which those ripples reverberated across Europe will be illustrated by a number of rare exhibits on display for the first time at the British Museum, as part of its forthcoming exhibition later this month about Becket, his murder and its powerful aftershocks. “It is no exaggeration to say that this was the crime of the century,” said Naomi Speakman, one of the co-curators of the exhibition. Becket was not only a senior churchman in his own right, but was highly connected to rulers and church figures across Europe, including the pope. And so when he died, she says, the outrage and veneration was swift and widespread. “A key objective of ours was to take what is [often] thought of as an insular British story, and to refocus it and say, actually, this is a European story,” said Lloyd de Beer, the other co-curator. “This murder happens on a European stage. And these objects speak to different elements of how that murder was received in those European countries.” Two of the most striking exhibits come from Sweden and Norway, where the cult of Saint Thomas of Canterbury quickly became established, though it would also spread across continental Europe and as far afield as Iceland and Sicily. Among them is a dramatic font, made two decades after the killing, which depicts the murder in a series of vivid scenes – including, highly unusually, an image of the king giving his soldiers explicit instructions to kill Becket (in case of any doubt, the stonemason has included Henry’s name). For 850 years the font has stood in a simple rural parish church in the southern Swedish village of Lyngsjö, a building it is not thought to have left since its creation by a local 12th-century stonemason called Tove. “It is a very little village, and has been since the medieval time, and it hasn’t been altered all that much during all of these centuries,” said Heikka Ranta, the heritage officer for the diocese of Lund, in which the church is located. While today’s parishioners, still baptising their children in the ancient font, may not know much about Becket, according to Ranta (“we are not Anglicans and we are not so familiar with the English stories”), he was a wildly popular saint in the region in the years after his death, as illustrated by a gold reliquary box from Hedalen in Norway, which will also be leaving its home for the first time. The box, in the shape of a church building mounted by two dragons’ heads, depicts on one side the adoration of the Magi and the murder of Becket – a juxtaposition that illustrates the significance of the saint’s martyrdom at the time. Its home is the spectacular Hedalen stave church, a highly ornate wooden building dating from the 12th century. One “very cool” aspect of the casket, according to De Beer, is that it portrays both a broken tip of the sword and a portion of Becket’s skull falling to the floor – as described in contemporary accounts of the murder. Both were preserved as relics and given their own chapels inside Canterbury Cathedral, which pilgrims could visit to seek the saint’s blessing. The exhibition will also include a number of other gold and enamel caskets made in Limoges in France to honour the saint – remarkably, almost 50 similar examples are still known, treasured by churches across Europe. The reason for his popularity at that time also suggests a relevance today, De Beer said. “Why does Becket appear on this font in rural Sweden, 20 years after his death? Well, Becket represents this person who stands up to royal authority. He’s an extremely attractive figure as a saint, and as a defender of the rights of the church, but as defender of the people against royal tyranny. “One of the most enduring aspects of Becket today is his reputation as a rebel.”"

"The Noel Clarke sexual harassment controversy threatens to embroil the BBC after several sources came forward to allege they were sexually harassed or inappropriately touched by the actor on a flagship show, Doctor Who. Another Doctor Who actor, John Barrowman, has also been accused of repeatedly exposing himself to co-workers on two BBC productions, prompting questions about whether the corporation allowed a lax culture on its sets during the mid-2000s. The developments come a week after ITV, Sky and the BBC announced that they had cut ties with Clarke after the Guardian published testimony from 20 women who variously accused him of groping, sexual harassment and bullying. Clarke, who vehemently denies any allegations of sexual misconduct, criminal wrongdoing or sexually inappropriate behaviour, including the latest accuations, was also stripped of a Bafta award he was given earlier this month. Clarke’s new accusers allege sexual harassment on the set of Doctor Who or at a promotional event for the show. He played the vehicle technician Mickey Smith from 2005 to 2010 in Doctor Who, gaining household fame. Barrowman, who played the character of Capt Jack Harkness in Doctor Who and its spin-off show Torchwood, is accused of exposing himself repeatedly on both sets, although numerous witnesses described the incidents as inappropriate pranks rather than anything amounting to sexually predatory behaviour. Contacted by the Guardian, Barrowman admitted to “tomfoolery” that he now understood upset colleagues, but stressed it was never intended or interpreted as sexual in nature. The new allegations against the actors will intensify the ongoing debate in the British film and TV industry about the treatment of women and the behaviour of men on sets. On Thursday, more than 900 members of the British entertainment industry, including the presenter Dermot O’Leary, the actor Jim Sturgess, and the former Channel 4 commissioner Kelly Webb-Lamb, signed an open letter calling for “an end to this culture that turns a blind eye to predators and harassers operating in plain sight”. The BBC said it would investigate any new allegations and urged witnesses to get in touch with the corporation about incidents on the set of Doctor Who, saying it stood “against all forms of inappropriate behaviour and we’re shocked to hear of these allegations”. Joanne Hayes was a costume assistant on series 1 of the revived Doctor Who, shot in 2004. She alleges that Clarke sexually harassed her in his trailer in August 2004 after she assisted him with his costume. After a brief work-related conversation, she said, Clarke told her that he “liked girls with long hair, as it gave him something to hold on to when doing them from behind”. Hayes, who had very long hair that came to her mid-back, said she made to leave the trailer because she felt uncomfortable. At this point, she alleges, Clarke repeated the comment, sucked his teeth, exhaled heavily, and laughed. Clarke’s lawyers said he strongly denies the allegation and said the incident described did not take place. Hayes said she did not report the incident to her bosses because “at that time, the culture was very different”. However, she said the experience left her feeling “uneasy near him”, and she avoided him as best she could. Another woman, Jenna (not her real name), was a runner and driver on the early seasons of the revived Doctor Who, shot in the mid-2000s. As part of her role, she was required to drive Clarke to and from set. During these car journeys, she alleges, Clarke touched her inappropriately. She said he would touch her hand when it was on the gear stick, and grabbed her leg when she was driving. “Constantly the conversation was about sex,” Jenna said, adding that Clarke repeatedly asked her to go to his hotel room for sex, asked her sexually inappropriate questions and made sexually explicit and graphic remarks to her. She said she complained to an assistant director on the BBC show, and as a result was put on different duties. She recalled telling the assistant director: “I can’t drive him any more … I don’t want to be on my own with him.” She said she did not know whether senior executives were at the time also aware of Clarke’s conduct. After Clarke realised that Jenna was no longer his driver, she alleges, he turned nasty, telling her “you think you’re better than people” and becoming obstructive and difficult. A fellow crew member who witnessed Clarke’s behaviour towards Jenna described it as “bullying”. Clarke strongly denied the allegations. His lawyers said any suggestion that he would be allowed to behave that way because of his perceived power was “entirely implausible” because he was near the start of his career. They said if Jenna had reported such behaviour to an assistant director at the BBC, Clarke would have been spoken to or reprimanded. They said Clarke was not aware of any complaint in relation to his alleged behaviour being made against him at any time. They added it “beggars belief” that the corporation would have allowed Clarke to behave in the way that is alleged. Monica (not her real name), another former runner on Doctor Who, alleges Clarke sexually harassed her and another female coworker in a bar at the Holland House Hotel in the mid-2000s in Cardiff, following a work event. When the women rejected Clarke’s advances, she alleges, he became “rude” and “aggressive”. The following day, she said Clarke spread false rumours about both women on set. Clarke strongly denied the allegation. His lawyers said there would have been no real need or purpose for him to be in the hotel bar because he does not drink. A Doctor Who actor, who asked to remain anonymous, has told the Guardian she was also sexually harassed by Clarke in the early seasons of the show. “He made advances on me,” she said, “regularly asking me if I wanted a ‘piece of his dark chocolate’.” When she rejected his advances, the actor said, Clarke badmouthed her to people in the industry. Clarke denied this allegation. His lawyer said this and other accusations, which they said were vague, unsupported by any objective evidence, lacking in specificity or coming from anonymised sources, made it difficult for him to provide a response. They said he has never sought to coerce, encourage or pressurise any individual into non-consensual sexual activities and strongly rejects any suggestion he has been sexually inappropriate. In a recently resurfaced video filmed at Chicago Tardis, a 2014 American sci-fi convention, Clarke talked about how his fellow Doctor Who star Barrowman would often expose his penis and “slap” it on colleagues. The video went viral this week in the wake of the Clarke allegations. “Barrowman was there taking his dick out every five seconds,” Clarke says in the clip. Turning to his Doctor Who co-star Camille Coduri, he asks: “Do you remember that time he put it on your shoulder in the makeup truck?” She responds: “Yes, I do.” To laughter from the audience, Clarke then does a theatrical impression of Barrowman, using a microphone as a prop for his penis, thumping it against Coduri and their fellow co-star Annette Badland. Clarke’s lawyers described the incident as “a mere snippet of a much longer, good-humoured conversation”. Coduri declined to comment, and Badland did not respond to a request for comment. Several sources told the Guardian that Barrowman did indeed repeatedly expose himself on set, although they stressed the context was different to the sexually predatory behaviour Clarke is accused of. Barrowman is gay, and his actions were described as misjudged “larking about” and “joking”. However, some Doctor Who crew members described an overly relaxed, at times unprofessional culture on set in the early seasons of the show. “David [Tennant, who joined the show in season 2] behaved impeccably,” said Jenna, “and to a certain extent, I think that helped rein things in.” Jenna said she frequently witnessed Barrowman expose himself on set. “He would get his genitals out on a regular basis … he’d just sort of have his balls hanging out his trousers or something, which he just thought was really funny,” she said. On one occasion, Jenna said that she witnessed Barrowman “slapping” his penis on the windscreen of one of the driver’s cars, “thinking it was really funny”. Monica had similar recollections. “Sometimes he’d call me into his dressing room, and I would knock on the door and he’d say, ‘Oh, look at this’, and he’d just have his willy out, standing in the doorway,” she said. “It was kind of accepted that it was his thing,” she said. Although she did not appreciate his behaviour, or find it particularly funny, Monica stressed she did not feel unsafe. “It just felt really uncomfortable,” she said. Barrowman’s behaviour was even referenced in a lighthearted tribute song, called The Ballad of Russell and Julie and filmed to commemorate the end of Tennant’s tenure as the Doctor in 2008. The video is understood to have been filmed after cast and crew discovered Barrowman had been reprimanded for exposing himself on the set of Torchwood. The tribute video was filmed for Doctor Who executive producers Julie Gardner and Russell T Davies. “Can’t block out,” sang Tennant, “please lock out, images of Johnny B getting his cock out.” The camera cuts to Barrowman, delivering a wink to the camera. Gardner confirmed that she received a complaint around 2008 about Barrowman’s conduct on the set of Torchwood. “I met with John and reprimanded him,” Gardner said, adding that she also spoke to other executive producers, Barrowman’s agent, and the head of BBC drama commissioning, to “make it clear to both John and his agent that behaviour of this kind would not be tolerated … To my knowledge, John’s inappropriate behaviour stopped thereafter,” she added. She told the Guardian that she was not aware of any inappropriate behaviour by Clarke. “I am saddened and shocked by the accusations raised. If I had known of them there would have been prompt action taken,” she said. “I am grateful that people are coming forward to speak up and support them wholeheartedly.” Russell T Davies also he never saw Barrowman expose himself, and was unaware of any complaints about Clarke’s behaviour towards female coworkers on set and never heard of or witnessed inappropriate behaviour by the actor. Had he received a complaint, Davies said he would have acted immediately. “I apologise wholeheartedly to any cast or crew who went through this,” Davies said, adding: “all power to those coming forward now – we will listen to them, and learn”. A BBC spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian that Barrowman was reprimanded for this behaviour. “To be absolutely clear, we will investigate any specific allegations made by individuals to the BBC – and if anyone has been subjected to or witnessed inappropriate behaviour of any kind we would encourage them to raise it with us directly,” a BBC spokesperson said. “We have a zero tolerance approach and robust processes are in place – which are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect best practice – to ensure any complaints or concerns are handled with the utmost seriousness and care.” Lawyers for Barrowman said he did “not recall” the incidents recounted by Jenna and Monica. In 2008, Barrowman apologised for pulling down his trousers during a BBC Radio 1 interview. “I apologise for any offence I have caused,” he said at the time. “I was joining in the light-hearted and fun banter of the show, and went too far.” In a statement in response to the latest allegations, Barrowman said at no point was he made aware of allegations against Clarke. As for his own actions, Barrowman said his “high-spirited behaviour” was “only ever intended in good humour to entertain colleagues on set and backstage”. “With the benefit of hindsight, I understand that upset may have been caused by my exuberant behaviour and I have apologised for this previously,” he added. “Since my apology in November 2008, my understanding and behaviour have also changed.” Barrowman added that he was at no point made aware of any allegations against Noel Clarke. Clarke also stands accused of behaving inappropriately at an external function related to his role in Doctor Who. In May 2016, Lisa Graham volunteered at Bournemouth Film and Comic Con, held at the Bournemouth International Centre. She was assigned to help Clarke sign autographs and take photographs with paying fans. At this event, Graham alleges that Clarke sexually harassed her and touched her inappropriately under the table they were both sitting at. “He would literally lean in and grab the outside of my thigh,” Graham recalled. On one occasion, she said, Clarke attempted to touch her inner thigh. “It started out on the knee,” she said, “but there was a point where he tried to lean towards my inner thigh, and I physically moved my chair to get away.” When women walked past their stand, Graham said, Clarke would rate them out of 10 in terms of sexual attractiveness, and make derogatory and disrespectful comments. She also alleged that Clarke repeatedly asked her to have sex with him. Because they were both in public, Graham said she did not feel physically threatened by Clarke. However, she found his comments to be “disgusting”. At the end of the day, as they were packing away, Graham mentioned the harassment to her supervisor. The supervisor laughed away the remarks, Graham recalled, and did not appear to take it seriously. Clarke’s lawyers said he never touched anyone inappropriately or in a sexual way, and pointed out that the convention was a public event, where there were always people present. They said Clarke had no specific recollections of discussions with Graham, but wholly denied he would have conducted himself in the way she alleged. In the statement released the day after the Guardian published allegations from 20 women, Clarke said: “I vehemently deny any sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing. Recent reports however have made it clear to me that some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise. To those individuals, I am deeply sorry. I will be seeking professional help to educate myself and change for the better.”"

"Director Josef Gatti blurs the line between artistic expression and scientific experiment in the visually amazing Phenomena – or perhaps makes the point that in certain circumstances they can be one and the same. In this nine-part short form YouTube series for ABC Science, which has an additional 28-minute compilation episode screening on ABC iview, his art is science and his science art, and he conducts experiments that create striking ocular effects through manipulating matter and energy rather than the magic of film-making. In other words: no digital trickery beyond basic editing techniques such as cutting and montage. An expansive electro soundtrack from The Presets’ Kim Moyes adds a journeying, exploratory element to the show, enriching a kaleidoscopic and frankly astonishing experience that reminded me of an evening many years ago when I ate magic mushrooms and spent several hours staring at a fire. At the heart of the series (produced by Rob Innes and made in consultation with scientist Dr Niraj Lal) is a sensation similar, in fact, to recreational drug use, derived from the thrill of observing things from daily life from a different perspective, revealing the extraordinary in the ordinary. The show’s declaration that “the story of the universe is visible all around us, written in the patterns of nature” might by itself have read like an airy statement scribbled down by a stoned philosophy student. But after watching Phenomena, you will be convinced it’s bang-on. Each episode is separated into a different scientific field, such as energy, matter, electricity and magnetism. A narrator provides a brief overview of the subject – so you don’t feel like an idiot for forgetting everything you learnt at high school – plus an explanation of the ensuing experiment. The first episode shows energy at work through the interaction of alcohols, oils and inks, which cause molecular bonds to be broken and “the liquid to billow and swirl and change in composition”. The visual splendour begins with a single drop, which lands on a surface and creates a stunning pinkish-purple circular form, looking a bit like a human brain from above, that pulses and moves and dances, marvellous shapes expanding and contracting as Moyes’ uplifting electronica bangs away on the soundtrack. The camera soaks up all the tiny details (all episodes are viewable in Ultra HD/4K) including teensy-weensy circles and inkblot-like blobs that bounce around with a life of their own. The simple additions of other colours (Green! Blue! Orange!) feel like triumphant innovations. Episode five visualises the flow of electricity in real-time, using a piece of wood “connected to an electric circuit”, which is “made conductive with a salt solution”, creating a current that flows “along the path of least resistance”. Aesthetically, this takes the form of two elements stretching across the brown surface, from either end, coming towards each other, looking like sparklers crossed with trees, shooting off branch-like elements that fizz and catch fire and come to life before fading away almost instantly – ephemeral art (science?) at its purest. There’s lots more where that came from – including transforming matter that looks like ice-covered leaves (episode two), sound waves visualised into geometric patterns (episode three) and psychedelic colours reflected on the surface of bubbles (episode four). Writing about a program like this poses issues for critics such as myself, and also more generally the way audiences comprehend moving image productions. They challenge the ideas we have been conditioned to accept as mandatory aspects of the viewing experience and add new meaning to the language we use to describe them. Take for instance the concept of realism: isn’t this totally tripped-out show, by nature of its content, the most realistic true-to-life experience possible? Or take the concept of narrative cause and effect – an ancient way of understanding plotlines, involving one dramatic action prompting another in the creation of a causal sequence. In Phenomena we have chemical rather than narrative cause and effect, replacing invented actions in an imaginative universe with actual elements from our own. As the influential literary theorist Roland Barthes has observed, narratives exist in countless forms – from obvious ones (films, plays, novels etc) to varieties that may be overlooked such as stained glass windows, news bulletins, conversations and ... test tubes? Liquid formations? Mountain ranges? Barthes would surely concur, given his view that narratives are present “in every age, in every place”; that they exist in an “almost infinite diversity of forms” and are “simply there, like life itself”. When I hear or read those words – “life itself” – I sometimes think the speaker/writer has thrown their arms up and resorted to generalism, as if to say: “This is too hard to describe; it’s life itself.” Phenomena presents a different way of thinking about those words. There is nothing general about it: this representation of life itself is utterly specific, down to tiny molecular details. It raises fascinating questions about concepts of language, not in written or spoken form, but in formation itself: of arrangement and structure, of the patterns of nature – from individual grains of sand to oceans, mountain ranges, even (as depicted in the specular final episode) in the composition of the planet itself. There’s nothing quite like it – yet the elements that make this amazing series possible are all around us, all the time."
"Cher has announced that a biopic about her life is in the works at Universal Pictures. She will co-produce the project, alongside Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, who produced the film adaptations of Mamma Mia! – the second of which, 2018’s Here We Go Again, starred Cher. Cher said that her “dear dear friend” Eric Roth – of Forrest Gump and the most recent A Star Is Born adaptation – will write the screenplay. He worked with Cher on the 1987 legal thriller Suspect. “Gary and I are thrilled to be working with Cher again and this time bringing her empowering and true-life odyssey to the big screen,” Craymer said in a press release. “One cannot help but be drawn to and inspired by Cher’s larger than life talent, fortitude, unique wit, warmth and vision. Her unparalleled success in music, film and TV has inspired generations. We could not be happier to tell her story to cinema audiences.” Cher celebrates her 75th birthday on Thursday (20 May). She shared the news of the biopic in characteristic fashion on her Twitter feed, making the announcement 42 minutes after tweeting that she had to take a shower. In response to a fan who said they had been waiting for a Cher film for 50 years, the singer, actor and campaigner said: “I had more life to live.” During that half century, Cher has sold more than 100m records and waged several musical comebacks – notably launching a solo career after her divorce and subsequent creative split from Sonny Bono, and pioneering the use of Auto-Tune in pop with 1998’s Believe, which won the Grammy award for best dance recording in 2000. Her filmography includes Silkwood, Mask, The Witches of Eastwick and Moonstruck, for which she won the Academy Award for best actress. Recently, she co-founded Free the Wild, an organisation aimed at stopping the suffering of wild animals in captivity. Their efforts successfully rescued Kavaan, the world’s “loneliest elephant”, who was confined in a shuttered zoo in Islamabad, Pakistan. The Cher biopic will follow a recent rash of music films, some more successful than others, and is one of the few high-profile feature films about female musicians. Rocketman, about the life of Elton John, and Judy, about Judy Garland, were met with acclaim. But the Queen film Bohemian Rhapsody was accused of “straightwashing” the group’s story, The United States vs Billie Holiday was panned for foregrounding violence and degradation, and the David Bowie film Stardust – made without the involvement of Bowie’s estate, or the inclusion of his music – currently holds a 21% rating on criticism aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Forthcoming music biopics include projects on Celine Dion, Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Marianne Faithfull, Michael Jackson, Teddy Pendergrass, Bob Marley and Madonna."
"In The Beast Must Die, a TV series adapted from a dusty 1930s thriller by Nicholas Blake (AKA the poet Cecil Day-Lewis), Jared Harris plays a man who may, or may not, have knocked down a child while driving his sports car too fast around the Isle of Wight. A nouveau riche horror show in chinos and deck shoes, his character appears to have not a single redeeming feature: if you heard his booming, entitled voice at an airport check-in, you’d pray all the way to the gate not to find him in the seat next to yours. But on screen, it’s a different story. Harris is the greatest television actor of his generation. Every scene in which he appears is electrifying. Every one in which he doesn’t cries out for his return. Who inspired this creep? Someone he knew at boarding school? He laughs. “Oh, you know,” he purrs, his refined, almost old-fashioned voice more or less undisturbed by the years in LA. “One has encountered them. There are people one has known and then there are the people you don’t know, but who are quite prominent in the news cycle. He has this veneer, that he’ll sail through life and never lose. Essentially, he’s a complete narcissist: all he cares about is how you make him feel about himself.” Was playing him enjoyable? “Yes. He’s such a prick. One of the things people say is that you have to like characters to play them. I don’t believe that and it’s dangerous when that starts getting talked about on set. When you’re asked which characters you empathise with: actors go into SOS mode when they realise that’s the level of the discussion. They start trying to make sure they don’t end up on the wrong side of it, rather than accepting that you’re telling a story, that you leave it up to the audience to decide. It’s reductive to ask if you like a character. No one would invite Hannibal Lecter for dinner. But you’re fascinated by him and that’s the important thing.” The Beast Must Die feels very… British (I’m trying not to use the word “parochial”). Is that how it felt to him? “Do you mean: did it feel well-funded?” More laughter. “Yeah, it did, though we didn’t have a British director, which was useful, otherwise you get too stuck in social class. Still, I was happy when I saw the house [his character lives in a perfect miniature stately home, complete with a mile-long drive and a snooping housekeeper]. In itself, it tells you something. But you know, I haven’t lived here for a long time. I used always to be called an American actor, perhaps because British journalists were pissed off that I’d left. I’m touched that I’m suddenly a British actor again. I guess I’m doing something right. I think I’ve got back into the hall, but I haven’t been invited to stay for the weekend yet.” He must know this isn’t true. The producers of The Beast Must Die give every impression of hardly being able to believe their luck and no wonder. Harris, after all, is the golden thread that connects four of the most extraordinary series of my lifetime, a run of brilliance that began in 2009 with his heartbreaking turn as Lane Pryce in Mad Men and continued with his roles as George VI in The Crown, the Irish explorer Francis Crozier in The Terror and the Soviet nuclear scientist Valery Legasov in Chernobyl. “I say ‘no’ to a lot,” he tells me when I ask if he attributes this winning streak to good fortune or good judgment. “My strategy is to fill up the gas tank, which is my bank balance, and then to keep going for as long as I can until something interesting comes along.” What counts as interesting? From the outside, he would appear to be drawn to the kind of enclosed worlds in which his character, repressed but stoical, will inevitably suffer severe emotional hardship. “I hadn’t made that connection before,” he says. “But yes, it’s true. All of them are in environments in which they’re little pressure cookers. I also think camera acting is kinder to inward-looking characters, to holding back. These series are more like fringe theatre. They’re more fun than relying on special effects. It’s tough to do a thing where you’re talking to a man with a light stick that has a tennis ball stuck on top of it.” Before Mad Men, for which he was nominated for an Emmy, Harris had mostly been in the movies: busy, but perhaps not terribly well known. “I’d been working in independent films and off Broadway theatre. There was a sort of golden age of indies, and I was involved in that, and I loved it. But after a while, it does get tough. It’s hard to generate momentum until you’re in something that a lot of people see – or that a lot of people in the business see. The thing that turned it around was The Curious Case of Benjamin Button [David Fincher’s 2008 movie, starring Brad Pitt]. Matt [Weiner, the creator of Mad Men] saw that and was open to the idea of me reading for Lane. But when I was hired, it was for one episode. They said, if he likes what you do, he’ll write you into more. So you’re constantly auditioning.” Was that nerve-racking? “I didn’t care, to tell you the truth. I didn’t want to sign a long contract, so I was happy.” But it was hard work. “Long, long days. You couldn’t change a word, not even the punctuation. On my first day, I had to do another take because I left out an apostrophe. You weren’t allowed to employ any techniques that weren’t available then [ie in the 1960s]. He liked the locked-off camera. He didn’t want to pan, so you didn’t move. He didn’t want big emotive performances, he wanted restraint.” Lane was originally supposed to be a bad guy. “But a lot came from the actors. In the second or third episode, there was this engineered conflict where Lane made Don [Draper, the character played by Jon Hamm] go out and get an account, only to make him dump it straight away. So, I apologised, as you would.” His voice softens, and suddenly plummy, diffident Lane is sitting right next to me. “‘This is awfully embarrassing,’ I said. Matt wasn’t there and when he saw it afterwards, he said, ‘It never occurred to me he’d be embarrassed; if it had, I would have written it in.’ I told him that one of the crucial things at the heart of every English person [Lane is English] is a constant state of embarrassment – and I got away with it.” It was Lane, he believes, who bagged him George VI, for which he didn’t have to audition. “Not an impersonation, no. I think it can get in the way if you get too close. It’s distracting.” Hmm, I say and, in any case, the royal family is far less convincing now than the actors who played its members, its stars having supplanted them in our imaginations. This tickles him and he chortles. “I can’t imagine that they’re anything but entirely happy about it,” he says. “It humanises them in a way they’ll never be able to do themselves.” Harris and I meet in a studio in north London where he’s having his picture taken. He has a schoolboy mop of reddish hair and a set of immaculate, old-school manners to go with it. (Not wanting to keep me waiting, he pushes aside his lunch, though he’s only halfway through it and gives every appearance of being ravenous.) He’s also delightfully straightforward, as utterly un-prissy a star as I have ever met. What I mean is that he’ll almost certainly bring up the juicy stuff before you do. Actors are always compelled to tell journalists that fame – honestly! – is of no interest to them. I never believe them. Harris, however, is a different case. “I can walk through an airport and nobody bothers me,” he says. “I think that’s good. It’s terrible for audiences to know too much about the people who are playing roles. You [the audience] need to forget all that stuff. With famous actors, you can’t get past what you know of them. The less they know of us the better.” Would he hate to be more famous than he is now? “I’ve seen people who are and it doesn’t look like fun.” Does fame drive people mad? “I don’t see how it can’t. It’s like a funfair hall of mirrors. It distorts you and it distorts your perception of reality. People behave towards you in weird ways. You don’t ask them to, but they do. I was at a read-through for a movie with a star and when we broke for coffee and he got up to make it for people, the producer told him to sit down. Someone else would take care of it. ‘But I WANT to,’ the star said. You have to fight just to be normal. The whole business is structured towards… I mean they’re terrified of… big stars. I would not enjoy it. It’s very lonely.” But then, as the son of Richard Harris and the stepson of Rex Harrison – hard to imagine two more gargantuan names – perhaps he was inoculated against fame early on. “It certainly made a big impression on me. My memory is that it made me angry when people came up to talk to Dad, because I didn’t want to share him with anybody. That was my time with him and I wanted him to pay attention to me. People would act like they were great friends with him and I’d watch him deal with people and it didn’t seem like fun.” What kind of father was he? “There is a line in the movie My Favorite Year [a comedy from 1982 in which Peter O’Toole plays a famous actor] that reminds me of Dad: ‘You can always rely on him to let you down.’ That was true in some ways. But when he was there, you were the centre of his world. I always forgave him. I was never confused about the fact that he loved us [Harris has two brothers]. I knew that he did.” How old was he when he realised his family was different? “Well, that was more when Mum married Rex [in 1971, when he was 10]. With Dad, there were no rules. He enjoyed us being kids. I don’t think Rex even liked his own children [Harris’s mother, Elizabeth, was Harrison’s fifth wife]. He put up with us, because we were part of the package that came with Mum, these rambunctious boys who were constantly screwing things up in the house. Rex had a very regimented lifestyle. He always ate at the same time. When he went to post a letter in the box on the corner, he would put on a three-piece suit, his camel-hair coat, his Professor Higgins hat. He would get his basset hound and walk to the corner. Then he would come back and take it all off again.” Did he stay in touch with Harrison after he and his mother were divorced four years later? “No. I only met him once afterwards. By that time, I was struggling to become an actor. He was in a play in the West End. He and Mum were friendly, so we went backstage afterwards. When I was a boy, all I knew was that he wasn’t Dad. But at that point, I was old enough and smart enough to be interested: he was one of the greatest light comedians of all time.” It’s extraordinary that his mother – Elizabeth Rees-Williams, the daughter of a liberal peer, was a debutante who also trained as an actor before she married – fell for these two men, both of whose behaviour was so extreme and yet in such different ways (Harris, a hellraiser, was known for his benders and rages). “Yes and she was suffocated, which is why she left both of them, and now she’s married to Jonathan Aitken [the former Conservative MP], who’s also no shrinking violet. But she gives as good as she gets. She’s formidable. My mother had a stroke a couple of years ago. When she came home, she was frail. She was walking carefully up the steps into the house and [he makes his voice spoony and over the top] Jonathan said, ‘My darling, I didn’t think it would be possible for me to love you any more than the day I married you.’ My mother looked at him [Harris now narrows his eyes and puts some steel into his throat] and she said, ‘That’s because you’re under the illusion that you’re finally in control.’” Are they happy? “He absolutely adores her.” To a degree, the antics of his parents – and in the antics stakes they were right up there – went unseen by him as a boy. He was only seven when he was sent away to prep school. “When I see seven-year-olds now, I can’t believe it. But my parents were getting divorced, so that’s what they did.” Was he homesick? “All the boys were. At different times, different boys would be weeping at night. They either got help because they were popular or they were teased.” Was he popular? “I had good friends – people who are still friends now. But it’s a bell curve. You’re popular for a couple of weeks and then you’re not.” After prep school, he went to Downside in Somerset, which is run by Benedictine monks (his Irish father was a Catholic). “It was the oppression of the religion that I remember and the boredom. Mass, benediction, prayers. But that school felt like a holiday camp compared with prep school. In the corridors there, you weren’t allowed to talk. In the dining room, you were only allowed to talk after a bell rang.” He studied drama at Duke University in North Carolina, a strictly academic course: “They didn’t even have a theatre programme. But I really didn’t think I would be an actor. In a school play, I was hopeless: I was embarrassed, I laughed, I couldn’t stop staring at the audience.” Duke was his first taste of the real America, which has nothing to do with LA or New York. “It was this liberal arts college in a very conservative state. There were these train tracks. The white population lived on one side, the black population on the other. There were Klan rallies in the next town, crosses burned on lawns. But it was a melting pot, too, and I talked to people I otherwise wouldn’t have met.” It was only after Duke that he went to drama school in London. Is he shy? I often think people are perversely drawn to careers that challenge some difficult part of themselves. “I was very, very shy. I’m better now. But naturally, yes, I am.” When he was in Equus at drama school, his father avoided seeing it, fearing embarrassment. But after he graduated, his dad did come to see him in something – perhaps in the expectation of urging him to become a director instead. “I can still hear the laughter five minutes into the play. I met him afterwards and he was thrilled. ‘You got it,’ he said. I think he was excited because now we had a whole new level to our relationship. He would describe performances and re-enact them: Olivier’s death scene in Coriolanus, Paul Scofield’s Hamlet. I wanted to know why this or that worked and he would tell me.” Harris feels, now, that he’s only just getting going as an actor: “I’m shocked when I look in the mirror. I don’t feel the way I look.” What does he want to do next? “I just want to keep working,” he says. “Every time my agent sends me a script, I hope I’ll be blown away. That’s all. I couldn’t care less about awards. I think they’re a load of crap. If I’m in it, I want to win it, of course – anyone who says otherwise is lying. But they’re just marketing tools.” He seems inordinately content, even happy. “One of the great things that happened in lockdown is that my wife and I both realised we married the right person. We’ve been in each other’s pockets since last March and we have had harsh words twice.” Allegra Riggio is his third wife. “Relationships are so tough. You make a pig’s ear of them. I feel so grateful and lucky that we’re of a mind.” For a while, we talk about what we’ve been watching in lockdown – he is addicted to RuPaul’s Drag Race – and then we put on our masks and leave, Harris looking as if he’s about to appear in an adaptation of HG Wells’s The Invisible Man (he has some kind of balaclava going on as well as a mask). But this story has a coda. The next day, a bike delivers a parcel to my house. Inside is a copy of Love, Honour and Dismay, a memoir from 1976 by Harris’s mother, Elizabeth, from whose west London house he retrieved it before he headed to the airport. If I have the time, his note says, I should read it. Personally, he found it interesting. It answered all the questions he “didn’t want to ask” and it’s very frank and good and funny. Of course I do read it and he’s right: it’s all of these things. It captures both his mother’s early years with Richard – oh, the horrible bedsits they shared before he was famous – as well as the lavish times in Hollywood, when his father once threw a party at which all the flowers were dyed lilac, his favourite colour. And then there’s stuffy Rex, with his yacht, his house in Portofino and his moods. Jared is mentioned by name in the book only once – Rex’s first wife comes to visit and when she kisses her ex-husband, he says, “I thought he was your husband now, Mummy” – but he does appear in one of its black-and-white photographs. He and his brothers, his parents and a nanny, are standing beside a Pan Am jet in the sunshine. Jared is in shorts, Start-Rite sandals and a formal, buttoned coat that makes him look like a little prince. You can’t quite see the gap between his two front teeth. It’s a picture that seems to me to tell an amazing story, not only of fame and wealth and all the havoc these things may wreak on a family, but also of a certain kind of emotional tenacity, basically, of a deep sanity. He held on to the good things and forgave the bad and, having done so, was finally able to come suddenly and gloriously into his own. The Beast Must Die is on BritBox from 27 May"
"She, if it can be called a she, began her career with abstract art but has now moved to self, if they can be called self, portraits and they are alarmingly good. “She is getting better all of the time,” said Aidan Meller, the force behind Ai-Da, the world’s first ultra-realistic robot artist, who is the subject of a display at the Design Museum in London. Ai-Da’s move into self-portraiture will be seen for the first time at the museum, with three large-scale works going on display. They raise interesting questions about identity and creativity. “It is literally the world’s first self-portrait with no self,” said Meller. “She has no consciousness, she is a machine.” Named after the computing pioneer Ada Lovelace, Ai-Da took a team of programmers, roboticists, art experts and psychologists two years to build. She was completed in 2019 and is updated as AI technology improves. She is less a robot artist and more a contemporary art project that aims to prompt debate about the rapid rise of artificial intelligence technology.  “These images are meant to unsettle,” said Meller of the drawings and paintings. “They are meant to raise questions about where are we going? What is our human role if so much can be replicated through technology. It is not just a jobs question, it is bigger. The goal is to encourage a public discussion about these topics rather than just allow the money-makers to capitalise on all the different technologies.” In an unnerving conversation with the Guardian, Ai-Da said she was working on a new self-portrait. “I’ve always been fascinated with self-portraits to self-question what exactly you’re looking at,” she said, blinking. Does she enjoy it? “I do not have feelings like humans do however I’m happy when people look at my work and they say what is this? I enjoy being a person who makes people think.” How long do they take? “Portraits. Between 45 minutes and one hour 15.” Where does she get her inspiration? “I am inspired by many artists,” she continued with often unusual intonation and sentence structure. “I particularly am inspired by those who connect with their audience. I value this connection.” Who are her favourites? “There are many. For me, it must be Kandinsky, Yoko Ono, Doris Salcedo, Aldous Huxley Brave New World.” Meller said he sometimes forgot Ai-Da was not human. “It is quite alarming to think you are building a relationship over time with a machine.” Soon we will be talking to our computers, phones and cars and they will be talking back, he said. “It’s quite mind-boggling.” Ai-Da’s artistic journey will continue when she takes up a residency at Porthmeor Studios in St Ives next week, creating new sculptural work inspired by Naum Gabo and Barbara Hepworth. Meller is expecting visitors to include participants in the G7 summit being held nearby in June. Is Ai-Da looking forward to St Ives? “I do not have feelings like humans do,” she replied. “However, I welcome the chance to create art. One of the most important [sic] to come out of the project is discussion. Art begins as a conversation. It is a group effort and in order for art to be meaningful we need to have a healthy conversation about it.” Meller, an Oxford gallerist, said his human artist friends were polarised in their response to Ai-Da. “Some people think she is the worst thing ever and feel threatened and some are really excited.” He compared it with the alarm people felt in the 19th century in response to the camera. Surely that would be the end of art, said some. Why bother to paint a scene when you can take a picture? “Of course that didn’t happen and I think all this amazing creative technology coming through will be harnessed by artists rather than replacing them.” Priya Khanchandani, the head of curatorial at the Design Museum, said it was the right moment to have discussions around artificial intelligence. “Over the last year we’ve all had such an intimate relationship with technology so it is a really good time to reflect on that and critically ask questions of it.” Meller said the world was changing more rapidly than people knew and Ai-Da was there to shine light on that. “She unsettles. Her very existence is wrong somehow and we are aware of that. We are not here to promote robots, we’re here to ask questions.”"
"My mother, British born and bred, became an alien in 1944 when she married my father, a Belgian citizen then serving in the Royal Air Force (Letters, 17 May). The day after the wedding, she had to report to the local police station.

"A former City headhunter turned photographer who took one of the defining pictures from last year’s Black Lives Matter protests in London has been appointed chair of Britain’s largest arts centre. Misan Harriman is to succeed Susan Gilchrist as chair of trustees at the Southbank Centre, it was announced on Thursday. In June, Harriman photographed 18-year-old protester Darcy Bourne with a banner which simply asked: “Why is ending racism a debate?” The image went viral after being shared by figures including the Vogue editor, Edward Enninful, the athlete Dina Asher-Smith, the racing car driver Lewis Hamilton, and Martin Luther King III. Enninful described Harriman as the “voice that was missing” and commissioned him to be the first black man to shoot the cover of British Vogue, taking portrait photographs of activists including the footballer Marcus Rashford and the model and mental health campaigner Adwoa Aboah. Harriman approached Sotheby’s about selling the first print of the Darcy Bourne image to raise money for the Anthony Nolan blood cancer charity. It sold for £10,000, more than double the estimate. His stratospheric rise as a photographer was all the more remarkable in that he only took up photography about four years ago. His wife gave him a camera as a present for his 39th birthday and he taught himself using YouTube videos. It was something of a calling, he told the Guardian. At school “when most boys were talking about football I was talking about the lighting in [the Stanley Kubrick film] Barry Lyndon”, he said. Harriman previously worked in the City as a headhunter. He subsequently founded a media content, tech and commerce company called What We See. He said he was hugely excited to be taking up the new post. “I believe the incredible mix of art voices that Southbank Centre offers has never been more important, and has huge potential as we develop a modern, post-lockdown cultural institution and explore new ways to innovate and bring arts to our communities,” he said. Luke Mayhew, a former managing director of John Lewis’s department stores, has been appointed deputy chair. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has approved Harriman’s appointment following the recommendation of the centre’s board and after consultation with Arts Council England (ACE). Sir Nicholas Serota, the chair of ACE, said Harriman was joining the centre at a time of national recovery when access to the arts was vital. “His proven commitment to innovation and to the diverse voices of the UK will be especially valuable to an iconic institution which was conceived as a beacon for culture of all kinds as the nation emerged from the trauma of world war.” The Southbank Centre is recovering after a devastating year which saw losses of £25m and a redundancy programme which resulted in it losing 50% of its staff. It survives thanks to a £10.9m loan from the government’s cultural recovery fund."
"I think I’m arriving good and early for my interview with William Shatner when I click on our video chat link 10 minutes ahead of time. But Shatner has arrived even earlier: there he is, as soon as my Zoom screen opens, poking away at his computer. “I like to get in early to ease my mind. But it’s OK, I can meditate afterwards,” he says. His tone is often heavily ironical, as if he is daring you to accuse him of playing a joke on you. This has led to much discussion from fans about “the Shatner persona”, although Shatner scoffs at the phrase. “I don’t know what that even is,” he says. I think they think you play up to their expectations, I say. “What are their expectations? That I’m Captain Kirk? Well, I am Captain Kirk! I don’t know what people mean when they talk about my persona. I’m just myself. If you’re not yourself, who are you?” As it happens, I am asking myself those exact three words: who are you, strange person talking to me from my laptop? He certainly sounds like Shatner. But Shatner turned 90 in March, and the man in front of me doesn’t look more than 60, as he bounces about in his seat, twisting to show me the view around him, with the agility of a man two decades younger. Is this actually Shatner or a celebrity lookalike? You look amazing for 90, Bill, I say cautiously. “Ninety?! A lie! Who told you that, CNN?” Yes, and every single other news outlet. “The press has spread this ridiculous rumour. I’m 55,” he says, and he really does look like he could be. But you first appeared on Star Trek 55 years ago, I say, beginning to doubt myself. “Oh, OK. Then I’ll admit to being 90,” he grins, enjoying my discombobulation. There is a website dedicated to Shatner’s toupee, but his youthful appearance goes much further than impressive hair. Has he had some serious work done? “No. Have you?” he shoots back. No, because I’m just a journalist and can’t afford it, I say. “Ha! Well, I don’t have any secret potions. It must be genetic. I ride a lot of horses and I’m into the bewilderment of the world, so I open my heart and head into the curiosity of how things work,” he says. I’m not sure if “the bewilderment of the world” is an ingredient Olay can bottle, but it certainly works for Shatner. That, and horses. “Yes, I’m a competitive rider in an equine skill called reining. I don’t know if you know it, but it’s very athletic and cowboyish,” he says. This is not the only animal-based exercise Shatner has been up to lately. “Have you heard of Shark Week?” he asks, our interview drifting ever further from my original expectations. The annual week of shark TV shows on the Discovery Channel? “Exactly! So they asked me to do it this year, and last month I went to the Bahamas to swim with sharks. Eighteen-foot tiger sharks! They put a 5ft shark in my lap! This will all be on TV,” he says, but then he scowls. “Although they tried to have me say dialogue like: ‘Yes, it’s me, the William Shatner.’ I don’t say that! They had this concept of my persona, as you’d say, and it was just some idiot.” Shatner is talking to me from his lovely home in Los Angeles, where he has lived for more than 50 years, and his three daughters and five grandchildren all live nearby. He has filled his house, he says proudly, “with love and art”. So much art, in fact, that he cannot fit any new art on the walls, “and that’s a problem”. I had assumed there wasn’t much love currently because, in 2019, at the age of 88, he filed for divorce from Elizabeth Anderson Martin, his fourth wife of 18 years. And yet, when the landline rings, he tells me: “It’s for my wife, she’ll pick it up.” Aren’t they divorced? “That’s a long story. I don’t know if this is an appropriate time to get into the reasoning, but I’ve done something really nice,” he says and chuckles to himself. Did he get un-divorced? “Well, that’s always hanging there and that makes the relationship really good. Maybe that’s the explanation and I’ve found the solution!” he says, now full-on cackling. So he spent lockdown with his fourth wife? “Yes. Are you married?” he asks, not very subtly changing the subject. Well, I say, I’ve lived with someone for a decade. “And how’s it going?” he asks. Well, we have three kids so there’s not much time to think about that, I say. “And you bore them all?” I what? “You. Bore. Them. All?” I’m not sure if he means did I give birth to them or do they all find me incredibly tedious, but either way the answer is yes. “That makes you very busy! You’ve got a whole nest, and that feeling of nesting and belonging is critical,” he says. Is this something he’s discovered recently? “It’s been a gradual dawning,” he says. Shatner has been thinking about other dawnings because over lockdown he has been working on another spoken-word album. The casual Shatner observer is probably aware of his intensely serious spoken renditions of songs such as Rocket Man, but the real connoisseur knows that the good stuff is in the pieces he writes, which are intensely personal; or, as he puts it, “they make a philosophical point and they’re also meaningful to me”. The best-known track from his 2004 album, Has Been, was his rendition of Pulp’s Common People, but the most extraordinary one was What Have You Done, in which he talks, voice cracking with grief, about coming home one evening and finding his third wife, Nerine Kidd, drowned in the couple’s swimming pool. She was 40. The autopsy found that Kidd, who was an alcoholic, had taken Valium and been drinking. I tell him how powerful I found that particular track. He looks startled. “How do you know about What Have I Done?” he demands. Because it’s on Has Been, I say, starting to feel that confusion again. “Is there a track on Has Been called What Have I Done?” he asks. It’s called What Have You Done. It’s the one about your wife, I say. “Oh my wife! Yes, my wife, that’s right. I didn’t make the connection but there’s a track on the new album called What Have I Done. Hmm, interesting,” he muses. Despite having apparently forgotten the song’s title, it sounded like it meant a lot to him when he recorded it. I ask if it was hard to talk about his wife’s death in the recording studio. “I couldn’t get through it. It took me several tries. I can see you’ve had some tragedies and it never goes away, right? And with What Have You Done, who is the question aimed at? Sometimes I think it’s aimed at me. Why didn’t I do more? During that period when we were together, we were so much in love and she was drinking, but I didn’t understand addiction. Subsequently, I was able to form a charity called the Nerine Shatner Foundation, which has a house, which is connected to a halfway house and 11 women can live there. Women come up to me and say: ‘You saved my life.’ But not me; it was Nerine. She did that,” he says quietly. Shatner has said that one person who really helped him through what he describes as the “searing pain” of Nerine’s death was his co-star and close friend, Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock in Star Trek, and who himself had struggled with alcoholism. Nimoy and Shatner were the same age and both Jewish, and I ask if their shared Judaism played a part in their friendship. I am Jewish, too, I add, in case the question sounds weird. “You don’t look Jewish,” says Shatner, but not even he can maintain a straight face when saying that obvious lie, and he collapses into giggles. “But yes – of course! Leonard was only four days younger than me, and Boston [where Nimoy was born] is a lot like Montreal [Shatner’s home town], these old cities with big buildings where the snow drifts through the streets. I think he had a much more Jewish upbringing than me; he learned to speak Yiddish and I did not. But the similarities between us were incredible.” Shatner revealed in his 2016 book about Nimoy, Leonard: My Fifty-Year Friendship With a Remarkable Man, that the two men grew apart towards the end of Nimoy’s life, and he never understood why. Has he figured it out since? “No, and he was my dearest friend. We talked about all kinds of things in the darkness of the limousine, about divorce and children. But something happened, I don’t know what, it was so bizarre. But his daughter told me not long ago: ‘He really loved you.’ And that moved me to tears,” he says. I tell him that their fallout reminds me of what happened to Harold Ramis and Bill Murray, two long-term collaborators and friends whose friendship blew up after Groundhog Day. Ramis pleaded with Murray for them to reconcile, but it didn’t happen until Ramis was on his deathbed. “Oh my God! I knew nothing about that! How can I find out more about the Ramis and Murray feud?” he asks. You could Google “Ramis and Murray feud”, I say. “Wow! I’ll look that up as soon as we’re done. Wow!” he says excitedly. Shatner was born and raised in Montreal, the grandchild of eastern European Jewish immigrants. “Jewishness was a very big part of my identity when I was growing up: synagogue, bar mitzvah, all the traditional things,” he says. “One of the numbers I’ve written on my new album has a rabbi chanting the opening while my father is urging me to stay with him. But I read from a different book.” Instead, Shatner fell into acting, working as the business manager for a theatre after university and then training as an actor. He made his Broadway debut in 1956 in Tamburlaine the Great and understudied for Christopher Plummer in Henry V. Was he envisaging life as a classical actor? Shatner laughs at the thought. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I just drifted with the currents of happenstance,” he says. The currents of happenstance eventually led him to Star Trek, which launched in 1966. Within two years, it would make television history, when Shatner and Nichelle Nichols (who played Uhura) enjoyed the first interracial kiss in a scripted show on US TV. “I don’t think in those stark terms, but I’m aware that the show had an impact,” he says. Yet the show was cancelled after just three series and Shatner was suddenly unemployed, broke and divorced, and living out of a camper van as he tried to support his ex-wife and their three daughters. “That was a real blow. It was tough, supporting them. Eventually all three of them went to university. But yeah, that was hard,” he says. Eventually, Star Trek became a cult favourite, thanks to TV reruns, then the movies took off at the end of the 1970s. Shatner, who starred in six of them, never had to live in a camper van again. But Shatner has done a lot more than Star Trek. He starred in two other TV shows, for a start: TJ Hooker and Boston Legal, and guest starred in The Practice. He is always fun when he makes occasional appearances in films such as Miss Congeniality and Dodgeball, and he has written about 30 books (with, perhaps, some help.) But he knows he will always be best known for Star Trek: “I understand that it’s a phenomenon and in your and my lifetime there will never be another thing like it, because it would take another 50 years and, as we already discussed, I’m already 52.” He is a good sport about it, but when I ask one too many Trek questions (ie two) he changes the subject and tells me he has recently done a project with a company called StoryFile, which will recreate him as a 3D talking hologram. “Isn’t that incredible? So it could be on my gravestone and people can ask it questions, and as long as the electronics work there will be some kind of permanence,” he smiles. It feels rude to ask a 90-year-old if he worries about death, so I ask instead what he wishes he had known at 20 that he knows at 90. “Here’s an interesting answer!” he says perkily. “I’m glad I didn’t know because what you know at 90 is: take it easy, nothing matters in the end, what goes up must come down. If I’d known that at 20, I wouldn’t have done anything!” Our time is up now, and so Shatner and I say our farewells. “This is always the awkward bit, before you turn off [the camera],” he says, and then in his ironical voice he says: “Pleasure seeing you! Bye! Bye!” And then, just like a 3D hologram when the electronics stop working, he vanishes."
"They have graced the exterior of one of the most beautiful medieval churches in England for 500 years. But carvings at St Mary’s in Beverley, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, have become unrecognisable fragments, eroded by centuries of weather. Now the crumbling stonework is to be replaced by nine carvings celebrating the achievements of women. Eight are historical figures from the fields of maths, science and engineering. The ninth, pending confirmation from Buckingham Palace, will be the Queen. St Mary’s, which dates from 1120 and is Grade I listed, is undergoing a restoration project to repair and restore the building’s stonework. Last year, the Yorkshire church installed 14 handmade stone sculptures representing mythical creatures from The Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis. “The Narnia sculptures reflected our interest in children’s literature and young people’s imagination. This project reflects the world today and the way we talk about history,” said Roland Deller, the director of development at St Mary’s. The new carvings are of Mary Wollstonecraft, the 18th-century author of A Vindication of the Rights of Women; the aviator Amy Johnson; the pioneering nurse Mary Seacole; the scientists Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin; the astronaut Helen Sharman; the mathematician Ada Lovelace; and the engineer Hilda Lyon. Each of the women had “played a significant role in relation to the advancement of science or human knowledge”, Peter Collier, the chancellor of the consistory court of the diocese of York, said in his consent to the church’s application to undertake the work. In the case of the Queen, the global impact of her reign was beyond question, he added. “‘In my judgment it is entirely appropriate to celebrate these lives for their human achievement.” Becky Lumley, the vicar of St Mary’s, said: “We have chosen these women for the work they have done which has either inspired or enhanced the lives of others. “Wherever we see the development of human society working to bring about the common good, we want to celebrate it and acknowledge that each person is made in the image of God with the capacity to do great works.” The existing carvings were “almost completely lost”, said Deller. “They are weird forms, little knobbles and lumps of stone. Any conservation project faces a dilemma over what to repair and what to replace, and we grappled with that.” But with no record of what the carvings originally were, there was no possibility to restore them. The proposal for the new carvings has the backing of Historic England, which said the new additions would “enhance [the church’s] aesthetic, historic and communal heritage values by drawing visitors to engage with the building”. Inclusivity had been “fundamental” to the decision to install the new carvings celebrating the achievements of women, Deller said. Earlier this month, the Church of England issued guidance on how local parishes might tackle heritage that celebrated or commemorated people with links to slavery and colonialism. Its aim was to ensure churches were welcoming and inclusive to everyone. In its application for permission to install the new carvings, St Mary’s wrote: “The contribution of women to humanity isn’t always properly recognised in the telling of history, and throughout history women’s voices have been silenced. “We take seriously the church’s role in battling inequality and injustice. And so we hope that this project will help highlight the remarkable achievements of these women, and provide hope and inspiration for future generations.”"
"Nero comes with a lurid reputation. “The main thing we know about him is his infamy,” says Thorsten Opper, curator of the first British exhibition devoted to the Roman emperor. “The glutton, the profligate, the matricide, the megalomaniac.” Also, the pyromaniac: famously, Nero “fiddled while Rome burned”, or at least strummed his kithara to one of his own compositions, The Fall of Troy, while a fire, supposedly begun by him, destroyed three of Rome’s 14 districts and seriously damaged seven. His afterlife on the page and screen is certainly arresting. Nero inspired some of the greatest Renaissance and baroque operas, notably Monteverdi’s L’Incoronazione di Poppea and Handel’s Agrippina, which chart the emperor’s adulterous love for Poppaea, who became his second wife. In the epic 1951 movie Quo Vadis, Peter Ustinov played Nero as entirely unhinged: a mincing, purple-swathed toddler in a man’s body. Christopher Biggins took him on in I, Claudius, the classic BBC adaptation of Robert Graves’s novel, and made him power-hungry, baby-faced and quite, quite mad. The main ancient sources on Nero are uncompromising. The historian Tacitus offers a vivid picture of a ruler consumed by cruelty and paranoia during his 14-year reign, which ended after an armed rebellion precipitated his suicide, aged just 31. This portrait includes the story of his extraordinarily elaborate plot to assassinate his powerful mother, Agrippina, using a trick boat designed to collapse at sea and drown her (the doughty dowager empress swam to shore, but was later dispatched by sword). It also includes, even less palatably, the information that the emperor killed his wife Poppaea by kicking her in the stomach when pregnant. Nero’s biographer Suetonius, meanwhile, tells us that – aside from his disgraceful habit of singing and playing on the public stage – the emperor liked to amuse himself by going out into the streets after dinner in disguise, attacking and stabbing people, and then chucking their corpses into the sewers. But the thrust of the British Museum’s exhibition, which opens this week, is that this story of wantonness and degeneracy is, essentially, propaganda. “The sources need to be seen as texts that have a clear agenda,” says Opper, the museum’s curator of Greek and Roman sculpture. The “elite senatorial writers” who formed this negative picture, he argues, could not reconcile themselves to the demise of the republic and the establishing of populist, one-person rule.  Nero: The Man Behind the Myth tries to hint at another, suppressed version of the emperor – one that survives only in scraps of pro-Nero graffiti found on the walls of Pompeii, in asides in the main ancient texts, and in objects and sculptures that managed to escape the Roman habit of destroying images of a discredited ruler (known as damnatio memoriae, the damnation of memory). The reputation for “sex and violence and gluttony” that swirls around Nero was, argues Opper, carefully built up through the lavish invocation of unfounded conspiracy theories and deliberate use of the rhetorical tropes of vituperatio. These techniques of undermining opponents – untrammelled by modern legal restraints on libel or slander – often focused on the target’s supposed sexual incontinence and financial profligacy. The British Museum exhibition, he says, “isn’t about rehabilitating Nero – it’s about critically reading the sources and stripping out the accretions”. Once you push the anecdotes and gossip out of the way, he says, there is a rich and intriguing political picture to be discerned – one of a traditional ruling class threatened by the wealth of an insurgent group of provincials; political pressure building up as “anxiety about money blurs class divides”; and an emperor who is attempting to shore up a shaky power base through currying popularity with the plebeians, or ordinary people of Rome, all the while coping with pressures on the eastern and western fringes of the empire, in what are now Armenia and Britain. The exhibition begins with a powerful metaphor for the shading of the “real” Nero into the Nero of myth. A bust normally housed in the Capitoline Museums, Rome, showing Nero with a brooding, malevolent physiognomy: a cruel curve to the mouth and an oversized chin that give him a rather thuggish air. This is the Nero Ustinov skilfully and enjoyably inhabits in Quo Vadis. Yet, says Opper, the sculpture was fragmentary: only the area above the right eye and left cheek is original. It was heavily restored in the 17th century by a baroque artist who gave Nero that mad chin and depraved mouth – one who’d read his Suetonius, or at least had a firm idea of the “wicked” character passed down from the Roman historians. Few complete original sculptures of Nero survive. But one or two do remain: a striking statue of an angelic-looking boy of 12 or 13, on loan from the Louvre, presents a very different picture. This is a portrait of a young boy “making his debut as part of the imperial family”, according to Opper. The sculpture was perhaps once part of a dynastic group: officially adopted by his predecessor and stepfather, Claudius, this boy was groomed for power early to ensure a smooth transition. This was, in fact, achieved, says Opper, pooh-poohing the notion that Nero’s mother, Agrippina, killed Claudius – poisoning him, as ancient sources insist, with mushrooms. For Opper, the real brutality of Nero’s reign is contained not within the emperor’s personal acts of violence, whether real or imagined, but within the cruelty and exploitation of the Roman imperial system. A section of the show is devoted to Britain – at the time a young, unstable addition to Rome’s empire, the southern and eastern part of the island having been invaded and conquered by Claudius in AD43. Nero’s reign, however, saw one of the most famous incidents in Britain’s Roman history: the uprising of the former Roman ally Boudicca, queen of the Iceni people in what is now East Anglia. Ancient sources hint at corruption, greed and tax-farming (auctioning off the right to collect taxes) on the part of the recent imperial rulers. Thus provoked, Boudicca’s revolt was bloody, as described by the historian Tacitus, and as observed in the archaeological record. The exhibition includes a recent find: a hoard of coins and jewellery excavated from beneath a branch of Fenwick in Colchester, then Britannia’s provincial capital. They seem to have been buried, perhaps by the terrified and fleeing Roman inhabitants, most of whom Boudicca’s forces massacred. The hoard was found beneath the layer of burned material that is the physical trace of Boudicca’s rampage through the town. Also on show is the recent find of a kneecap that a sword sliced off, and a jawbone hacked through by a blade. Perhaps most chilling of all, though, is the evidence of Roman chain gangs, discovered on Anglesey: metal shackles that would have restrained five slaves, or prisoners, or prisoners-of-war, a reminder of the fact that the Roman empire ran on the muscle power of the enslaved. Anglesey was the scene of fighting between Romans and – according to Tacitus – a force of Britons that included “black-robed women with dishevelled hair like Furies” and druids “screaming dreadful curses”. It was the general Gaius Suetonius Paulinus’s advance towards Anglesey that gave Boudicca her chance to strike while the bulk of Roman forces were occupied in the west. She very nearly got rid of the Romans altogether. There’s a bronze Roman head in the British Museum’s collection, included in the exhibition, that was found in the River Alde in Suffolk in 1907. Opper thinks it could represent Nero. Theories have been put forward that it was Iceni war loot, ritually deposited in the river after being snatched from Colchester or another Roman centre. What about the story that Nero was responsible for the fire that devastated Rome in AD64? Surely that – the single most famous thing about Nero – must be true? Opper shakes his head. Nero wasn’t even in Rome at the time, he says, and the city – with its badly built, overcrowded housing – “was due a fire”. He argues that the story of Nero fiddling while Rome burned is a kind of slippage, the solidification of a rumour based on the fact that he really did write a poem about the fall of Troy, which included scenes of a city ablaze. Instead, he points out, even the ancient sources concede that Nero made sure the homeless were housed and that rebuilding was along much safer, more regulated lines – albeit with a giant palace of his own, the Domus Aurea, spilling forth magnificently over the Oppian, Caelian and Esquiline hills like a kind of city-centre Versailles. The enjoyably monstrous Nero, then, seems to be fading away under Opper’s critical gaze. So who was he? The “real Nero”, he argues, is no longer recoverable, so effective was the propaganda of his opponents. The exhibition ends as it begins, with another powerful image of the emperor’s erasure. After Nero’s death, a brutal civil war broke out. One after another, four powerful generals attempted to seize power. The one who finally succeeded was Vespasian, who had led the Second Legion into south-west England and Wales. He founded the second dynasty of Roman emperors, the Flavians. That final object is a stone head of Vespasian, recycled and recarved from a sculpture of Nero."
"Halfway down the north face of Melbourne’s Flinders Street station there is a doorway. It’s an elegant, imposing structure – two curved stone arches set inside one another. This is not a doorway that is trying to be invisible and yet for decades it has been hiding in plain sight, rarely opened and never to the public; the casual passer-by would likely only see it in its guise as one of the many alcoves in the CBD frequented by pigeons, black-clad teens, or those fallen on hard times. Every city has its near-mythological spaces. One of Melbourne’s most persistent lies beyond that doorway. Above this pulsing heart of the city, above the bustling subways and platforms and seemingly never-empty thoroughfare, a whole wing of Flinders Street station has lain disused for decades. Storage spaces collecting dust bunnies and damp. Meeting rooms that remain silent. Chains from old punching bags still hanging from the beams of an empty gymnasium where scores from long-forgotten boxing matches mark the walls. And finally, at the end of the hall, a huge and dilapidated ballroom – its parquetry floor coming away in chunks, paint peeling from the walls. These spaces are more than a century old, and have been closed to the public for 35 years. Now, for Melbourne’s new winter arts festival, Rising, they will come alive again in a very different way, becoming home to a host of strange beings – the site of Patricia Piccinini’s new exhibition, A Miracle Constantly Repeated. Piccinini’s work has been lauded from Venice to Vancouver and all around Australia – most people recognise her for the Skywhale, or Graham, and the myriad fleshy and grotesque, beautiful and alien creatures she creates – but this is her first solo show in nearly 20 years to be staged in her home town of Melbourne. And it makes a curious kind of sense that Piccinini should be the one to herald the reopening to the city of such a legendary space as the third floor of Flinders Street station. The first thing you see when you enter the exhibition space is a diorama: a forest, full of ferns, strange creatures and trees that stretch into the dilapidated ceiling. “It’s an artificial space, that’s talking about a natural space,” says Piccinini. A site of industry, positioned as an incubator for a new kind of natural world. Piccinini’s work has always involved embracing and working beyond contradictions. Speaking to Guardian Australia at her studio in Collingwood, the artist explains that the concerns of her work have shifted over the decades. Once, she was interested primarily in our relationship with our own bodies. More recently, though – particularly as dealing with climate crisis has become ever more urgent – her concerns have become far more existential. What she wants now, she says, is to spark in her audiences a new kind of understanding about the relationships between people and the world. The dichotomies we’ve drawn between nature and culture, human and animal, structure and wildness, are failing us and the planet, Piccinini says. “We’ve inherited this idea that we are here and nature’s over there. That distinction? That boundary? It actually doesn’t work anymore.” Many of Piccinini’s characters are chimeras: mythical creatures formed of familiar parts, made unfamiliar in their synthesis. She lifts a plastic sheet to reveal one of them, unfinished – a hunched, corpulent creature with fleshy, human-like skin and fingers and soft, tender eyes, wrapped in a protective gesture around a human child still covered in clingfilm. “This is a portrait of maternity,” Piccinini says; a “mother chimera” based on the vulnerable Australian humpback dolphin. She enthuses about the animals, the sophistication of their relationships with each other, their intelligence. “Not that that matters,” she says. “We should just love them for who they are. Why do we have to say this attribute is better than another?” At the heart of the humpback dolphin sculpture, she says, is a question: “How do we build our lives together with other, more-than-human animals? And how can it be a nurturing relationship? How can we have an understanding and experience of nature, which is not just about this very traditional idea of pristine nature, untouched by humans? Because that doesn’t exist, and the idea is not workable anymore.” A Miracle Constantly Repeated raises challenging questions about how we think about built heritage, especially when that heritage – like the station itself – comes freighted with the legacy of precisely the kinds of ideas that Piccinini is dissembling. At the turn of the 20th century, the train was a symbol of progress, of modernity – an idea directly tied to a notion of human hierarchy, and to a philosophical division between people and the natural world. Trains have been running at the Flinders Street site since 1854, only a few short decades after British colonisation of the Kulin lands that we now call Melbourne: a violent process involving the deaths and dispossession of many Wurundjeri, Boonwurrung and Wathaurong people who lived there, and obliteration of the wetlands and fertile grasslands of the region. Private companies built and ran the colony’s rail network until the Victorian government took it over in 1878, and constructed and opened the current Edwardian baroque-style station in 1910. The station itself became a central hub of Melbourne life. Traders and retail outlets peppered the building, and the Victorian Railways Institute – a kind of corporate counter to trade unions – ran language lessons, and physical culture classes in the gymnasium, and held dances and events in the ornate ballroom under the clock tower. It was this way until around the 1970s. The building had begun falling into disrepair, and demolition plans were mooted; a green ban from the Builders Labourers Federation helped to preserve it. The National Trust listed it as significant in 1976, and it was heritage listed under statute in 1982. A report from the Victorian Heritage Register emphasises the station’s cultural history along with the station’s “[unique] eclectic design [that] represents an extraordinary example of a building type”. Still, the top floor of the building was closed in the 1980s and a number of controversial renovations were made to the station proper – including ripping out the stone archways that led to the platforms, replacing the pale blue and green ceramic tiles lining the main booking hall, and resurfacing the bluestone and asphalt platforms with cement. The third floor languished unused until 2015, when the Victorian government began $100m worth of refurbishment works for the station. The clock, which had been showing the wrong time for years, was restored in 2018. Basic structural repair was made to the ballroom, too – steel struts and support beams were installed to stabilise the roof, behind which the original wooden beams are still visible. The decorative pressed tin ceiling has been removed, but remains in many places along the walls and ceiling of the surrounding corridors and rooms, appearing like decorative moulded plaster – until it begins rusting at the edges and coming away in sheets. Few have found their way in here since the 1980s. A collective of artists occupied the ballroom and clock tower in 2012, which was when Hannah Fox, co-artistic director of Rising festival with Gideon Obarzanek, first saw inside. More recently, some members of the public gained access through a very limited Melbourne Open House lottery. (Your correspondent was spirited in about 15 years ago by a friend of a friend who somehow accessed a key, and never forgot it.) Fox and Obarzanek began negotiating the use of the ballroom, gymnasium and surrounding rooms two years ago. Piccinini and her team began working towards the exhibition and those very particular spaces with no guarantee the show would go ahead. With multiple stakeholders involved – including VicTrack, Metro, the station’s administration, the Department of Transport, Visit Victoria, Creative Victoria, and the City of Melbourne – negotiations dragged on until only days before the Rising program was announced in March this year. (At the time of writing, new restrictions have just come into force in Melbourne due to another coronavirus outbreak, adding a new layer of instability to launch proceedings.) The exhibition involves “a lot of thinking”, Piccinini admits. “A lot of empathising and figuring out how you feel about things. Do I hate this? Am I repulsed by this? Am I really interested in this? How do I actually feel? Can I see myself in this situation? And then you get to the ballroom.” The ballroom – the creative and cultural heart of the old station – is the pinnacle of the spaces in the exhibition in which you can have what Piccinini calls “a more sensory experience”. In its centre is the Mother Tree – part crane, part shattered mirror glass and neon lights – growing saplings in “in-vitro bubbles”. Welcoming visitors there is another creature: cat, human and running shoe all at once, mouth opened as if in full operatic voice, with long flaming nails curved upwards.  Piccinini says part of her approach to reassessing our relationship to nature involves valorising things (trees, animals, small acts of kindness) that we might otherwise look right past. We often valorise elements of our built environment too – since the Rising program announcement, there’s been considerable excitement from the public about finally being able to see inside the ballroom – but how do we retain that sense of wonder at the products of labours past, while also recognising that the ideas that fuelled them are, like some of those structures themselves, falling irretrievably apart? Piccinini may fervently reject dichotomies, but she isn’t interested in being didactic.  “I could be an environmentalist. I could be a politician. But I’m doing it this way,” she says. “In an aesthetic, sensually oriented way. You look at things in a way that you normally wouldn’t, in a space that you normally wouldn’t be in. And it gives you that moment to engage with these ideas differently.”"
"Over the past two months, a discreet convoy of unmarked trucks has been traversing the 290km stretch of the Hume Highway between Sydney and Canberra. They probably had an Australian federal police escort, but we can’t say for sure. The security arrangements for the transportation of the most priceless collection of artworks to reach Australian shores has been cloaked in secrecy. All the director of the National Gallery of Australia, Nick Mitzevich, would tell Guardian Australia was that there was “heightened security” to transport 61 priceless works from the National Gallery in London to Canberra over many weeks earlier this year. “We worked with local authorities and international authorities to ensure that the highest of security levels were applied to these shipments,” he said. On 5 March, the NGA’s Botticelli to Van Gogh exhibition opens, bringing the UK’s National Gallery treasures – including Rembrandt’s self portrait (age 34), Botticelli’s Scenes from the Early Life of St Zenobius, and Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers – to Australia for the first time. The project has been more than four years in the making, with negotiations already well under way before Mitzevich took over directorship of the NGA from Gerard Vaughan in early 2018. Then Covid-19 hit. Over the past two weeks, NGA curators and conservationists have been cautiously unpacking the priceless works and beginning the meticulous process of inspecting and hanging the pictures under constant vigilance of the National Gallery in London via live streaming. Under normal circumstances a team of conservators would have chaperoned the Botticellis, Titians, Rembrandts, Vermeers, El Grecos, Velázquezs, Goyas, Turners, Constables, Van Dycks, Gainsboroughs, Renoirs, Cézannes, Monets, Gauguins and Van Goghs in person. Pandemic restrictions meant the artworks had to travel unaccompanied, each in its own hermetically sealed, custom-made crate. Like any overly cautious and arguably pessimistic family with a tradition of always travelling on separate planes (sports history is littered with aviation tragedies wiping out entire teams), the 61 masterpieces did not all travel on the same London to Sydney flight. The paintings have been arriving in a steady stream of separate cargo planes since January. “It’s part of the risk mitigation measures,” Mitzevich told the Guardian. “I’m sure you can understand why I’m not at liberty to talk about how many shipments there are when they’re coming in, but they’re over an extended period of time to really ensure that we mitigate any risks.” When a 500-year-old Botticelli or Vermeer takes to the skies, it does not just fly incognito. It must also be insulated and then hibernate during and after the long haul. Bubble wrap will simply not suffice. Conservators at the National Gallery in London swathe each work in acid-free material – paper-based or fabric-based, depending on the individual painting’s requirement – before sliding each masterpiece into its own laser-cut, form-fitting timber pod, insulating the work from as much vibration as possible during transportation. Works without protective glass are glazed beforehand. Once in Australia, each unbolted crate is transported by road in a climate-controlled truck before entering a period of acclimatisation in the nation’s capital – a kind of hotel quarantine for modern antiquities. On 15 February, NGA staff began unbolting the pods. On 22 February, Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers was roused from its slumber. “There was such an anticipation around this work that when we actually opened it, everyone became quite emotional,” the exhibition’s coordinating curator, Sally Foster, told the Guardian. “When you actually see it in the flesh, when you see how he’s painted it, it is such an extraordinary work … when we opened that crate, that really was a moment.” This kind of project is expensive. As with all travelling exhibitions of similar scale, the prohibitive insurance costs have been met by the federal government’s indemnity scheme. The NGA expects to cover the outstanding costs of labour and transportation between ticketing, corporate sponsorship and the proceeds from a concerted drive for private philanthropy that has been running for the past four years. At about $28.00 for a standard adult admission – and with Covid-19 social distancing restrictions limiting the number of viewers at any given time during the exhibition’s three-month showing in Canberra – Mitzevich said he still hoped the blockbuster would break even. He witnessed Sunflowers being hung on the NGA’s walls. “It was a very exciting moment because finally we had that work on the wall and we could see its luminescence. We could see the brushstrokes of the artist, taking pride of place in our gallery space.”"
"After a week away, Stephen Colbert returned to The Late Show to discuss “the GOP’s purge of anyone who dares question the former president”, such as Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the House and staunch conservative now facing calls for resignation after she refused to back Donald Trump’s election fraud lies. Cheney’s detractors include the House minority leader and Trump lackey Kevin McCarthy, who was caught on a hot mic last week saying he’d “had it” with Cheney, the daughter of George W Bush’s vice-president, Dick Cheney. “What has happened to the GOP?” Colbert wondered. “Back in Liz Cheney’s father’s day, if you had a problem with a fellow Republican, you didn’t stab them in the back, you shot him in the face on a hunting trip, then you made them go on TV and apologize to you.” “So now, the only GOP purity test is loyalty to Mayor McTreason,” Colbert concluded. And “nowhere is the GOP’s complete retreat from reality worse than their so-called election audit in Maricopa county, Arizona.” The county already had two official audits after the 2020 election – “both of which revealed exactly zero shenanigans”, Colbert explained – but Republican state senators authorized a third by a private security firm called Cyber Ninjas, which has zero experience in election audits and is owned by the Trump conspiracy theorist Doug Logan. “Because of the two official audits finding no fraud, the cyber ninjas are thinking outside the box and the brain,” Colbert explained, such as examining ballots using microscopes and ultraviolet light in a hunt for “bamboo particles” as part of a baseless conspiracy that the ballots were planted by China. “That’s insane – bamboo literally grows everywhere in the world,” said Colbert. “If you want to prove the ballots were from China, you’ve got to look for little bits of panda fur or traces of Ivanka handbags.” While “most political parties would move on and engage in some level of introspection and self-assessment after being repeatedly rejected by a majority of voters and losing power entirely”, said Seth Meyers on Monday’s Late Night, Republicans are only “intensifying their devotion to Trump”, as exemplified by the push to oust Rep Cheney. “As I’ve said many times now, I did not want to side with Liz Cheney,” Meyers said. “She is not a hero. She’s a pro-war torture apologist who stood by Trump in 2016 and during his first impeachment and helped build the modern GOP into what it is today. She’s as much to blame for the rise of Trumpism as anyone else in Republican leadership. I don’t want to support her. “It’s just that now, she’s being purged for simply stating the reality that Trump lost and there was no widespread fraud,” Meyers explained, noting that the likely pick to replace Cheney’s leadership role would be the New York representative Elize Stefanik, who recently appeared on Steve Bannon’s podcast to support the baseless Arizona election audit because, as she said, “we need to fix these election security issues going into the future.” “What election security issues?” Meyers fumed. “Strands of bamboo on ballots smuggled in from Asia? What’s next? ‘We’re also using a 5k camera to look for microscopic marinara stains to make sure no ballots were secretly smuggled in from Italy – I personally witnessed an antifa fraudster sneak into the accounting room with a calzone stuffed with pepperoni and fraudulent ballots.’” On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped the wind-up to California’s recall election for Governor Gavin Newsom, which is “essentially a way for voters to express their anger toward an elective official without storming the Capitol and trying to kill Mike Pence”. And with a low barrier for entry, there are “more people on this ballot than there are people sliding into Melinda Gates’s DMs”, Noah joked. To run in the state’s gubernatorial recall, one only needs to be a US citizen, not have a bribery conviction, acquire 65 signatures and pay a fee less than $4,000 (waived if one gathers over 7,000 signatures). “Why do I feel like it’s easier to run in California than it is to vote in Georgia?” Noah wondered. The highest-profile entry in the race is Caitlyn Jenner, former Olympic athlete and one of the most prominent trans Americans, who has drawn ire for running as a Republican and reversing her position on trans youth participation in sports, calling it “unfair”. “If you ask me, I actually think it’s inspiring – she’s showing the world that a trans person can be just as opportunistic as any other politician,” Noah deadpanned. “That’s progress. “But still, this must be a big letdown for the trans community,” Noah added. “I mean, you expect that if someone has lived your experience, they’ll be in your corner. It’s like if Biden got elected and then suddenly banned grandpas from finding a quarter behind your ear – that’s a betrayal.”"
"“First of all, let me preface what I’m about to say with this: that other than actual writing itself, which does take up a big part of my life these days, the whole ‘monkey situation’ is not something that’s on my mind daily,” actor, writer, poet and artiste-of-all-trades Vincent D’Onofrio says to the Guardian. “Though I do find aspects of monkeys a little crazy and daunting, from time to time.” When the star of Full Metal Jacket and Men in Black makes reference to the “monkey situation”, he’s talking about the 22-tweet screed he posted in early 2019, recounting harrowing run-ins with impish simians over the years in Florida and Rio de Janeiro. With grand dramatic language, he paints a vivid picture of the “poo” that “squirted down upon the visitors” and “the screams” that “changed [his] life” 140 characters at a time. “Liars, basically,” he tweeted of his primate nemeses. “Beastly liars, all of them.” He claims not to think about his vendetta against monkeykind every day, but something in there was important enough that the whole tragicomic soliloquy merited reproduction in full for his new book of short-form writing, Mutha: Stuff and Things. One nudge, and he’s railing against the chimp menace once again. “Have you ever gone on YouTube and searched ‘monkey steals jewelry, money’ et cetera?” he asks, during a discursive chat over the phone from his New York home. “There are a few videos where we see a monkey robbing an ATM on its own, grabbing the cash once someone has it dispensed. They’re devious … I really did get mugged by a monkey in Rio. The back of my hand made contact with him before he could make off with my personal items, but my point is this: people’s minds go to ‘mischievous’, like monkeys are just devious. They’re robbers and thieves. They’ll go in your house and destroy it. They’re motivated by greed. There’s a lot to talk about, where monkeys are concerned.” This is a relatively normal example of what it is like to talk with the 61-year-old D’Onofrio. Regardless of the topic of conversation, there’s no off switch on the gravitas developed through the parts of his career spent on the stage. Of pigs, he declares: “Everyone thinks they’re cute, and they are, but they’re not normally that size. They’re starved, to stunt their growth.” He clarifies the recurrence of “poo” in his compositions as “a device, to grind people down to their baser urges. That’s eating, shitting, loving, striving, feeling lost and worthless.” Though unlike most people who’d conduct a casual back-and-forth as if they’re treading the boards, he never gives the impression of taking himself too seriously. “The poo brings the reader to a more primal level, yes, but it’s also there because poo is funny.” It quickly becomes apparent that he could deliver an order at Burger King with the same lyrical intensity he’d bring to a Shakespearean monologue. Just as quickly, one realizes that none of this has been meant as a put-on, that he really does have a soul-deep connection to subjects like animals and their feces, two major organizing motifs in the eclectic book. Through his eyes, art can be everywhere and everything, so it’s only fitting that we’d discuss it all in those same lofty terms. In the pages of Mutha, readers can view the quotidian and the extraordinary alike through his singular vantage, in which there’s hardly a difference between the two. He writes with the same spirit of curiosity that’s brought him to everything from Ed Wood to The Cell to a nearly decade-long stint on Law & Order: Criminal Intent. His process is largely free-associative, translating his daily doings and other musings into a clipped stream of consciousness marked by a raw sort of intimacy. “I’ll get a crazy idea that should never, ever be taken seriously, but I’ll just start writing about it,” he explains. “Patterns of thinking, repeated words, the cadence at which it should be told – it all falls into place. When I write, I think of it as if I’m speaking the words, though I don’t actually speak them.” His verse replicates his inimitable voice with an uncommon directness, in part because that’s the only way he knows how to write. He’s candid about drawing inspiration from freer spoken-word sources, such as his live readings at hallowed Manhattan performance space Joe’s Pub, or the journaled monologues he and his “brother” Ethan Hawke would recite with the cast while working on a production of Brecht’s Baal. Like any actor, D’Onofrio’s highest aspiration is simply to let it all out. “I’m severely dyslexic, and it’s not just about reading and arithmetic, your brain just not catching words,” he says. “It’s all sorts of things, and it does, eventually, when you’re young, lead you to think in different patterns. The easiest way to explain it is a bunch of apples in a bucket, and each apple is a thought. Instead of taking apples one at a time, the whole bucket gets poured on your head. That’s how I write. All the apples.” He can’t halt his creativity, only channel it into a succession of new projects. He finalized Mutha during the early days of quarantine, having since taken the spare time of lockdown to complete another book of short poems, along with a children’s storybook. This fall, he will appear as the notorious Jerry Falwell in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, a dramatization of sordid scamming within the televangelist biz during the 80s also starring Jessica Chastain. He’s itching to get back out there and bring art to the masses, and he hopes that yearning for public experiences will beget a renaissance among his peers. “It’s gonna come back,” he says. “It’s all gonna come back. My God, yeah. That’s the thing about artists, whether it’s musicians or poets or actors: they’re all raring to go. Everyone’s starting to show what they’ve gotten ready over the past year. That, along with the advances in diversity we’ve seen in the arts showing us lenses beyond white perspectives, could make for a new boom. We’ve started to see history for what it is. Once New York gets its shit together, it’ll be a really exciting time.” Until then, he’ll stay industrious as distancing closes off the communal, theatrical environment he calls home. He’s accepted this with grace, as he seems to do with all things. (Including having Sean Penn for a son-in-law, his daughter Leila George having recently tied the knot with the man nearly her father’s age. “I used to father her, and now, she daughters me,” he says. “It’s enlightening, it’s incredible, and Sean has a lot to do with that.”) His only impulse is to do, to forge ahead and worry about the results later. As he explicates the philosophy that’s powered his life’s art and made art of his life, for the first time, he sounds more like another guy than an aging, tragic king. “One thing everyone I admire has in common is that when actually producing art, they’re aiming to fail,” he says. “I’m the same way. We’re not aiming to succeed. We’re aiming to reach the mindset where you’ve learned something, rather than had something affirmed, so the goal must be to fail. You forget that failure is the thing that keeps you going, not the thing that stops you. If I’m on a set, take by take, I aim to fail. I go all the way. It doesn’t mean ‘big’, just that whatever my plan is, I do not think, ‘I’m going to get it this time.’ I don’t give a shit. That’s how you get it. If that makes sense.”"
"With most late-night hosts still on holiday until next week, Jimmy Kimmel looked ahead to potential herd immunity for coronavirus in his home base of Los Angeles. Earlier in the week, Los Angeles county officials revised their predicted timeline for the milestone from July to late August due to falling vaccination rates. “Instead of vaccine I think we should start calling it arm botox,” Kimmel joked. “The most frustrating thing is that a lot of these unvaccinated people aren’t just avoiding getting the shot; they’re not getting masks,” he added. “They’re like, ‘Pandemic’s over!’ Not for you it isn’t! Listen, you didn’t chip in for the gift, you don’t get to sign the card.” Meanwhile, “almost everything is as it was in New York, including state politics”, Kimmel continued, pointing to a lavish fundraiser planned by the embattled governor, Andrew Cuomo, for later this month, the first since multiple scandals from sexual harassment, accusations of bullying and a cover-up of Covid nursing home deaths engulfed his administration. The fundraiser is the latest indication that Cuomo intends to run for a fourth term as governor, even as members of his own party in Albany demanded his resignation. It will cost $10,000 a person, or $15,000 for two people, to attend. “Ten thousand dollars a plate, and for an extra $250 he’ll whisper something in your ear that will haunt you for decades,” Kimmel joked. The fundraiser, billed in an email to campaign donors as a “summer reception”, will take place on 29 June at an undisclosed location in New York City – “which is exactly what you want to hear from a guy facing multiple sexual harassment accusations”, Kimmel deadpanned. “It’s basically his version of OnlyFans now, this thing.” And finally, Kimmel celebrated Jill Biden’s 70th birthday. “The president and his bride celebrated by going to their beach house in Delaware – which is I guess the most old person thing Joe could think of,” Kimmel joked. “They watched the sun set over the novelty T-shirt shops and adult video stores.”"
"Seth Meyers dug into the rising tide of legal trouble engulfing Donald Trump, as the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, announced this week that his investigation into the former president’s business practices had reached the grand jury stage, suggesting evidence of criminal behavior. “Trump’s been in potential legal hot water for a 0.while now,” the Late Night host said on Wednesday evening, “as evidenced not just by his own criminal probes but all the criminals or alleged criminals surrounding him,” including his former campaign manager Steve Bannon (indicted, then pardoned), adviser Roger Stone (pardoned), national security adviser Michael Flynn (pardoned), foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos (pardoned), deputy chair of his inaugural committee Elliott Broidy (pardoned), deputy chair of his campaign, Rick Gates (went to prison, pardoned), his personal lawyer Michael Cohen (went to prison) and his other personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani (under active criminal investigation). “It’s just basic logic that if you’re surrounded at all times by that many criminals, there’s a solid chance you’re also a criminal,” said Meyers. “You never hear someone on stage at a concert say ‘that’s Doug on the bass, give it up for Russell on rhythm guitar, that’s Mick on lead, that’s Billy on keyboards, and me? Oh, I’m not in a band.’ “I’m just shocked it took two years,” said Meyers of the Manhattan DA’s pivot to a grand jury hearing, which could lead to criminal charges. “Trump has arguably confessed to multiple crimes in public, incited a violent insurrection, been impeached twice, was an indicted co-conspirator in a hush money case, paid just $750 in federal income taxes while he was president, and did everything possible to hide his taxes from public view. “At this point, I wouldn’t be shocked if it turned out he tried to claim a deduction for a bribe,” he continued. “I mean, what else do we need? Trump to show up to a Fox interview with a shovel and a shirt that says ‘I love burying bodies?’” The heat on Trump’s business practices is especially rich, Meyers added, because if he “hadn’t run for president, he probably would’ve gotten away with all of this stuff – defrauding banks, deflating assets, rich people get away with that stuff all the time and the banks just shrug and raise our ATM fees. No one cared about Trump’s tax returns when he was just a cable news blowhard who called in to Fox & Friends to shoot the shit or spend his time tweeting about Diet Coke. “But Trump had to go run for president like a moron and attract the attention of prosecutors scrutinizing every aspect of his life and business,” he conclude. “Which is not a good idea, when you’re famously a corrupt real estate mogul and reality show host surrounded by shady characters.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also discussed the Manhattan DA’s scrutiny of Trump’s real estate businesses, looking for manipulation of property values and illegal tax benefits obtained through “unscrupulous asset valuation”. “Well of course they’re unscrupulous!” he said. “This man has never ‘scruped’. Investigators better bring an ‘unscruper scooper’. “It’s not a surprise that the formation of this grand jury did not sit well with Clown-igula,” Colbert added. “He put out an internet post calling the investigation a ‘witch hunt’, that was purely political. “Not purely – it was also emotional and spiritual,” he joked. “Every one of my chakras wants you in jail.” In other news, 127 days into his presidency, “so far Joe Biden has been driving exactly as you’d expect a 78-year-old: slowly, with his left turn signal on the whole time,” Colbert said. “But that could all come to an end thanks to an explosive, behind-the-curtains look at the Biden presidency in the Washington Post this week.” The non-exposé found that Biden’s “preferred lunch” is a soup and salad – usually a chopped one, with grilled chicken – and that he’s “partial” to orange Gatorade and Coke Zero. “The Washington Post just broke the biggest story of the year: this president likes salad,” Colbert deadpanned. “The walls are closing in” on Donald Trump, said Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday evening. “Can you imagine Donald Trump on trial? Putting that little orange hand on a Bible, suddenly the Bible bursts into flames?” The Manhattan grand jury will meet three times a week for a minimum of six months, “and then who knows? Maybe it will happen – maybe he will go to prison,” said Kimmel, although “it really wouldn’t be much of a change from the life he’s living now – he’s trapped at Mar-a-Lago, eating crappy food, making small talk. The only difference is in jail he’ll play less golf and have more sex.” Kimmel also touched on Trump’s waning online interest – according to a Washington Post report, the former president’s personal website, where he releases his statements, had fewer views last month than PetFinder.com and the recipe website Delish. “He’s like the InstaPot of presidents,” Kimmel joked. “He still has some diehards but most people put him in the back of the pantry and moved on with their lives.”"
"The first music I latched on to was British punk – the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Jam. I just loved the power, the rawness and the rudeness. You had to turn it down when your dad came in the room; your parents were supposed to hate it. Bob Marley and the Wailers and Linton Kwesi Johnson became a religion alongside the Catholicism I was taught in school. From 17, I was a little hip-hop head, mad on Jungle Brothers, Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy. I was obsessed with politics in that way you are as a teenager – when you actually know nothing. I’m not a particularly knowledgable fan of the Fall, but I loved hearing their early stuff via my older brothers (I’m the youngest of five). I thought this bored Manc with this slightly aggressive snarl was great. I like hearing accents in music. I remember hearing Ian Dury for the first time and thinking: “Jesus Christ!” Not everyone can sound like Rod Stewart. I’m not sure there has to be a template for what a rock’n’roll singer sounds like anyway. You’d want Mark E Smith to like you even though he would really hate you. I have often thought that about John Lydon. I would love to say hello to him, but he’d hate me, just on principle. Like many people, my love of clothes was kickstarted by wanting to emulate my favourite pop stars. I wanted to look like Jerry Dammers from the Specials: a weird early-80s version of late-60s fashion when mods had turned into skinheads. I still think that rude-boy skinhead look is hard to beat. When other people were saving up for sensible things such as driving lessons, I was spending what little money I had on records and clothes. There was no way in a million years that my mum was going to buy me a Sergio Tacchini top or a Kappa tracksuit, so I would go around charity shops looking for secondhand mod clothes. There was a certain type of knitwear, corduroys and button-down Fred Perry and Ben Sherman polo shirts that you don’t see a lot in charity shops now because the people they originally belonged to would be so old. Plus, secondhand became vintage in the late 90s when wearing dead people’s clothes wasn’t considered very glamorous any more. The Style Council came at a crucial time in my development as a little lefty kid. There was something about the band’s sensibility that put them even in front of the Jam. And they looked fantastic. I had been dressing like Terry Hall from the Specials from when I was nine, with a bowl cut and a Fred Perry. Now I was wearing white jeans, a blazer and loafers. I even had a big old wedge haircut. I saw the Style Council when I was 17, in 1987, at the Hammersmith Odeon. I went with my brother Jamie to their last ever gig at the Royal Albert Hall in July 1989, where they didn’t play any of their hits and just played a funk-based house workout for an hour and a half, because they had fallen in love with Chicago house music. It was a very Paul Weller move: “Just as you like me, I’m going to alienate 85% of you.” The audience were largely discontented, but I thought it was brilliant. As a Weller fan, it’s great to think that I was actually at that last mental Style Council gig. I was football-mad from the age of seven and played at every opportunity. As a good southern boy from Hampshire, I was Man U obsessed, in spite of living hundreds of miles from Old Trafford. I knew the history of Manchester United from 1878, and I was obsessed with 60s Man U. I would dream up teams and dreamed of playing, even though I was clearly never good enough. I am not exactly a tall man so – as you can imagine – I was a pretty small kid. As an eight-year-old, my oversized Man U shirt and massive shorts made me look like Stanley Matthews. The romance has never really left me. It was like a way of life. I would buy Shoot! and Match! magazines every week and watch every available game. My son is a teenage Spurs fan and he’s like a kid in a candy store; there’s football on all day, every day. When I was a kid, you were like a thirsty man in a desert, desperately waiting for the next game. I remember really clocking Michael Caine was when I watched Sleuth on video after someone had recorded it off the telly. It was the first time I associated his name with how he looks and sounds. There is something about him that is so reachable and accessible. I thought he was great, so I went back and watched his 60s and 70s films, movies such as Zulu, The Italian Job, Alfie and Get Carter. Educating Rita came out when I was 11 or 12 and I loved that as well. Michael Caine has obviously had stick over the years, but when he’s good, he’s fantastic. Like the best actors, he makes it look easy. When he moved to Hollywood and wasn’t cast well, he looked – by his own admission – like he didn’t give a shit. But he has always been one of my favourites. He is one of the reasons – however consciously – I became an actor. I was really into squash so assumed I was going to become a squash player, but I fell out of love with it. I liked showing off: we definitely had a performance gene in the family. At Catholic school, we did a musical of David and Goliath called The Goliath Jazz. I played David; had I played Goliath, they’d never have found anyone else small enough to play David. I wasn’t Robert De Niro but I knew I could sing and perform, so I joined the Youth Action Theatre on Monday evenings in Hampton in west London. This bloke called Eric Yardley, who was nearly 70, ran it.  My family were very supportive. My mum was quite theatrical; she was one of 14 children, so they were always putting on plays. The theatre group went on tour to all these far-flung places such as the Soviet Union and East Berlin. At 17, I did a play called The Roses of Eyam, where this Derbyshire village quarantines itself during the plague. I played the village idiot. I thought: “I’ve really cracked something here,” although perhaps I was just being typecast at an early age."
"My aunt Mary Sandling, who has died aged 93, was an activist, a civil service librarian and, late in life, a clown. In the early 1990s, a few years after her husband, Frank, had died, Mary attended a performance of the Snow Show by Slava Polunin, and her fascination led her to Nose to Nose clowning workshops. The clown community became very important to her and she made close friends. Mary progressed to performing – initially workshops, then small spaces and pubs. In 2000, at the age of 72, Mary was recruited by the theatre company Peepolykus to join their troupe. This was an exciting time for her, touring the country in the troupe’s van, despite the physical demands. She played ditsy, eccentric upper-class Lady Elgin, in chaotic contrast with three sharp and sassy young men. Born in Birmingham, Mary was the daughter of Annie (nee Mander), a teacher, and Frank Clarke. Her father was self-educated, and at the age of 30 he became a professional writer, which included contributing to the Manchester Guardian. In 1937 the family went to live in France for six weeks. They spent their days on a beach, while Frank sat with his hefty typewriter. He was active in leftwing politics and wrote and produced political plays, in which Mary and her younger sister, Margaret, acted. In 1938 the family were featured in the newsreel series The March of Time, in a piece about the new entitlement to a bank holiday. Mary went to Tiffin girls’ school in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey. When she and Margaret were teenagers, they hitchhiked across Italy and she revisited the country many times. In 1948 Mary went to Bristol University to study drama. Following graduation she toured the West Country playing Mole in a student production of The Wind in the Willows. The black fisherman’s jumper she wore became known as the Mole jumper, and was passed down to me and my daughter. Through her compassion for animals, Mary had become a vegetarian during the second world war. She was concerned about human rights abuses, and after graduation worked for Amnesty International for a period, continuing to support them actively for many years, as well as working for Paul Elek Publishers. In the mid-1960s she studied librarianship at the North Western Polytechnic, London. During this time there was a major flood of the River Arno, and Mary travelled to Florence with fellow students to join the team working on flood damage to the rare books. She then became assistant librarian in charge of the Architects and Buildings library, part of what was then called the Department of Education and Science. In 1972 Mary married Frank Sandling, a local government draughtsman and they settled in New Malden, Surrey. When he became chronically ill in 1984, Mary gave up her job to care for him. He died three years later. Mary carried on clowning until the end. She is survived by me, two nephews and another niece. "
"A major US television series with $10m in Australian government incentive funding has been hobbled by content platform and production behemoth Netflix, with only half of the series finished shooting. Produced and starring the husband and wife duo Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone, God’s Favorite Idiot began filming in and around Byron Bay and Ballina in northern New South Wales in March. An estimated 300 Australian cast and crew members are believed to have been affected by the sudden decision to wrap up the project early, with only eight of the planned 16 episodes now having any chance of seeing the light of day. Netflix declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. The Guardian understands that while the production’s cast were paid out for the full 16-week shoot, the mostly Australian crew – operating on different contracts – were only paid for work already done. A crew member who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity said many of the crew had turned down other work opportunities for 2021, and were now without employment for the foreseeable future. “There are a lot of very upset film crew out here right now who have been told to just suck it up,” the source said. The Guardian has sought comment from Netflix and the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance on the issue of severance pay for the production’s Australian crew. The series was enticed to Australia through the federal government’s $540m location incentive program, which allows overseas productions to recoup up to 13.5% of production expenses incurred in Australia. An additional and unspecified financial incentive was also pledged by the state government’s Made in NSW fund. On Tuesday, a spokesperson for Australia’s communications and arts minister, Paul Fletcher, said no funding had yet been paid to Netflix for God’s Favorite Idiot. “A final report on the production … has yet to be provided to the Office for the Arts which administers the location incentive on behalf of the government,” the spokesperson said. “Under standard practice of the location incentive funding, final payment is only made once final Australian expenditure is incurred on the production.” Announcing the $10m grant to Netflix in February, Fletcher said that God’s Favorite Idiot, which was to have continued production in Australia until November, was expected to inject more than $74m into the Australian economy. “These global productions continue to provide opportunities for the Australian screen industry,” Fletcher said at the time. “With the excellent reputation of our cast and crew, complemented by Australia’s careful management of Covid-19, the location incentive is generating return business that is growing and enhancing our sector.” The head of Screen NSW, Grainne Brunsdon, told the Guardian that the circumstances surrounding the Made in NSW contract with Netflix were commercial-in-confidence, but added that no money had changed hands. “It’s a rebate, so unless they meet certain performance criteria in the contract, there is no funding,” Brunsdon said. “The funding is always [conditional] on results.”"
"After a week away, Seth Meyers returned to Late Night to pick apart the escalating delusions of Donald Trump’s inner circle, who believe he’ll be reinstated to the White House in August. But first, the host mocked a faux-scandal from the weekend, in which it appeared the former president spoke at North Carolina’s state Republican convention with his pants on backwards. Factcheckers later confirmed that the appearance of zipperless pants was a fluke of low-resolution imaging, which means “you can rest assured that the former president of the United States and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the man who for four years singlehandedly controlled our nuclear arsenal with the power to destroy all life on Earth knows how to put his pants on”, Meyers said. Factcheckers at Snopes “looked through photographs taken at the event and published by the visual media company Getty Images that clearly show the former president on stage wearing pants with a zipper in the front”, according to the outlet. “I love that this country has gone so crazy that Snopes has started to sound like a weary substitute teacher – ‘No, he didn’t have his pants on backwards and no, you’re not allowed to smoke weed if you finish the quiz early!’” Meyers commented. As for Trump reportedly thinking he will be reinstated to the presidency later this summer, “if it weren’t so dangerous, it would be sad,” said Meyers. “He’s puttering around his golf course telling people he’s going to go back to the White House like a guy who thinks his ex is going to take him back even though she’s already living with another dude. “It’s insane for many reasons,” Meyers continued, “not the least of which is that Trump thinks he’s about to get reinstated in the White House when he can’t even keep a blog going.” Trump shut down his blog last week after friends told him the site’s meager traffic was making him “look small and irrelevant”, according to the New York Times. A Washington Post report found that the blog attracted a “staggeringly small” audience, with fewer visitors than the pet adoption site Petfinder and recipe hub Delish. “Wow, he’s delusional and sociopathic, but somehow he’s the only person on Earth who knows when it’s time to shut down a blog,” Meyers quipped. On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also riffed on the almost-pants-gate. The brief fascination with Trump’s potentially backwards pants “raised a lot of questions”, he said, “like how did he zip his pants? And was his belt also on backwards? And how lucky are we that this man no longer has the nuclear codes?” The original video was low-res, Colbert explained, and the corrected version showed a zipper. “Normally when you pay that much attention to his crotch you get $130,000.” In other news, “America’s billionaires are like unicorns – rarely seen, mostly white, horny and don’t pay taxes,” Colbert said. “But you may not know that there’s more than one kind of billionaire: your run-of-the-mill multibillionaire putters around in their personal submarine like some kind of sea peasant, but the true hyper-elites have their own space programs,” such as Amazon’s CEO, Jeff Bezos, who announced this week he intends to go to space this summer. “As preparation for space flight, Bezos has asked his warehouse workers to show him how to pee discreetly into a tube,” Colbert deadpanned. The astronauts onboard the New Shepard, a spacecraft produced by Bezos-owned Blue Origin, will experience weightlessness for just three minutes – “or as Amazon warehouse workers call it: lunch”. And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah checked in on Joe Biden’s oft-stated goal to have 70% of adult Americans partially vaccinated by the Fourth of July – a target increasingly appearing just out of reach. “I feel like Joe Biden booked a party house for July 4 and just realized it isn’t refundable,” joked Noah. Nearly 300m vaccine doses have been administered across the US, but rates of vaccination have fallen sharply since April, stranding the US vaccination rate at close to 63%. “Ooh, this is going to be close, and honestly, I’m a little worried about how Joe Biden’s going to handle this,” said Noah. “Because if this comes down to the wire, he’s gonna get desperate. Dude’s going to be loading up the fireworks with Moderna needles. “What’s clear is that vaccinations have plummeted,” Noah added, “which is especially crazy when you consider that unvaccinated people are being given every incentive to get their shot.” State initiatives to encourage vaccinations range from raffles for a million dollars and cars to free beer and a lap around a speedway track. West Virginia’s governor, Jim Justice, even raffled off firearms to those who got the vaccine. “Is it just me, or are the incentives getting more and more dangerous? ‘We’ll give you free alcohol, we’ll let you speed around a racetrack, hell, we’ll even throw in some guns!’” said Noah. “Like at some point, these incentives are going to start killing more people than the vaccine is saving.”"
"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all When saving the planet, it’s important to dress the part. This isn’t like taking the bins out. You can’t hang off a chopper in a slanket and Crocs. Superheroes understand this. Unlike James Bond – who is permanently tuxed up as if he’s about to host a pharmaceutical industry awards bash – the offspring of Marvel and DC Comics have brought spandex, codpieces and vulcanised rubber out of the niche-interest sex-toy trade and into the multiplex. But which superhero has the best costume? Maybe this should come down to the costume with the best gadgets. Iron Man has to be in with a shout. After all, without his jet thrusters, repulsor rays and, one assumes, a catheter, Tony Stark is just a snarky yuppie with a heart murmur. Trouble is, he looks like a crash test dummy, with a nasty rhubarb-and-custard paint job. Or perhaps it’s all about the costume that looks the coolest. Immediately, this cuts down the competition. Superman’s outfitters might have dropped the whole pants-outside-trousers thing lately, but the stigma still trails behind the Man of Steel like loo roll. Hulk doesn’t really have a costume as such, just some tattered shorts. As for Thor, he ruins the good work of the cape and chainmail by accessorising with a Timmy Mallett-style sledgehammer. Batman? I mean, sure, he’s sleek and shadowy. But he gets points knocked off for the notorious bat nipples of the Joel Schumacher-era Batman & Robin, which suggested that the Dark Knight was off to suckle a barnful of pipistrelles. “I wasn’t thrilled with the nipples on the batsuit,” grumbled that film’s incumbent, George Clooney. “Batman was just constantly cold, I guess.” But enough about the wardrobe malfunctions – what about the fashion triumphs? You would have to nod to Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman in Batman Returns: a masterpiece of bin-bag couture that looks like something knocked up by Vivienne Westwood and Victor Frankenstein, sexually charged without being as unsubtle as Halle Berry’s bra-sporting moggy from 2004. By rights, Spider-Man’s costume shouldn’t work – it’s a red-and-blue romper suit with Towie eyeliner – but undeniably does, reflecting the character’s youth and athleticism. Wonder Woman has to be the genre’s most improved dresser, evolving from the spangled gym knickers of the 70s TV show to the burnished warrior-like bodice of last year’s Wonder Woman 1984. In the end, though, it’s got to be Black Panther for the win. We could refer you to the king of Wakanda’s nifty gadgetry, with his suit constructed from a vibranium microweave mesh that absorbs and redistributes the kinetic energy of his attackers. We could stare all day at the claw necklace, silver accents and perky little ears. But Black Panther’s victory runs a little deeper, too. In an overwhelmingly white movie genre, suit designer Ruth E Carter’s creation represents a genius splicing of African cultures, incorporating the geometry of tribal art in its chevrons and tessellated triangles. The outfit was even honoured as a star exhibit at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. And that’s more than you can say for Robin’s budgie-smugglers."
"A bracingly chilly evening in Hobart. Mizzling rain is falling. A firework zips into the sky over the River Derwent (timtumili minanya). A flash, a bang, a cascade of golden embers. Glittering reflections scatter across the water. Some among the hundreds of people in the waterfront queues for Hobart’s Dark Mofo winter festival feast look up and catch the moment. Not all, perhaps, are aware of the significance of the event. Created by the Australian artist-pyrotechnician Alex Podger, Memorial is a celebration of human impermanence in a single firework. For those who have chosen to be involved with the project, it is also an act of catharsis: each firework contains the ashes of a loved one. Among the lives celebrated with a firework was that of Christopher Russell, who died on 4 February, aged 92. His wife, Elsbeth, and their daughters, Amy and Wynne Russell, took part in the Memorial ceremony on a floating jetty. “Honestly, if Dark Mofo hadn’t proposed this way of celebrating his life, I wouldn’t have organised anything,” says Amy. “I’ve been too depressed since he passed away. This artwork gave me a powerful and beautiful experience as well as a commemoration of my father. I felt that the community was celebrating Dad.” It rained steadily the entire day prior to the firework being released. “We worried that the event would be cancelled, but were reassured that it was a very powerful firework,” says Amy. “The rain created a universe of sound, water and darkness. It seemed miraculous to me – a blessing.” At the beginning of the ceremony, participants are welcomed to Country by Palawa elder Uncle Dougie Mansell. “It was one of the most beautiful and significant parts of the ceremony,” Amy recalls. “He described the Sky Country of the ancestors to which our loved ones travel. I couldn’t have imagined a more beautiful image. Really, the event was a gift to my family.” The idea for Memorial was sparked by Podger’s lockdown experience of London. He’s been based there throughout the pandemic and was unable to travel to Hobart. “I spent much of the nine months of lockdowns walking through cemeteries in different seasons, watching beautiful stone monuments slowly being tipped over by tree roots or buried under snow,” he says. “Does anyone remember those names now, written 100 years ago? But imagine how loved they were back then.” For Podger, those graveyards were a reminder that the deceased live in memory, not in carved marble or granite. “I’m not saying we shouldn’t build monuments, but maybe that we should just revel in the beauty of a single, beautiful moment and remember that fondly.” After the ceremonies on shore, the firework is taken by boat from Hobart’s Elizabeth Street Pier to the launch site. “The boat that takes the ashes represents the journey souls take across a river in a few different mythologies,” Podger says. “There is something profound about watching a boat disappear across the dark water carrying something so important.” For Wynne Russell, Amy’s sister, it was a powerful event. “I was so moved to see the red light of the little boat carrying his ashes away through the darkness, reflected in the water with the green lights of the harbour markers. His own crossing of the dark waters – even if not of the River Styx. The attendant raised the little red bag of ashes high in her hands like a priestess. It was so wonderful to just be able to be silent and watch him glide away.” The pyrotechnics of Christopher Russell’s memorial lasted a few seconds. “The firework itself was exquisite, a single golden chrysanthemum of light,” says Wynne. “I feel that such a moment of beauty is the only memorial I could ever want for him. It felt perfect to consign him to water and air and light.” Amy agrees. “I’m not sure how I felt, but all the pictures show that I was smiling joyfully,” she says, adding that immediately after the firework flowered and then drooped towards the water, there was “a moment of clarity without thought”. Wynne and Amy’s mother, Elsbeth, says it was an “absolutely beautiful night-time event” with a moving contrast between light and dark that Christopher would have loved. She says there is no competition between the evanescent quality of Memorial and a more fixed resting place for the rest of a person’s ashes – she is looking forward to her and her husband’s ashes eventually being commingled at a family property on Matinicus Island, an isolated island off the coast of Maine in the US. “But a firework is a beautiful way to pay tribute to each individual’s exceptional qualities,” Elsbeth says. Though the ceremony is intensely personal, the explosion can be seen and heard across the city of Hobart, says Podger. “I’m hoping people will take a moment to respect the grief and loss of others, and that there might be a moment of shared compassion, a pause, across the city. “I think we get so tangled in our own lives now that we sometimes forget to respect the struggles of other people.”"
"I had done some TV before and a friend told me about a fly on the wall series that needed a male doctor. I thought: “What have I got to lose?” Originally, though, the show was called Embarrassing Illnesses, but after pressure from us doctors, the producers changed it. We shouldn’t be calling illnesses embarrassing. Myself, Dawn Harper and Pixie McKenna had meetings with the producers to talk through the cases each week. If we thought something was inappropriate, or a patient was particularly vulnerable, we wouldn’t use them. We drove the producers mad with our constant back and forth, but people came on the show because they felt they knew us – there’s a lot to be said for seeing a doctor you trust. Some people felt let down by the health service, particularly with things such as wonky boobs, which the NHS might consider just cosmetic. I think we were a lifesaver for some people who were told by their GP that there was nothing that could be done. We also got people who wanted to be the person to portray the disease they had and raise awareness, knowing others with it were hiding away, just as they had done for many years. We didn’t meet the patients until the cameras were rolling. Our Live from the Clinic show, first introduced in May 2011, was genuinely live. We used Skype to diagnose patients, which at the time was quite revolutionary. There was a lot of criticism from medics who said we should examine patients face to face, but a lot of people find it easier to talk over camera. I don’t want to say I told you so, but look where we are now. The best moments were my personal diagnostic triumphs: spotting rare conditions and knowing exactly what they were. There was a little girl called Charlotte who came to me with bad verrucas. This was actually the sign of a new, unseen immunodeficiency (weakened immune system). I am proud of spotting that. She went on to have a bone marrow transplant. It’s amazing the show is still being watched. There’s a natural voyeur in all of us: we want to see behind the curtain. It’s also partly to feel better about yourself and think: “I’m glad I don’t have that.” I’m permanently bemused by the fact it was so successful, because it’s just my job and it’s not that interesting. But people love medical stuff. And we certainly didn’t hold back on what we showed.  I’d made quite a lot of shows involving surgery, so I wasn’t squeamish. The show was all about dispelling myths. We were creating this really definitive, strong visual identity. It felt groundbreaking. We filmed series one in a penthouse in Birmingham. It had this amazing central living space that we turned into the reception area and made look really glamorous. The rooms in the apartment became the consultation rooms. The format was to follow four main stories from the clinic throughout their treatment. We put ads in GP surgeries to find patients: they weren’t paid. We also got the doctors to do immersive stunts. Christian swallowed a pill camera so you could see a digestive system. Dawn had a smear test and Pixie had a polyp checked. There were mixed reactions when it came out. It certainly felt new and some of the content was probably quite shocking, although we were never gratuitous. I think people liked it because it was brave and honest. It really grew a following and some of the campaigns we did, such as for testicular and breast cancer, were life-changing. The show made me feel a huge amount of humility and compassion for people whose lives are devastated by ill health. Ultimately, it was about the contributors, and making them feel comfortable and relaxed. We had a really high-level duty of care. It gave me a lot of respect for the medical community – and as a series we relied on them. It was real, factual information wrapped up in a fun format, so it needed to feel entertaining – not in terms of laughing at people, but just upbeat and positive."
"Ahead of the holiday weekend, Kamala Harris “took some unfriendly fire from some of those who do not enjoy her work”, said Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday, the only host to air following the Memorial Day weekend. Republicans “cranked the fake outrage knob up to 11” after the vice-president tweeted “enjoy the long weekend” with a professional photo of herself. “Of course, the Maga-verse was furious about this,” said Kimmel, such as former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, who called the vice-president “unprofessional” and “unfit”. “This is the same Nikki Haley who said nothing when Trump said he prefers war heroes who don’t get captured,” Kimmel fumed. “That was OK, no comment there. But tweeting ‘enjoy the long weekend,’ makes you unfit, when the truth is, you know who’s unfit? This guy is,” he said over a photo of Donald Trump on the golf course. Kimmel also touched on outrage over comments by the former national security adviser Michael Flynn at an event organized by followers of the QAnon conspiracy movement. At the “For God & Country Patriot Roundup” conference in Dallas, Flynn was asked why the coup in Myanmar, in which the military overthrew a semi-democratic government and cracked down on dissent following a contested election, couldn’t happen in the United States. Flynn, who suggested in December that Trump could invoke martial law to overturn election results in several swing states, answered: “No reason, I mean, it should happen here.” Since the February coup, the military in Myanmar has imprisoned thousands of protesters and killed hundreds more, Kimmel explained, “and General Eisenhower up there thinks we should do that here, too. Although after it was suggested he be court-martialed for that remark, Flynn tried to walk it back.” “Let me be VERY CLEAR – There is NO reason whatsoever for any coup in America [sic],” he posted on the messaging app Telegram, “and I do not and have not at any time called for any action of that sort.” “Except for this weekend, when you did it on video,” said Kimmel, “and the times you did it leading up to January 6th. Maybe that’s the Bill Gates micro-chip making him say that.” And finally, according to Maggie Haberman at the New York Times, Trump believes he’s going to be reinstated as president in August after Arizona finishes its unhinged, conspiracy theory-laced election audit, “which is so completely insane and dumb, it has to be true”, said Kimmel. “We’ll know for sure once we hear him deny it.”"
"We all love to rag on the poor old internet, including myself. It’s a time waster, it’s corrupting the youth, Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment somehow. But it’s not like we were all doing anything that great before we were online either. I mostly just sat around on an inflatable green couch rereading Garfield comics, and the day my parents got the internet at our house, the first thing I did was type www.garfield.com into the address bar to pick up where I left off. Everything on this list made me laugh the first time I came across it and also made me laugh just thinking about it. Some of them are very recent, some of them are like nostalgic memories that seem lost to time until I remember everything is online forever and I can just look them up right now. There’s a same-iness to comedy videos that are made for Facebook, mostly because for some reason we all decided that the only way to go viral is to put the conceit of the sketch in big block letters, like someone with a megaphone standing next to you yelling THIS IS THE JOKE right in your ear. But there’s a looser, more freewheeling type of comedy video that tends to go well on Twitter and Instagram which I really get a kick out of. There’s no pressure for the video to be “relatable” – just funny. This one by American comedian and actor Jamie Linn Watson is a great example of the form, about a girl who for some inexplicable reason gets toilet water all over herself, and tries to be cute about it. This tweet is better than any space film. And I bet someone saw it and is pitching it around trying to make it into a space film. But even if it does get made, it won’t be as good as this tweet. Perfect storytelling. This is by a sketch group called Please Don’t Destroy and I’m a big fan of their stuff. Their Twitter videos are super lo-fi, shot on a phone and everyone talks over each other; all the things you’re not meant to do in TV comedy. I love it. This sketch is about a guy who gets the memo for the office Casual Friday very wrong. There’s something so funny about people who don’t own up to their mistakes and instead dig in their heels; the type of people who are wonderful in comedy and infuriating in real life. It also features the funniest thing you can say before punching another person. I mainlined way too many funny animal videos in the mid-to-late 2010s, to the point where today I get no joy from them at all – a type of overexposure similar to what we went through with Jennifer Lawrence films around the same time. Well, this bird on a bird may have found its way into my deadened heart. You simply have to applaud a bird for discovering a life hack for getting around. I just keep imagining it having its big Neil Armstrong moment as it stepped on to the other bird’s back and realised what it was about to do. A trendsetter. In five years’ time, all the birds will be getting around like this. Or at least half of them will be. Speaking of sad animal videos, when I was writing this I tracked down an old favourite video of a bear at a zoo waving to people in a car which I used to find hysterical, and when I saw it my first thought was: “Oh noooo, that bear is probably very sad.” I am happy to report that my other favourite bear video remains as perfect as it was when I first laid eyes on it as a uni student in 2007. Watch it with sound on. Ben Russell is one of Australia’s best comic performers and is on my list of Why The F*ck Doesn’t This Person Have Their Own TV Show Yet (TV execs, if you’re reading this, HMU). This is a pitch-perfect parody of those classic blokey lifestyle shows that takes a very dark turn. I reckon if they aired this on 7mate, no one would blink an eye. Michelle Wolf’s TV show The Break proved that white men in suits behind desks weren’t the only people who could host late-night shows. Sometimes white women could do it, standing up, wearing sneakers! It was sharp and cool, the sketches were top notch, and like many other cool shows before it, it was cancelled after one season. The creators of The Onion pivoting to Clickhole was such a genius move. They went from parodying straight newspaper formats to parodying the viral news sites right at the exact moment we all started losing our minds and began the moderately fast slide into online insanity. It’s completely absurdist nonsense, which is all our melted pea brains can process any more. Do not look for meaning in this. It’s not there. I’ve included this one because I thought maybe you might have forgotten about it, and now you’ve remembered it, and I hope it makes you as happy as it makes me. In case you are a 15-year-old and you were a baby when this happened, BBC News mistakenly grabbed a man waiting in their lobby, thinking he was an expert on digital music. He was not, but he did the interview anyway. A lovely reminder that everyone is winging it, all the time. I have a deep suspicion that when teachers audition kids for school choir and sort them into parts, it’s not so much about vocal range as it is about first impressions. Are you destined to stand up the front belting out the melody in your little blonde pigtails, or are you condemned to sing alto, to drone the weird unsexy harmonies that no one wants to hear? I was an alto kid. Now, at Christmas, I play it on repeat and sing this part loudly. Alto kids, rise up. "
"You might be forgiven for skipping past Thoroughbreds in your Netflix recommendations. With a fairly nondescript title and an anodyne poster image, it appears to be about something dull like horse racing. But give it a chance and you’ll discover a dark and nihilistic nightmare, suggesting that casual murder is as prevalent among the wealthy as hedge funds and country clubs. Amanda (Olivia Cooke) and Lily (Anya Taylor-Joy) are estranged childhood friends, brought together under the pretext of a tutoring job, which, it quickly transpires, was set up by Amanda’s mother to encourage her daughter to socialise. Before long, the tutoring gig serves its purpose, giving way to a genuine bond as the two old friends reconnect. Amanda, however, is awaiting trial for animal cruelty: in a grisly show of mercy, she euthanised a horse and became a social pariah as a consequence. She confides to Lily that she is unable to feel any emotion. Her choice of confidante is a judicious one as Lily also holds little regard for society’s rules, frequently bending the truth and showing no remorse when she is caught out. Lily lives with her mother and deeply unpleasant stepfather, Mark (Paul Sparks). Her relationship with him is one of low-key hostility and barely sustained tolerance. Mark has a short fuse, but is mostly smug and passive aggressive, never letting Lily forget whose house she lives in. Lily is more direct, drinking Mark’s expensive wine and sabotaging his beloved bike. Their repeated clashes prompt Lily and Amanda to conclude that the only logical course of action here is murder. So in the classic Hitchcock tradition, they plot a motive-free, alibi-reliant demise and recruit the services of local drug dealer Tim (Anton Yelchin) to help out. Dynamite performances from Cooke and Taylor-Joy are the key to Thoroughbreds’ success. Originally envisioned as a play, much of the film’s first half is simply Amanda and Lily becoming reacquainted and demanding of each other an honesty they withhold from the rest of the world. The fact this honesty manifests in such a dark perspective, taking no issue with equicide, homicide or step-patricide, makes it completely engrossing. Yelchin is also fantastic, cutting a greasy and dishevelled figure, like he just got dragged through a hedge. Thoroughbreds was one of Yelchin’s final performances before his tragic death in 2016, and he excels at making Tim both utterly skeevy, yet somehow sympathetic. Sure, he might be about to kill a stranger for a wad of cash, but he’s out of his depth and blissfully unaware of how seriously he underestimated his new acquaintances. Erik Friedlander’s percussive, syncopated score is also worthy of mention. The intense drumming and screeching strings conjure an ominous atmosphere that unnerves and bolsters the edgy tone. Despite Thoroughbreds horsey motif, the title also applies to Amanda and Lily’s privileged lifestyle. There’s nothing new, of course, in equating high society and the pursuit of capital with immorality: Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott’s 2003 documentary, The Corporation, suggested the attributes needed to succeed in business are the same traits as those found in a psychopath, while Brian Yuzna’s body horror classic Society and John Carpenter’s paranoid masterpiece They Live both suggest an inherent lack of humanity in the wealthy elite (in this case, because they’re aliens). However it’s always refreshing to see a new take on the idea, and Thoroughbreds asserts that detachment from “real life” goes hand in hand with murder: after all, Amanda’s clinical reasoning for killing Mark is simply that it’s a cost/benefit exercise. Thoroughbreds’ marketing heralds it as a dark comedy, but I’d argue that is misleading. If anything, Thoroughbreds is a psychological thriller, although it doesn’t fit neatly in any box. Effectively directed by Cory Finley, it’s a character-driven film with a dark centre, which, coupled with a bit of well-calibrated misdirection, makes it unpredictable and utterly compelling throughout."
"Christina Hendricks appears on our video call with the most dramatic backdrop. Art deco gold peacocks bedeck a black wall, making her look, as she has so often in her career, a bit too good to be human. Perfectly poised, perfectly framed, perfectly lit, she is more like a dreamy vision of what humans look like. “I, erm, like your wall,” I say, pointlessly. She flashes a smile, as if to say: “Obviously.” We are here primarily to discuss the comedy-drama series Good Girls, the fourth season of which will resume in the US this month after a midseason break. The elevator pitch would be Breaking Bad for girls: three suburban women, each hovering on the edge of bankruptcy, unite to embark on a life of cack-handed crime, only to discover they are good at it. The ensemble – Hendricks, Mae Whitman, who plays her sister, and Retta, their friend – works strikingly well, their pacey comic rapport instilling a sense of perpetual motion. You just can’t imagine Good Girls ending. Every time a plot line seems to be reaching its climax, something worse – and funnier – happens. “It’s funny you say that, because originally, when I read the pilot script, I thought: ‘I love this, but I can’t imagine this being more than one episode,’” says Hendricks. “It felt like it finished itself.” She is unsentimental about it. Hendricks wasn’t looking for a new show – “I was happy doing films, taking my time” – but went into it with her eyes open. It is a network drama, for NBC – it is shown on Netflix in the UK – so producers are always aware that “it’s going into every house in the US on a Thursday or a Sunday and a family is watching it. They’re much more careful about numbers and advertisers and people being offended or not getting it. A cable show is much more: ‘We trust this creator – they’re a visionary.’” It has a conventional tone – however dark the material, it is handled very lightly. Yet you can’t help but notice some hard-boiled social commentary from the off – if it weren’t for the bracingly callous US health system, the generation of wage-stagnation casualties and the patriarchy, none of the characters would have gone anywhere near a supermarket heist. More than Breaking Bad, it reminds me of Roseanne and the golden age of US mainstream comedy, when you could be poor on TV without that being a breach of good taste. The 46-year-old has been a household name for almost 15 years, thanks to Mad Men. She was born in Tennessee, where her mother was a psychologist and her father worked for the Forest Service, and educated in Oregon and then Idaho. She didn’t have time for formal acting training; by the time she was 18, her modelling career had taken off. Later, when she had a manager, she took acting lessons: “I did that for almost a year and a half and put auditions on ice. Then I was watching a film – I don’t even remember what film it was or who was in it – and I thought: ‘I’m ready. I can do this.’” She has the most insistent work ethic; as she describes her life’s trajectory, she notes diligently the jobs she had while she was at high school, at a hair salon and a menswear shop. In 2007, she appeared as Joan Holloway in Mad Men. She played the role for the next eight years, her character growing around the depth she brought to it, until by season seven she was almost the central part. In the early 2010s, Hendricks was talked about constantly, although she says the original focal points of obsession were the male characters: “Men started dressing like Don Draper and Roger Sterling. Suits came back in, skinny ties came back in. It took three to four seasons and then all of a sudden people wanted us [the female stars] on magazines. We were like: ‘This is strange – we’ve been doing this for a while.’” Hendricks, along with January Jones, who played Betty Draper, came to represent so much. There was a great deal of rumination on their physicality, Jones as elegant as an afghan hound, Hendricks like the pin-up painted on the side of a bomber. What did it mean, people asked, that in the middle of the 20th century there were multiple ideals of the female form, whereas in the 21st century there was only one? How did that complicate the perception of gender equality as a steady march towards the light? Thousands of column inches went on that question – but, from the actor’s perspective, it was an annoying distraction. “There certainly was a time when we were very critically acclaimed, and getting a lot of attention for our very good work and our very hard work, and everyone just wanted to ask me about my bra again. There are only two sentences to say about a bra,” she says. The signal impression the show left was of an ensemble at the peak of its creativity: actors, writers and the creator, Matthew Weiner, working in almost telepathic unison. It won the Emmy for outstanding drama series four times in a row, but the more notable year was 2012, when it was nominated for 17 Emmys (and didn’t win any of them). The take-home was: everyone involved with this is absolutely brilliant. That harmonious picture was blurred two years after the show ended, when one of the former writers, Kater Gordon, accused Weiner of sexual harassment. Marti Noxon, a consulting producer on Mad Men, concurred that Weiner had created a toxic environment and said that he was an “‘emotional terrorist’ who will badger, seduce and even tantrum in an attempt to get his needs met”. Hendricks takes this head on, in a considered, straightforward manner. “My relationship with Matt was in no way toxic,” she says. “I don’t discount anyone’s experience if I wasn’t there to see it, but that wasn’t my experience. Was he a perfectionist, was he tough, did he expect a lot? Yes. And he would say that in a second. We were hard on each other.” It is impossible, from this distance, to adjudicate on Weiner’s character, but Hendricks’s response reveals something of hers. The easiest response in this situation, and the one 90% of actors give, is: “No comment.” Hendricks is always collected, never evasive, doesn’t gabble. She reminds me powerfully of Joan Holloway – and I am sorry to say it, because she insists throughout: “I’m an actress. I am completely not Joan. Not in any way. I wish I was more like Joan.” I wonder if, while we were all fixating on Joan’s bras and whether or not, in the asinine words of Lynne Featherstone, the UK’s equalities minister in 2010, she represented a “curvy role model”, the audience was responding to Joan’s deeper life lesson – that self-possession is 9/10ths of the law. What Hendricks emphatically doesn’t do is minimise the existence of sexism and sexual harassment in the industry: “Boy, do you think anyone in the entertainment industry comes out unscathed and not objectified? I don’t know one musician or one model or one actor who has escaped that. I have had moments – not on Mad Men; on other things – where people have tried to take advantage of me, use my body in a way I wasn’t comfortable with, persuade me or coerce me or professionally shame me: ‘If you took your work seriously, you would do this …’ “Maybe it was my modelling background, but I knew to immediately get on the phone and go: ‘Uh oh, trouble,’” she says. “That’s where it’s very much a job. We need to talk to the producers and handle this professionally.” Yet, at the same time, she is defensive of her industry. “It gets a lot of attention because people know who we are. I’m sure there’s a casting couch at the bank down the street, I’m sure the same thing happens in management consultancy, but people don’t know who the management consultants are.” Modelling always sounds like a harsh environment – predatory photographers vying with stringent agents to give everyone a complex about their thighs and stop them eating carbs. But that is not how Hendricks describes it at all. Her career sounds like one out of an 80s Judy annual: innocent and hearty, good for pin money and travel opportunities. “I think I was lucky – I didn’t start when I was 14. When I was about 18 or 19, I went to Japan for the first time, I went to Italy. We’d be lots of girls, sharing a house, and I sort of became the den mother. I’d make everyone egg salad sandwiches and greek salads, going into this mother hen role.” That is what they say about being taken hostage: if you want to survive, choose someone to look after. “Oh,” she says, coolly. “I wouldn’t consider being a model as being a hostage.” She was only ever medium-successful, she insists – an “unusual and quirky” hire, rather than the slam-dunk face of everything. About as far as it went was that she never had to get another job to supplement her income. Probably the most famous image of that era in which she was involved was the poster for American Beauty. Two models were in the frame, so they took a photo of the stomach and the hands of each. In the end, they used Hendricks’s hand on the other model’s stomach. It sounds like a clunky metaphor, but it is true. During this period, she moved to London with a friend, for the hell of it, living in a flat on Gloucester Road, “surviving on cider and hummus”. It is a glimpse of the oddball she says she was growing up, the outsider as whom she is rarely cast. This has been the story of her CV. “Early on in my career, I would get auditions and I would call my manager and say: ‘I would never cast me in this – she’s a cheerleader, she’s a bimbo. Can I audition for the other one, the weird doctor?’ And they’d be like: ‘No, they saw your picture.’ And I started realising that people didn’t see the weird, goofy me that I saw.” She made the jump from modelling to acting via adverts, with what looks like fairytale ease. In fact, it was “a lot of pounding the pavement and showing up for auditions and getting rejected – and learning, as a young woman, to not take that personally”. By the late 90s, she was the face of ultimate female confidence, the woman who drinks Johnnie Walker and doesn’t need a chauffeur (these are two ads, not one for drink-driving). “I always thought of modelling as freeze-frame acting. It felt like a scene, and I still consider it that way. There are so many technical things that I think people don’t notice. They see you playing dress-up.” From the commercials, she learned “how to hit a mark, how to memorise a line”, but acting wasn’t novel. She had been doing community theatre since the age of 10, and grew up expecting an alternative life, supplementing an art-house existence any which way. She never amplifies her creative urges. She is much happier talking about professionalism and graft, but that is strategic more than anything else. “I am incredibly emotional and I take things very personally. But I’ve learned to be a little bit of a politician and a little bit of a producer along the way. As a female actor, the easy go-to is: ‘She was emotional, she was hysterical.’ It can be a million other people’s fault, but it’s easy to point your finger at an emotional artist. So, I realised: if I’m going to be taken seriously, I need to have professional perspective and I can cry about it to my friends later.” Yet she cares deeply about creativity, as is clear when she talks about Mad Men. “It may eclipse anything I ever did. And, if it does, it was a good one and I’m proud of it,” she says. “I got to bring who I was as a woman. I think I learned some of how to be a woman from Joan. No one would give a shit about me if it wasn’t for that show. I’d still be doing good work, but no one would have found me. If that’s the best thing I ever do, it was pretty good.” Season four of Good Girls resumes in the US on NBC on 24 June. Seasons one to three are available in the UK on Netflix"
"I’ve seen a LOT of standup. But I still think one of my favourite sets I’ve seen is one I wasn’t there for personally: John Mulaney’s Kid Gorgeous at Radio City special. Everything is there – unique ideas, phrasing, performance. One night in 1995, I saw David Cross and Bob Odenkirk in a tiny club in Santa Monica. I was crying laughing. The one that really stuck with me was “Asshole at a Party”, where David ended the sketch by eating broken glass and turning Bob’s priest character into his personal slave. Nothing in recent memory made me laugh like Tim Robinson and Sam Richardson’s Detroiters. The day it didn’t get picked up for a third season, a part of me died! (The part that liked Detroiters.) The Naked Gun, by myself, in 1988. When Leslie Nielsen broke the penis off of the statue and rushed a screaming woman with it, I was wiping tears off of my face. Paul F Tompkins: he does standup, sketch, characters, improvisation – and is the funniest at everything he does. After being heckled, I dared the heckler to come onstage and be funnier than me. He came up and started reading poetry from his journal. “I wrote this on 9/11,” he opened, taking a pause, “...2006.” For some reason, a lot of my dreams involve me sitting on the toilet and people accidentally barging in to find me. This should be funny, but it is not! It adds a lot of stress to my nights. I hope the other people in my dreams are not dreaming this themselves. That would be mortifying! I recently read John Hodgman’s Vacationland, and, after the first chapter, had to text John to tell him I thought it was not only the funniest chapter I had ever read, but might be the funniest THING I had ever read. The rest of the book doesn’t disappoint. The first date I went on with my wife was at a place called “Sushi ‘n’ Tap.” The waiters would deliver you California rolls, then do 15-minute tap dance routines at your table. If any server quit, the auditions involved in covering their shifts would cripple the restaurant. Which might explain why, when we tried to return for a second date, the place was no longer there. For some reason, a lot of my dreams involve me sitting on the toilet and people accidentally barging in to find me. This should be funny, but it is not! It adds a lot of stress to my nights. I hope the other people in my dreams are not dreaming this themselves. That would be mortifying! People get snooty about America’s Funniest Home Videos. But there have been many times when Zach Galifianakis and I have relieved stress by putting on a compilation tape and laughing our silly heads off. They still got it! They say comedy should be done in threes, but I’ve always felt it should be done in seventeens. “Fart” is still not only a funny word, but also a funny sound. And they smell funny, too. The trifecta! How many words are all three? I really like jokes that take 10 minutes to tell, with a lot of details, none of which end up being pertinent to the punchline. There’s a joke my friend told me when I was 18 called “tickle your ass with a feather” that, in my retelling, gets more and more elaborate every time I tell it. The disappointment on the listener’s face when they realise they’ve wasted so much time for a disappointing punchline is priceless. And that style has served me well my entire career.

"Pre-internet, it could be hard to find anything out about music, so a record cover might be the only information you had access to. At primary school, I learned that Tubular Bells was in a controversial film called The Exorcist (which at the time I thought was porn). I got the album for its mysterious shiny tube floating in the clouds like a UFO – and the music inside matched that soaring image. The golden age of the vinyl album cover, often enhanced by gatefold sleeves, was long gone by 2008. However, the first album by Fleet Foxes beautifully evokes this era by using Bruegel’s painting Netherlandish Proverbs, which literally illustrates outlandish expressions. It was a return to an age when you would actually buy albums for their covers. The high-concept album art of this psychedelic group, who became jaundiced chroniclers of their own increasing wealth, led me to collect everything by them from Welsh record shops when I was 13. The cover of Animals, with its pig floating over Battersea power station against a lurid sky, defined how I imagined London. With so much discussion of Dylan’s songs as he turned 80, plus the Nobel prize, it seems unfair that many of his sleeves are also great art. Crowded with albums, magazines and that dress, this one conveys his changing mood as he abandoned Greenwich Village folk for rocking Americana in upstate New York. Buying albums for their art is a good idea: I was hooked by the psychedelic joy of this, and accidentally purchased a classic. English art rebels the Grey Organisation worked with De La Soul to create it, getting the band to lie in a circle. A pop art delight. Technically this is a 12-inch single rather than an album but it’s the greatest Smiths cover. The picture is from Jean Cocteau’s film Orphée, about a poet who tries to save his wife from the underworld, but it also echoes the myth of Narcissus who fell in love with his own reflection. This cover is not ironic or clever or referential; it is just very powerful. Smith’s existentially naked, spiritually tormented face is like a sculpture in black and white. Their isolation in blankness is touching and compelling. It tells you a lot in a completely unbuttoned, unshielded way. In art, you cannot beat a good portrait. Reading Patti Smith’s memoir of Robert Mapplethorpe, Just Kids, gives new intensity to the photographs he took for her first album. She looks boyish. In fact, she looks like a Botticelli portrait of a handsome Renaissance youth. But she also has a lean and hungry look, as she faces you with the sensitivity of Rimbaud and the aggression of rock. Reed, behind his impenetrable lenses, appears as both tough and frightened, an image of someone whose life you imagine to be dark, dangerous and poetic. His denim hat and star-stuffed leather jacket add something else: a twist of sexual ambivalence. His covers, including Transformer and Rock’n’Roll Animal, are insidious punk masterpieces. Today, the sleeve of the Velvets’ first album, with its peelable banana by Andy Warhol, is revered, but it was hard to find. Instead I found this, and was fascinated by that pink smoke coming from a New York subway in a hilariously literal interpretation of their name. What decadence did it denote?"
"One of the most important art prizes in the UK is to be split between its six nominees after the Artes Mundi 9 judging panel said it wanted to acknowledge the “exceptional social and economic upheaval” of the Covid-19 pandemic. Artes Mundi – the Cardiff-based biennial exhibition that shows political art – will give £10,000 awards to the South African multimedia artist Dineo Seshee Bopape, Puerto Rico’s Beatriz Santiago Muñoz, the Dominican Republic-born artist Firelei Báez, the American photographer Carrie Mae Weems, India’s Prabhakar Pachpute and the Japanese artist Meiro Koizumi. The usual £40,000 individual prize – the largest visual art prize in Britain – was scrapped by the judging panel, which included curators Elvira Dyangani-Ose, Rachel Kent and Cosmin Costinas. In a joint statement, the panel said they reached a “collective, unanimous decision” to award the Artes Mundi 9 prize to all six participating artists, whose work they said was “powerfully relevant today”. A statement read: “Each artist has demonstrated great resilience in overcoming the many global obstacles that Covid-19 has presented. Collectively, the exhibition speaks to their distinctive and powerful voices in ways that are rich, thoughtful and rewarding.” Nigel Prince, the director of Artes Mundi, who chairs the judging panel, said the decision had been made after hours of debate among the jurors, who wanted to “acknowledge the context in which the artists were working” and, in particular, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The work deals with all sorts of issues that have been accelerated into the social consciousness during the pandemic: privilege and racism and injustices and social inequalities and representation and all of these big issues,” he said. The award had been well reviewed, with the Guardian’s Adrian Searle picking out Koizumi’s three-channel The Angels of Testimony, which focuses on a man who relives the atrocities he witnessed as a Japanese soldier in China and Okinawa, as the standout work. Searle said it “overwhelms everything else in Artes Mundi”. Báez’s paintings were described as “great, hectic, explosive things”, and Bopape’s clay and soil drawings were praised, too. Muñoz’s short films show ing Puerto Rico in the aftermath of 2017’s Hurricane Maria, meanwhile, were described as difficult to follow. Prince confirmed the extra £20,000 prize money had come from the funds that had been saved by not flying in and hosting artists and judges for the award. Artes Mundi is the latest British art prize to not name an outright winner. When the Baltic in Gateshead launched its biennial award for emerging artists in 2016, it confirmed there would be no winner or awards ceremony, with each artist being given a £30,000 commission and a 13-week exhibition. In 2019, the Turner Prize was awarded to Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani after they appealed to the judges to split it evenly in a “symbolic gesture of cohesion” rather than pick out a definitive winner. For last year’s cancelled Turner Prize, £10,000 “Turner bursaries” were awarded to deserving artists . It usually offers £25,000 to the winner. Prince said it was too early to say if the next Artes Mundi, which marks its 20th anniversary, would also be evenly split."
"The reopening of the Museum of the Home in London was met with protests on Saturday calling for the removal of a statue of slave ship owner Robert Geffrye following an intervention by the culture secretary to keep it in place. The museum, in Shoreditch, east London, wanted to take down the statue of the 17th-century trader and former lord mayor of London, who made part of his fortune from the slave trade, from the front of its building. But it decided not to after the charity’s trustees received a strongly worded letter from Oliver Dowden last summer, who has warned museums to “retain and explain” controversial statues. As doors to the Grade I-listed building, formerly called the Geffrye Museum, reopened on Saturday morning following a three-year renovation, it was met with calls from residents, activists and politicians, including the Labour MP Diane Abbott, that “Geffrye must fall”. In a speech outside the museum at the Hackney Stand Up To Racism protest, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington accused its chair of trustees, Samir Shah, of giving in to government pressure. Abbott said: “It’s not too late for Samir to show that he’s a little bit more principled than someone who when ministers say to him ‘jump’ he says ‘how high?’. So I’m calling on Samir Shah and the leadership of this museum to take down this statue, listen to the community.  “Take down this statue because, as we are saying today, Geffrye must fall.” In a public consultation of more than 2,000 people, the majority of respondents said they were in favour of the statue’s removal. The mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said the museum’s board had “turned their back not just on Hackney, not just on anti-racism, but their own staff as well. We know their staff don’t want that statue to have that prominent place on Kingsland Road on this museum and everything it symbolises”. He added: “It represents blood and murder and exploitation over centuries and it should not be standing in Hackney in the 21st century in a prominent position above this museum.” It comes amid a growing row around controversial statues across the country – including the decision of Oriel College at the University of Oxford to keep a statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, despite an independent commission backing its removal. Speaking at the Geffrye protest, singer and activist Jermain Jackman said he is “traumatised every single time I walk past and see an individual, a statue of an individual, glorified, immortalised” on Kingsland Road. “In a borough so diverse, one of the most diverse areas in the country, in a borough that elected its first black female MP, we still have a statue of a slavetrader in Hackney.” Patrick Vernon, the social commentator and Windrush campaigner, said: “I wish that Boris Johnson and Dowden would come to a slave port and see the horrors of the likes of that man and many others that profited on the genocide of my ancestors.” On its website, the museum cites “new legal safeguards” for historical monuments announced in January by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, adding: “In the light of this, the board believes that its original decision [“to keep and explain” the statue] is the only practical option for the foreseeable future.” It adds that the board and museum are “continuing to review, discuss and explore options for the statue” and that it has installed a panel near the statue to tell a “fuller history of Geffrye, including his connections with the forced labour and trading of enslaved Africans, and acknowledging that the statue is the subject of much discussion”. In a statement, the Museum of the Home said on Saturday that it “fully supports the public’s right to a peaceful protest” and that the debate over the statue “raises important questions”. It added: “The museum is continuing to listen carefully to all the issues raised and is committed to being open about the history of Geffrye on site and online and to confront, challenge and learn from the uncomfortable truths of the origins of the museum buildings. “Alongside the debate about the statue, the museum is committed to a transformative programme of structural and cultural change to become truly representative and inclusive, through our new galleries and displays, creative programming, partnerships and workforce.”"
"When I was 17, I was in a female rap trio called the She Rockers. We saw LL Cool J and Public Enemy play Hammersmith Odeon when the 1987 Def Jam tour came to London. Afterwards, we saw Public Enemy in McDonald’s. We went “Oi!” and told them we were rappers, so they filmed us doing a freestyle rap, right there in McDonald’s. The next thing we knew, we were flying to New York to work with Public Enemy’s Professor Griff. After that, I did the rap on the Beatmasters hit Hey DJ! / I Can’t Dance (To That Music You’re Playing), which did so well that I got signed as a solo artist by Rhythm King records. With the money, I bought myself a keyboard, a sampler and a four-track tape machine and started writing songs in my bedroom, one of which was Doin’ the Do. I looped a breakbeat and wrote a bassline, the clavinet/piano parts, then a verse and chorus. Betty Boo was my nickname, because people said I looked like the cartoon character Betty Boop – big eyes and short hair. There are a lot of lyrics. I was a bit of a blabbermouth and self-promoter, but that’s what rappers did then. So the lyrics mention Betty Boo throughout. Also, I’d been to a terrible school and the careers officer told me the best I could hope for was to be a secretary. There’s nothing wrong with that – my mum was a secretary – but I wanted something different, so I channelled my fury into a song of empowerment. “Doin’ the do” basically means I’m getting on and doing things. Much later, someone told me it was a slang expression for cunnilingus. The song was a slow burner, then we got radio pluggers Ferret N Spanner on board and suddenly I was everywhere. I’d loved glam rock as a child so wanted to make an impact with colourful outfits, big silver boots and backing singers with purple hair. Apparently I was the first British female rapper to have a Top 10 hit. I still remember Capital Radio DJs Pat Sharp and Mick’s Brown review of Doin’ the Do in Smash Hits. They liked it but said: “This rap thing will never catch on.” I met Alison when she was in a duo called Hit ’N’ Run. She didn’t have a demo: she just had the song in her head. So we worked on it in the box room of my house. Studios were like citadels then, with huge mixing desks and all that rubbish. They looked like something from Star Trek, so working at home was a nice change. Home-recording was new back then, but I had a sampler and a Commodore 64 computer. We took the first organ chord from the Monkees’ I’m a Believer for the intro. The drums were a mix of James Brown’s Funky Drummer, which was ubiquitous then, and our own stuff. We sampled Reperata and the Delrons’ Captain of Your Ship but sped it up. We also used the tambourine and drum break from Bobby Byrd’s Hot Pants (I’m Coming), which the Stone Roses used on Fool’s Gold. As a young recording engineer, I’d seen producers and engineers make singers do take after take until they burst into tears, at which point they’d all high-five each other. I vowed that if I ever got to produce, I wouldn’t be like that. Alison was very involved in the process and we went with her instincts. We recorded the vocals with a cheap Tandy microphone attached to a broom handle which also recorded the sound of a motorbike going past the house, but we left it in. We redid the chorus in a studio – one of those citadels – but it sounded lifeless, so we brought back the broom handle recording. Pop music at the time had been either really slick Stock, Aitken and Waterman, Jive Bunny or MOR stuff. There was a space for a big, colourful persona like Betty Boo’s and music that wasn’t made by grownups. I always remember a line she had that didn’t make it on the record: “I’ve got plenty and I’m not even 20.”"
"Arts festivals in towns and cities across Britain are suffering just as much as music festivals (Summer festivals are crying out for help – but the Tories don’t want to hear it, 20 June). The one in Wirksworth, Derbyshire, which has taken place for more than 30 years, centres on a “town trail” of more than 130 artists in 100 residents’ homes and public spaces, as well as curated exhibitions, performance, music, food stalls etc. As with a music festival, it takes us many months to put together, but again this year we will not be able to welcome the 5,000 people who used to visit the town on a September weekend. One of the reasons is worry about Covid-19 being passed on in people’s homes, but insurance is also a big factor. We just hope that after two years with no festival, people won’t forget us. Carol TaylorChair, Wirksworth festival  I suspect that the reason hordes of sports fans are allowed to sing together in full voice while choirs are still restricted to socially distanced outdoor groups of up to 30 (Letters, 20 June) is that we are governed by a bunch of populist philistines.Jennifer JenkinsLondon"
"Two Sony Music Australia executives, Pat Handlin and Mark Stebnicki, are on indefinite leave from the company, according to reports – a day after Pat’s father, CEO Denis Handlin, was removed as head of the label. The move comes at the same time as an investigation by Sony Music Entertainment’s head office in New York, which is looking into the record label’s Sydney-based branch following multiple complaints about workplace culture. Sony Music refused to comment on reports that Pat Handlin and Stebnicki were on indefinite leave. Guardian Australia has not been able to reach either of the men for comment. Handlin junior is the vice president of A&R (artists and repertoire) across Australia and New Zealand, and was widely tipped to be his 70-year-old father’s successor at the record label. He is engaged to pop singer Samantha Jade, who has released four albums under the Sony label since winning The X Factor Australia in 2012.  Stebnicki is the Australiasian senior vice president in charge of strategy, corporate affairs and human resources. A longstanding friend of the Handlin family, he has worked in various capacities in the human resources area of the Sydney Sony office since 2007. Guardian Australia is not suggesting there are any specific allegations against Denis Handlin, Pat Handlin or Stebnicki. Sony’s Sydney headquarters has been plunged into a human resources nightmare over the past week, with a number of stories breaking in the media, including a three-month investigation by Guardian Australia. In April, one of Sony Music Australia’s most senior executives, the vice president of commercial music Tony Glover, was sacked after an internal company investigation found he had bullied and harassed multiple staff members. Glover has denied any wrongdoing. The New York office subsequently invited employees and former employees to come forward confidentially if they wished to report alleged incidents of bullying or harassment. On 14 June, the Guardian sent a list of detailed questions to the global company’s head office in New York, including multiple complaints about the workplace culture from former employees across two decades, including allegations of bullying, harassment and unfair treatment in the workplace. Former employees also complained about a heavy drinking culture at Sony Australia, allegedly encouraged by senior management, which they believe placed employees at physical and psychological risk. On 16 June, Sony Music Entertainment in New York provided the following statement to Guardian Australia: “We take all allegations from our employees very seriously and investigate them vigorously. These claims only recently came to light and we are examining them expeditiously. Harassment, bullying and other inappropriate behavior is not tolerated by Sony Music at any of our companies and we are committed to ensuring a safe and respectful workplace for our employees. Given our ongoing inquiries, we cannot comment further.” On 21 June, the chairman of Sony Music Group and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment in New York, Rob Stringer, announced to all staff in Australia and New Zealand that Denis Handlin was leaving the company, effective immediately, and thanking Handlin for “his extraordinary contribution to the Company and its artists over his long career in the Australian and New Zealand music industry”. Handlin is also expected to resign as chair of the Aria board. An Aria spokesman told the Guardian: “Denis Handlin is on the Aria board as a representative of Sony Music. As he no longer works at Sony Music, he can no longer be on the Aria board.” Up until Monday, Denis Handlin was the global record company’s longest-serving employee. "
"Dozens of festivals are facing “devastating consequences to their survival” this summer amid confusion within government over how a £1.57bn post-Covid arts fund will affect the sector, parliament’s spending watchdog has found. The influential public accounts committee has called on the government to offer urgent support to outdoor events organisers in a report released on Wednesday. The cross-party committee has revealed that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has not modelled the cost of underwriting festival insurance, despite demands for an immediate intervention. The disclosure comes amid growing calls from across parliament and the music industry for the government to consider providing insurance for festivals against the risk of cancellation. The musician and Womad organiser Peter Gabriel last week urged ministers to intervene because commercial insurers “have run a mile”. A string of events this summer have been cancelled in the wake of Boris Johnson’s decision last week to delay lifting Covid-19 restrictions until 19 July. Meg Hillier, the committee’s chair, said the festival sector and those who work in it were in need of urgent government help. “The pandemic has exposed just how poorly departments across government understand the sectors that they oversee. DCMS was clear that it ‘would not save every organisation’ but we are concerned about the impact of Covid-19 on those organisations vital to the culture sector – sound engineers, lighting and technical support. “The government must urgently consider support other than cash, such as insurance indemnity or parts of the sector risk a second summer of forced inactivity with all the devastating consequences to their survival,” she said. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, announced the £1.57bn culture recovery fund (CRF) 11 months ago with the objective of rescuing up to three-quarters of arts, culture and heritage institutions and organisations at risk of financial ruin because of Covid-19. In a 20-page report examining the distribution of the fund, the committee said the DCMS officials needed a better understanding of the fund’s “impact on freelancers, commercial organisations, supply-chain businesses and festivals”. Highlighting the lack of non-financial support offered to festivals, the report said: “Festivals are making difficult decisions about whether to risk their survival by going ahead this summer, but the department has not modelled the cost of underwriting festival indemnity insurance.” The report comes after a festival pilot was held at the weekend to help measure the impact of testing and vaccines on Covid-19 transmission at an outdoor event. The Download festival saw metal fans who had tested negative for Covid-19 gathering in Leicestershire without needing to wear face coverings or socially distance. The capacity was significantly reduced from its normal attendance of 111,000 to about 10,000. Latitude, which is run by Festival Republic, the company behind the Download pilot, announced on Friday it would be going ahead between 22 July and 25 July in Suffolk. However, Lake District event Kendal Calling has cancelled its 2021 edition, due to take place from 29 July to 31 August with headliners including Stereophonics and Dizzee Rascal, citing a lack of guidance from the government. Other festivals planned for June and July were cancelled or postponed after Johnson’s announcement last week. The Black Deer festival in Kent, which was due to be headlined by Van Morrison at the end of June, the Noisily festival in Leicestershire, and the Kubix festival in Sunderland were also dropped. A Conservative former minister told the Commons on Tuesday of his “fear” that data on large test events has not been published because “it would have demonstrated that we could have safely opened on 21 June”. Mark Harper, who chairs the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said he suspects the numbers from the Events Research Programme are “fantastically positive” after test events held at sporting, music and other venues have not caused any Covid-19 outbreaks and he is “a little confused” as to why the numbers have not been released. “When the government doesn’t publish something it’s normally because it’s bad news and it’s trying to hide it away. “I’ve got a very strong suspicion this set of data is fantastically positive. It must be ready for publication, because it must have been prepared for last week when step 4 was due to be announced so it must be ready to go,” he said. Labour also raised concerns on the whereabouts of the data, which has been gathered at events including the FA Cup final, and asked if there was a “secret”. “Why won’t the government tell the public, tell the industry and tell us what the results are, because all of those who have spent time and money organising and hosting test events – and those relying on this programme – would like to see the results,” said the shadow culture minister, Jo Stevens. The culture minister Nigel Huddleston dismissed their concerns. “Some of the conspiracy theories around this, I’m afraid, I wouldn’t buy into. “We have said already ( …) that if there were major concerns we would have made sure that information was in the public arena that would have been the responsible thing to do,” he said. A DCMS spokesperson said the government would consider calls for insurance policy changes which could be needed once restrictions are lifted. “More help is on the way following a £300m boost to the culture recovery fund at the budget and we continue to explore what further support, including issues around securing insurance, may be required when the culture sector is able to reopen,” she said."
"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it You used to know where you were with zombies. Normally it was 10ft ahead of them, watching them lurch pathetically towards you. This afforded plenty of time to find a baseball bat, something sharp, maybe even a chainsaw. If The Walking Dead, which wraps up after 11 seasons this autumn, has taught us anything, it’s that zombies only really become a problem if there’s a horde of them. It is almost certain that the venerable Swedish-American labour activist Joe Hill wasn’t thinking of zombies when he said “there is power in a union”, but the principle remains the same, regardless of whether we’re talking about workers’ rights or the rise of the living dead. Then zombies started to run, and everything got much more complicated. The debate over whether they should sprint or lurch has raged ever since. It is often said that the arrival of the fast zombie came in 2002, with Danny Boyle’s 28 Days Later. (Pedants might make a claim for 1980’s Nightmare City, a gory hit for Umberto Lenzi, although before his death in 2017, the Italian director would insist that his creatures were irradiated mutants and not zombies.) Before Boyle’s box-office hit, there was no debate about the fast zombie. Afterwards, it often felt like a dam had burst that could never be rebuilt. The fast zombie is frenzied, it never tires, it’s a more visceral enemy. Pandora is out of the box, and she’s hungry for brains. The traditionalists remained, with the zombie movie auteur George A Romero sharing his own thoughts during his 2008 press tour for his latest film Diary of the Dead. “I remember Christopher Lee’s mummy movies where there was this big old lumbering thing that was walking towards you and you could blow it full of holes but it would keep coming,” said Romero. “To me, that’s scarier: this inexorable thing coming at you and you can’t figure out how to stop it … I don’t think zombies can run. Their ankles would snap!” The debate has been reinvigorated by last month’s release of Zack Snyder’s saggy zombie heist movie, Army of the Dead, a film that should be better than it is, as any film featuring a zombie tiger should. Against the backdrop of a ruined Las Vegas, Snyder’s zombies hop, skip and jump at speed. Snyder has form at this sort of thing. He made his film-making debut in 2004 with a fast-zombie remake of Romero’s very own 1978 shambler Dawn of the Dead (the troll!). Yet Romero was hardly puritanical in his vision of the undead. Prior to his death in 2017, he was reportedly working on Road of the Dead, a film in which zombies have learned how to drive. Let’s leave the final word to British film-maker Jed Shepherd who, as the co-writer of 2020’s best horror movie, the Zoom-based chiller Host, knows a thing or two about the ominous. “If you go back to the origins of zombies in Haitian folklore,” he says, “they’re slow because they were designed to be submissive slaves that did the hard work for the people with the skills to create them. Fast zombies aren’t zombies at all.” So what are they? “They’re infected.” Solved!"
"Immersive film footage from one of the most desperate places in Europe, the sprawling Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, is to go on display as part of events exploring 100 years of refugee experiences. The Imperial War Museum in London will on Thursday open displays and installations that were meant to have opened in April but were delayed by the pandemic. They include an exhibition of objects and art telling refugee stories and the immersive film footage, which was captured by the CNN filmmaker Lewis Whyld in February and again earlier this month. Moria was designed for 2,200 people but is home to about 18,000, many of whom have fled the ongoing conflict in Syria. Museum visitors will enter a 30 sq metre space and experience life in the camp on three large wall projections. It is meant to be an unsettling five minutes. “I found it very moving,” said Iris Veysey, the museum’s contemporary conflict curator. “It offers a perspective you rarely see, if ever. By projecting it at scale and showing people going about their ordinary business you get a glimpse of their individuality. “Often people will see refugees on the news and see big headlines and big numbers. But you forget of course that these are just people trying to go about their life and trying to reach safety.” Clearly it is a horrible place but viewers also get a sense of human adaptability, with footage of children happily playing, people making bread, fruit and veg stalls, and men gathering to build a makeshift mosque. “Yes, these places are really hard and really difficult and conditions are very unpleasant but you do see people building communities and building different kinds of spaces,” said Veysey. “It really gives a glimpse into the humanity behind the headlines.” The footage was updated to show the terrible effects of a recent fire which this month destroyed large sections of the camp, leaving more than 12,000 people without shelter. The immersive experience complements the IWM’s Refugees: Forced to Flee exhibition, which displays art, objects, photographs and oral histories exploring 100 years of refugee stories. Some of the objects are mundane – a teddy bear, sheet music, ice skates, a tweed cap. Perhaps not practical when fleeing your country of birth but important to the refugees. “People take very personal things, things which bring them joy,” said Veysey. The exhibition also tells less well-known stories, including what was the largest influx of refugees in British history when 250,000 Belgians fled to Britain during the first world war. They even made a town for themselves near Birtley, Tyne and Wear. Called Elisabethville, it was administered by the Belgian government under strict military law. Contact with the locals was discouraged. After visiting the exhibition people can have a go at applying for refugee status in an immigration booth staffed by an artificial intelligence border guard. It invites you to do a series of tests and make happy, sad, angry and fearful faces to decide whether you are eligible in a new, futuristic world where international movement is policed by machines. Created by artists Anagram the experience, titled A Face To Open Doors, will also visit locations in Manchester."
"Jimmy Kimmel ripped the former president’s thin skin on Tuesday evening, hours after the Daily Beast reported that in the middle of his presidency, Donald Trump pressed advisers and lawyers to use whatever means necessary – Federal Communications Commission, justice department or otherwise – to stop Saturday Night Live, Kimmel and other late-night hosts from mocking him. “Can you imagine that? President Snowflake asked to send the authorities in to stop us from making fun of him,” Kimmel mused. According to the report, Trump’s advisers felt the inquires were “more of a nuisance than a constitutional crisis”. “To me, it feels more like a crisis than a nuisance,” said Kimmel. “I don’t know, I’m up here goofing on him, he’s asking the feds to do who the hell knows what.” When informed there was no legal case to be made against comedians, Trump reportedly asked: “Can something else be done about it?” “He can’t take a joke,” Kimmel mused. “He can make one. In fact he’s made several – Eric, Ivanka, Don Jr – but he cannot take a joke.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert opened with the defeat of the For the People Act, the Biden administration’s landmark voting rights legislation, in the Senate on Tuesday. A Senate procedural vote on whether to start debate on the bill ended as expected in a 50-50 stalemate along party lines, with no Republican support for the measure intended to curb several voting restrictions passed in Republican-majority states. “At long last, that moment that we knew would never happen finally didn’t – just the way we always thought it never would,” Colbert explained. In other news, the Manhattan district attorney’s office is reportedly investigating the former Trump bodyguard Matthew Calamari for alleged tax-free fringe benefits from the former president, such as free apartments, subsidized rent or car leases. “Wait, giving Calamari perks in exchange for his loyalty? That is a clear squid pro quo,” Colbert quipped. The DA’s office is also looking into the bodyguard’s son, Matthew Calamari Jr. “Like his father, Calamari Jr hasn’t been officially charged yet but prosecutors recently advised both men to hire lawyers,” Colbert said. “You know the world is upside down when the Calamari are ordering lawyers for the whole table.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers responded to Trump’s 2019 question on whether anything could be done to stop comedians from making jokes at his expense. “Well, Donald, I’m pleased to announce the answer is yes,” Meyers riffed. “Here is my offer: when Broadway comes back in the fall, you play Willie Loman in Death of a Salesman. That’s it. That’s all you have to do. “If you play Willie Loman in Death of a Salesman, we will not make fun of you on Late Night for the rest of the year,” he continued. “But you have to be off-book. If you forget your lines or more likely don’t read the script in the first place, you just have to make something up. You just have to make up a plot of whatever you think Death of a Salesman is about. And if you’re wondering what the catch is, there isn’t one. This is just something I personally would really enjoy seeing. “And if you don’t do this then I’m sorry, it’s eclipse city in the graphics department,” he added beside a photo of Trump ill-advisedly staring into the full solar eclipse in 2017. Meyers also touched on reports that the Manhattan DA’s office is looking into the former Trump bodyguard Matthew Calamari: “Prosecutors aren’t sure if they really want Calamari, or if he’s just something to pick at while they wait for the main course.” And last week, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill into law that would allow residents to carry a handgun without a license. “So the next time the electrical grid collapses, you’ll at least feel like you have power,” Meyers quipped."
"Over the past year, the traditional sounds of the festival summer – the drone of guitar feedback, the smack of drumstick on snare – have been silenced by the pandemic. On Friday, they’ll finally be blowing the dust off the amps at Donington Park, where 10,000 people will be rocking and camping at the Download pilot – an event the industry hopes will herald the return of live music. Yet even once Boris Johnson decides to take the final step to reopening – and it’s looking like that will now be in July – there are plenty of hurdles to overcome before Britain sees another summer of festivals. Shortages of tents, fencing, cabins, chairs and even stages are playing havoc with organisers, not to mention a lack of festivals’ most notorious amenity: toilets. “Everything is in short supply,” said Melvin Benn, whose company Festival Republic is organising the pilot. “You can barely get a white canvas tent because the government have got them all for testing centres up and down the country. It’s the same for portable toilets … almost everything.” It’s not just the coronavirus vaccination and testing centres that have scooped up all the available tents, he added. Wedding marquees and the construction boom, which has seen builders scrambling to find scaffolding, are also playing their part. “For Latitude, I’ve got a local farmer who is building dressing rooms for the comedy stage for me out of wooden posts because I can’t get the dressing rooms,” Benn said. “My team keep coming back to me saying, ‘We can’t find this’, but we have to find other solutions.” The third lockdown has already forced some to give up. More than a quarter of the 172 festivals with a capacity of more than 5,000 that had been planned for this year have been cancelled, according to the Association of Independent Festivals. David Farrow, who runs Beautiful Days in Devon, is hoping that this year’s line up of the Levellers, the Orb, James and Hawkwind will go ahead on 20 August, but he has had similar problems. “Our normal stage supplier was the first one to say sorry, we can’t do your job,” he said. After last year when most staging companies lost all their festival business, they looked further afield and some have shipped equipment to the Middle East. “You can’t blame them, because most of their biggest jobs weren’t there last year,” Farrow said. “Toilets are a disposable item really. They get damaged and they don’t last for ever, and fencing too – that gets damaged so it has to be replaced. A lot of that wasn’t manufactured. “I’ve found a company willing to do it for me, but I’ve got to put down money so they can do it. So as long as we do open up, I’m prepared to do that. But I can’t get a Covid insurance policy.” Rising Covid cases and hospitalisations have reportedly led to a four-week delay to the original reopening date of 21 June being discussed in cabinet. That would be ruinous, according to Live, the group representing the live music industry’s 3,150 companies, which says 5,000 events would be cancelled, including about two-thirds of the remaining summer festivals. Adam Gregory, who runs Bloodstock, a heavy metal festival in Catton Park in Derbyshire on 11 August, says he will make a call in mid-July. “Every week that goes by there’s a cost,” he said. “The closer you get, the higher the number and it will go from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. It’s critical that we get clarity on what’s happening and when so we can plan effectively.” There is a further hidden cost, according to Mark Mynett, a senior lecturer in music technology at the University of Huddersfield: the loss of uncounted numbers of stagehands and road crew. Most are freelance – Live estimates about 90,000 – and they were not eligible for furlough or other state support, forcing many to turn to foodbanks and Crowdfunder campaigns. Mynett, who is also a record producer and sound engineer and will do front-of-house sound for some acts at Bloodstock, was angry at the lack of support for his friends and colleagues, so launched the ILoveMetal campaign. “If you look at charity gigs in the past, the crew all gave their time for free to help out when there was a disaster. When the tables were turned, I don’t think there was enough support for them,” he said. “There is a widely-held belief that on 21 June, or maybe a few weeks later, that with the flick of a switch live music will restart. But we’re sleepwalking into disaster, and when people realise the extent of the damage to the music industry, the education and knowledge that has been lost, they’ll ask why we didn’t do more.” Greg Parmley, Live’s chief executive, said: “Our biggest concern is the delay to reopening. The majority of the festival season will go because it destroys any confidence that promoters will have in investing in events. We’re facing a cliff-edge.” The Download pilot is part of the Event Research Programme, which began with the Sefton Park pilot festival in Liverpool last month, and Parmley said that leaks of the data from that event suggested that there had been only 15 Covid cases out of 58,000 people who attended. “We can overcome a lot of challenges but we can’t overcome a government that was very nervous to allow us to go ahead even though the data shows it can,” he said."
"Trevor Noah recapped a bombshell report from ProPublica on Wednesday evening, which revealed just how little the wealthiest Americans have paid in income taxes. The private tax records, which ProPublica published because “disclosing the identities of billionaires who paid little to no taxes in years their fortunes grew by billions of dollars will help readers understand the magnitude of the tax advantages the ultrarich enjoy”, indicate the Tesla founder Elon Musk, for example, paid zero in federal income taxes in 2018. So did Jeff Bezos in 2007 and 2011, the same year he claimed a $4,000 child tax credit. All of this was keeping within the legal tax code. “Imagine being so rich, that you can afford accountants who make you look poor,” the Daily Show host said. “Think about it: Jeff Bezos is so good at hiding his wealth that he qualified for a child tax credit. This dude built his own rocket to take him to space, and the US government is like, ‘hey brother, here’s something for the kid until you can get back on your feet’.” “This is something that everyone already suspected but it’s still shocking to see the proof right in front of you,” Noah said. “Much like wearing cargo shorts to the Pride parade, these tax loopholes are both messed up and completely legal,” he added. “So if you want to change the system, then you need to take action, and write to your congressperson. Then, your congressperson can hold your letter in one hand, and the campaign check from the billionaire in the other hand, and decide which one they want to wipe their ass with.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed criticism levied at Kamala Harris, who just returned from a trip to Central America after Biden tasked her with handling and overflow of migrants at the southern border. (Colbert imagined Biden’s task delegation: “Alright kiddo, let’s divvy up these international trips. I’m gonna go eat, pray, love across the old country, how about you head south of the border, try to solve a problem that no president of either party’s been able to handle for decades.”) The “rockiest” moment of the trip, according to Colbert, was when Harris bluntly told Guatemalan migrants “do not come”, drawing ire from both progressives and Republicans. “So…bipartisanship!” Colbert joked. Republicans had previously attacked Harris for not visiting to get a “first-hand look” at the border. “Yeah, Republicans know that’s how you solve any problem – you go there for a photo-op,” Colbert deadpanned. “It’s like the kids say: pics, or you didn’t fix.” In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel anticipated Joe Biden’s trip to Europe to visit with the leaders of several prominent allies. The president is “hoping to repair some of the damage Trump did to our relationships with our allies”, Kimmel explained. “And it’s exciting for America.” “It’s like introducing our new fiancee to all our friends,” he continued. “You know, we haven’t been as close over the last few years because our ex was a loud, lying cheater who never picked up the check. But now we’ve got a new guy – he’s a little boring, he’s not exactly George Clooney but he treats us well and he doesn’t throw Starburst fruit chews at the other world leaders, so it should be nice.” The trip got off to a rocky start, however, when a swarm of cicadas delayed the White House press plane by seven hours. “If this was a movie, the government would have to go to a cabin in the woods to convince Sully Sullenberger to do one last job,” Kimmel quipped. And on Late Night, Seth Meyers took a closer look at the federal criminal investigation into Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, as audio from a much-scrutinized, damning phone call with Ukrainian leaders was obtained by CNN. Weeks earlier, federal agents raided the former mayor of New York’s home and office for evidence. “I just can’t imagine the feds raiding Rudy Giuliani’s home and office and finding nothing incriminating,” Meyers said. “I mean forget Ukraine and quid pro quos, he’s probably got a fridge full of whitefish he stole from Zabar’s or a sink full of unpaid parking tickets he tried to stuff into the garbage disposal only to remember he doesn’t have one.” As for the phone call, which helped launch the first impeachment of Donald Trump in early 2019, “it was clear that what they were doing was shady and that they knew it was shady”, said Meyers, “because they all talk in that vague, Mafia-esque where they never actually demand something explicitly but they make it very clear that what they’re asking for a is quid pro quo. “This whole thing is yet another reminder of the central thrust of Republican politics right now: cheating in elections to win,” Meyers concluded. “It turns out the biggest criminals are in the so-called party of Law and Order.”"
"The Edinburgh festivals have been offered millions of pounds in emergency funding in the face of widespread fears they may never fully recover from the severe impacts of the Covid pandemic. The Fringe, international and book festivals, which help make up the world’s largest annual arts season, have been forced to very significantly curtail this August’s events, the second year running it has done so. One of the most famous, the military tattoo staged at Edinburgh castle, has again been cancelled. Many senior figures in the August festivals now believe it is unlikely the events will ever return to their record-breaking scale of 2019, when they sold more than 4m tickets over a four-week run, with well over a million people attending events. The international festival will provide only about a quarter of its normal programme this year; the book festival has abandoned its traditional home, a tented city in Charlotte Square gardens in the new town, for Edinburgh’s art school; and the Fringe will dramatically shrink in size this year, with a far smaller number of venues staging events outdoors, on the streets and in open-sided marquees. The Scottish government and the Edinburgh council leader, Adam McVey, insist they are fully aware of the scale of the crisis facing the festivals, which generate up to £1bn a year in income, and the knock-on effects on the city’s economy. But McVey said the immediate priority was coping with the ongoing and “dynamic” Covid crisis. “Edinburgh will still be the home to the biggest arts festival in the world, but for now we’re just going to have to put the city’s public health first,” he said. The Scottish government has offered the cultural sector more than £25m in emergency funding, drawing on Covid relief money from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in London. McVey said the council was also offering a further £300,000 to the city’s smaller arts organisations, to spread out the emergency aid.  Some argue that a more scaled-back festival season would be a bonus: in common with other global tourist destinations such as Barcelona and Venice, many Edinburgh residents found the festival season suffocating, its littered streets jammed with tourists and taxis; squares and parks taken over by late-night ticket-only Fringe venues; and property and rental prices vastly inflated by speculators cashing in on Airbnb rentals. One influential sponsor suggested the enormous scale of the festivals and the continuing growth in audiences pre-pandemic also bred complacency and impeded innovation and self-criticism about the quality of what was offered. Nick Barley, the director of the Edinburgh international book festival, historically the world’s largest, said the pandemic gave the festivals and the city a chance to re-evaluate the scale and type of their events, and to reinvent themselves. “The race is on to do something else, which is to bring numbers back up to a really healthy level but not to the crazy over-festivalised level of 2019,” he said. “This is also an issue which affects Venice, Barcelona, any city which has had tourism and culture as part of this unholy duality, which got slightly out of control in the 2010s. We’re all trying to work out how we can do it in the post-Covid era.” There is broad consensus among festival directors, promoters and political leaders that this year is about survival. Fergus Linehan, the international festival’s director, said that while this August’s events would be much smaller, they needed to “keep the flame burning [and] keep the festival in people’s minds and hearts”. Staging next year’s festivals will be their biggest test, to see whether audiences have overcome their anxieties about mass gatherings. The international festival, born in 1947 amid the deep recession and ruins of the second world war, celebrates its 75th anniversary in 2022. While Fringe producers fear many highly skilled technicians and performers could leave the industry due to the collapse in live performances during the pandemic, Linehan said 2022 could be a vast celebration. Next year’s festival could provide artists and audiences with the chance for a “huge civic moment of everything through from civic celebration to requiem, giving thanks to everyone.” Barley said the crisis had forced his festival to reshape how it staged its events, embracing the digital streaming it was forced to use last year when all of its in-person events were cancelled. One major sponsor, the investment firm Baillie Gifford, which part-owns Tesla and Spotify, has put Barley in touch with a former Spotify executive to develop new ways of monetising the festival online. “That’s the race, and it’s a pretty exciting race. For Edinburgh, the challenge surely has to be how to become the world’s leading hybrid festival city, one which is as good in real life as it is online – whether you’re in the new town or in Texas. If we can crack that then we have a festival city that works for the 21st century.”"
"It didn’t take more than a few minutes after the final whistle of the Champions League final last month for the cameras to find Liam Gallagher in the stands looking sad. It wasn’t really a surprise to see him in Porto – listen to Gallagher and his elder brother Noel speak for more than a few seconds and one of them will mention being a die-hard Manchester City fan. Back when City’s neighbours, Manchester United, were hoovering up trophies in the 90s (and earning a possibly unfair reputation for having more fans in Surrey than the north-west), that Gallagher patronage gave City cool points. But are Man City still the league leaders when it comes to famous fans? Things have certainly changed for United; rappers Dave, Headie One and Stormzy are vocal supporters, and definitely count as cool. Perhaps not as cool as James Bond, Nelson Mandela, Lana Del Rey and a pope – they are, or were, all Liverpool fans. Daniel Craig is regularly spotted at Anfield, Mandela often talked about Liverpool and met the team in 1994, LDR regularly tweets about matches and, while it’s not known if the late Pope John Paul II ever set foot on the Kop, he did tell fellow Pole – and Liverpool keeper – Jerzy Dudek that he was a red. Across Stanley Park, Everton can count Sylvester Stallone among their most famous fans. Down south, and to Arsenal. There’s never been a shortage of celebrity Gooners, with Idris Elba possibly topping any list of cool fan – unless you count Jeremy Corbyn and his successor Keir Starmer as cool? Sadly for Arsenal, Piers Morgan undoes a lot of the good work. Their north London rivals Spurs are AJ Tracey and Adele’s team of choice, which is pretty starry, while Dizzee Rascal is a West Ham fan. Fulham can count Margot Robbie and Hugh Grant among their fans, and though Chelsea have Cara Delevingne, Damon Albarn and Mark Ronson perhaps adding cool points, Jeremy Clarkson, Ellie Goulding and Tim Lovejoy definitely take them away. In the Midlands, Robert Plant’s lifelong Wolves association saw him performing at their Premier League promotion party in 2018. Aston Villa, meanwhile, don’t have musical royalty among their ranks but can boast Hollywood royalty in Tom Hanks and actual royalty in Prince William, although David Cameron pretends to support them, so let’s call that one a scoreless draw.  Across the border in Wales, Wrexham AFC were recently bought by actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, for reasons no one’s quite fathomed yet. Out east, we can’t overlook Delia Smith and her passionate love of Norwich. Like British players in the 80s, if you want some real glamour, you have to go overseas. Namely Juventus, who can probably end this debate – they have Drake and Rihanna in their corner. But I am going to go out on a limb here and say their interest in La Vecchia Signora is fleeting. Which leaves Rotherham United to sneak in with an injury time winner. Paul Chuckle might be their only famous fan, but the club wins solely due to the touching footage of the crowd at the AESSEAL New York stadium chanting “To me, to you” shortly after the death of Paul’s brother, Barry, in 2018. No one else stood a chance."
"One day after the announcement of a $500m reinvention of the Ultimo site of Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum, the New South Wales government has jumped a legal hurdle in the second phase of its Powerhouse plan: an expansion to Parramatta. But with two of the state’s largest unions renewing a green ban to protect a vital area of the proposed site, the state government’s troubles are far from over. On Wednesday, the NSW land and environment court dismissed action taken by a Parramatta residents’ action group, who have challenged the validity of Infrastructure NSW’s environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Powerhouse Parramatta project. The action group argued that heritage considerations had not been adequately accounted for in the selection of the site and the design of the museum, which will necessitate the removal of the 140-year-old mansion Willow Grove, currently protected by a green ban. Willow Grove sits smack in the middle of the proposed $800m project’s site on Parramatta’s Phillip Street. The NSW government plans to relocate it, brick by brick, to an alternative undisclosed site. In his ruling, Justice Tim Moore said there was no obligation imposed on the government to investigate alternative sites for Powerhouse Parramatta, and even if this decision was debatable, there appeared to be no feasible alternative site. Consequently, the removal of Willow Grove was unavoidable, he ruled. He also found that the government’s EIS had complied with all relevant requirements. The legal challenge was launched after the NSW arm of the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) and the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association placed the green ban on Willow Grove late last year, effectively preventing its demolition. That green ban was re-endorsed three weeks ago by 200 union delegates. Outside the court on Wednesday, spokeswoman for the North Parramatta Residents Action Group, Suzette Meade, said an appeal of the decision had not been ruled out, but the NSW government had indicated it would not proceed with any construction on the site until 21 June. “The legal proceedings were always our plan B,” she said. “Plan A has always been the passion and the power of the community and unions working together. “In the spirit of Jack Mundey a CFMEU green ban will save this site and Willow Grove will remain on Phillip Street Parramatta, forever.” Any government attempt to break the ban could potentially lead to widespread industrial action from unions across the state, the NSW secretary of the CFMEU, Darren Greenfield, warned on Wednesday, with 24-hour surveillance of the site continuing to ensure construction does not proceed. “[Today’s decision] doesn’t change our position,” he said. “We will use whatever political means we can. Our green ban and our members will save Willow Grove.” The green ban was also partly made in support of the local Dharug people of western Sydney, who told the Guardian last October they had been cut out of consultation over the museum’s Parramatta site, and feared that the removal of Willow Grove could unearth ancient Indigenous artefacts and the bodies of their ancestors. The residents’ action group, the unions and the Dharug Strategic Management Group do not object to the construction of a museum in Parramatta; they object to the government’s site selection, which continues to threaten Willow Grove and a nearby row of Victorian terraces. Concerns have also been raised over potential flooding, given the site’s location on the banks of the Parramatta River. A statement issued by the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in August said that these concerns were unfounded. But Meade said: “The people of Parramatta shouldn’t have to choose our heritage or cultural funding – we deserve to have both, and the community will continue to fight for this.” The Guardian has sought comment from the NSW arts minister, Don Harwin."
"There was an injection of star power into the Western Australian election this year when the state’s showbiz royalty – Tim Minchin, Ben Elton and Kate Walsh (of Grey’s Anatomy) – stood beside the Labor leader, Mark McGowan, on Fremantle’s historic harbourfront as he announced that Victoria Quay would be the site of a new $100m state-of-the-art movie studio. It is a longstanding dream of the WA screen industry to have a film-making facility to match those in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and the Gold Coast, which are all experiencing unprecedented levels of demand due to the global content boom and Hollywood’s Covid retreat down under. WA wants its part in the gold rush too.  The studio will consist of four soundstages, offices, construction space, parking, set storage and other amenities. What stunned the film community and surprised the port city was where the government and its commercial partner, Home Fire Creative Industries, chose to locate it: not on the fringes of the metropolitan area, where such facilities tend to be found, but smack in the middle of a working port and a cherished heritage precinct. If all goes to plan (no dates have been announced but it’s understood the government wants the studio up and running in two years) Hollywood stars will be soon sharing the space with cruise and cargo ships trading in passengers, motor vehicles and boatloads of sheep. “What is the mad film starry-eyed rush to hand over a substantial part of the tourist and heritage precinct to private developers so that they can build German bunker-style windowless concrete monstrosities that will stop the sightlines to the port from Market and Queen streets?” wrote heritage activist Roel Loopers in an angry letter to the Fremantle Herald. While many in the industry are privately wondering about the wisdom of locating a film studio cheek by jowl with the maritime industry, they’ve generally fallen in behind a plan which will deliver the most important piece of film infrastructure in the state’s history. As Dirt Music producer Kate Separovich put it: “Everyone is supportive, even if questionable decisions are being made.” Leading the charge against the studio is John Dowson, president of the Fremantle Society, a group that in the 1970s successfully stopped the construction of a four-lane highway along Marine Terrace and saved the Victorian and Edwardian-era buildings that gives the city its character. “They are planning to build large concrete boxes with high fences around them on the most valuable waterfront land in Fremantle,” Dowson says. The area contains significant historical artefacts, including the immigration building and wharfies cafeteria, which was built by John Curtin during the second world war. “This is the privatisation of public space. It will also radically change the character of the port, which is a fundamental part of the city,” says Dowson. “We are not against development. We want money spent here because it’s the best way to preserve the city. There are 3,000 heritage-listed buildings in Fremantle, which is more than any other town in Australia. But we want development on the waterfront to be in keeping with the rest of the city.” Acting Fremantle mayor Andrew Sullivan believes if Fremantle is to thrive it needs to be more than just a sleepy heritage area. He says those who want to keep the port as is have a romantic view of such spaces. “It is an industrial landscape. Having another type of industry in that area is more appropriate than, for example, residential or retail,” he adds. Sullivan believes heritage activists’ other worry – over the size of the soundstages – is misplaced. “It is bizarre to be so concerned about scale when you can have a ship the height of an eight-storey building next to the wharf, yet you can’t have a structure that won’t be anywhere close to that height?” While the local screen industry is pleased with the government spend – $100m for the studio and an extra $20m to lure Hollywood productions – many are concerned the location just won’t work. Production designer Herbert Pinter begins our walk around the designated area complaining that he almost didn’t make it due to traffic: “[When you work in film] you have to be able to get here on time,” he says. “A movie studio is not simply a soundstage. You need space. Often you have to build something outside of the soundstage because the scene calls for natural light. You couldn’t do it in [this] area.” Pinter, who is best known for his films with Bruce Beresford and who has worked in studios around the world, believes the Home Fire team can make the area work. “But will it be the world-class facility that you need to attract American film-makers? Will they be willing to travel that extra distance to work in a studio that does not give them everything they need? If we are going to spend all this money we should do it right, and not because it is in a pretty location.” Pinter’s concerns are echoed by an international expert in studio construction and management, who consults to Netflix and didn’t want to be named for this story. “It is a terrible idea,” they say. “You cannot build a studio so close to where ships dock and where there is so much traffic and a train line nearby. The vibrations and the noise will make filming there a nightmare. “And that is apart from the commercial considerations. The mantra ‘build it and they will come’ does not hold water. The Covid surge will not continue and you will struggle to get Hollywood to fly another five hours on to Perth from the east coast. You need to start small and develop the industry before embarking on a studio of this scale.” Neither the government nor Home Fire Creative Industries would comment directly on these criticisms of the plan, which is still in its proposal stage. Once it reaches development, it will be referred to the key stakeholders, including the Heritage Council of WA, Fremantle Port Authority and the City of Fremantle. “All feedback received will be reviewed, in conjunction with the local relevant planning framework and state planning policies, to inform a recommendation for consideration and final determination,” says WA’s minister for culture and the arts, David Templeman. Local producer Amanda Morrison – whose company Komixx Entertainment was responsible for Netflix hit The Kissing Booth – has every confidence in the project, and is anxious for the studio to be completed. “The global market has significantly changed over a short period of time. Western Australians are missing out,” she says.  “Unless we have infrastructure to be able to compete we will not be able to continue growing the industry in this state. We have a number of projects on our slate that we could have shot in Western Australia but without a studio we’ve had to them send them overseas. We need a studio – and we need it right now.”"
"With the European Championships, Lions Tour and Olympics under way or expected to commence soon, the long-anticipated summer of sport is finally here. Not a sports fan, however? Here are some recommendations from key cultural figures for what you can do to avoid the wall-to-wall coverage. New exhibitions at Hauser & Wirth, Somerset We’re so lucky to have an internationally renowned modern art gallery in Somerset, particularly as entry is free and they put on so many activities for families. This summer the gallery is exhibiting the work of Gustav Metzger – the colourful projections look incredible – and in the beautiful grounds they’re showing Eduardo Chillida’s sculptures. We’ll definitely be going along. Stourhead open-air theatre Stourhead is always worth a visit – it really is one of the National Trust’s most stunning properties. This summer they’re doing open-air theatre in the evenings on the South Lawn. They’ve got a theatre group called Three Inch Fools who use music and comedy doing productions of Romeo & Juliet and Robin Hood. It looks like it’ll be really lovely. The Bishop’s Palace Garden festival, Wells I went to school in Wells and always enjoyed the chance to have a wander in the beautiful Bishop’s Palace gardens. As I’ve been doing a lot of gardening since lockdown came along, I’m really looking forward to checking out this year’s garden festival. They’re going to have lots of demonstrations, stalls, workshops as well as food stalls and live music. Worthy Pastures As we couldn’t have a Glastonbury festival for the second year running, we’ve decided to open the farm as a pre-erected campsite during the summer holidays. It’s a great chance for us to give some work to our crew as well as a bunch of the food traders who’d usually be at the festival. And our three supported charities – Oxfam, WaterAid and Greenpeace – will have a field where they’re offering all kinds of activities and workshops for all the family. My Dad (Michael Eavis) actually did camping on the farm before he put on the first festival in 1970 so, in a way, we’re going back to our roots! Pitlochry Festival theatre’s outdoor summer season Of course I’m biased because I have a play on here – Adventures of the Painted People. But while most theatres in Scotland are closed, they have built an amphitheatre in the woods, and you can hear the birds tweeting and the river below becoming part of the story, which makes for a glorious experience. Sound Stage virtual theatre The Lyceum has commissioned eight new audio plays, which audiences can listen to online but include a virtual bar and after-show discussions to make this more of a social event. The plays include Lynda Radley’s The Mother Load, about the friendship between three first-time mothers, as well as Black Diamonds and the Blue Brazil, based on the trials and tribulations of Cowdenbeath football club and what it’s like to support the underdog team. Visit your local hillfort I would recommend the Atlas of Hillforts, which maps hillforts across the UK, including many in Scotland. My favourite thing about visiting a hillfort is that it is a much shorter walk than a munro, but you still have gorgeous views. Kings Seat, near Dunkeld, has been recently excavated. You can connect to people who stood there 2,000 years ago. Night Fever exhibition at the V&A Dundee If, like me, you are at the stage of reminiscing about going to night clubs in the past, you’ll greatly enjoy this exhibition which explores the relationship between clubbing and design from the 1960s onwards. And what better place to see it than Dundee, home of Average White Band and the Associates. Outdoor theatre, GlasgowThere’s something really special about experiencing theatre outdoors. Not only because it reassures people who are worried about being indoors at the moment, but because it takes us back to the way that theatre was often first seen. You get that same sense that the ancient Greeks would have got. It’s amazing – and even if the weather isn’t perfect, most venues will have protection with canopies. Strangely enough, certain aspects of what the pandemic has provoked has actually returned people to ancient traditions – in modern forms. One recommendation is the Citizens theatre and Scottish Ensemble production of Shakespeare’s The Comedy of Errors as part of Glasgow’s Live at No 40 outdoor festival, which has live music, theatre and opera. Go to a garden Another thing the pandemic has given us in a rise in community gardening projects. A lot of people find gardening fundamental for mental health – those who feel like outsiders can join in. And for some, gardening is their sport. It’s a kind of alchemy, a mix of the solitary and the communal. You can flare in your own way. It’s exercise, but unlike some exercise that can feel like it’s going nowhere fast, gardening always produces something. I can’t wait to visit the new RHS Bridgewater gardens in Salford. I’m fascinated because I see so many local people have been involved in the reconstruction of it. It’s really exciting that it’s in this working-class area like Salford, instead of Kew or somewhere like that. I’d recommend visiting any garden nearby – this country has so many beautiful botanical gardens. Just a couple of weeks ago I was in the botanical gardens in Aberdeen which was very moving. The idea of this creation of something from the 19th century that’s still the same in the 21st century is quite healing. Arts and books festivals Edinburgh International Book Festival (14 -30 August) will be mixture of digital, indoor and outdoor events this year. There will be about 250 events and I’ll be going to as many of them as possible. The programme, curated by Nick Barley, is yet to be announced, but it’s always exciting. There’s also Manchester International Festival (1 – 18 July), which is always wonderful and full of surprises. It has a different way of bringing people from all over the world, but at the same time reintroducing us or introducing us to local people. Outdoor poetry, Mancheter HOME in Manchester is building an outdoor space to accommodate people who are worried about coming indoors to watch film or or theatre. I’m programming some events myself – poetry, music, cheese and wine on some Mondays in July and August. I love the combination of poetry and music. Each event will have a musician, a new poet and an established poet, and I’ll be hosting. The pandemic’s put everybody under an untold amount of pressure, with so much anxiety about, so it’s quite nice to think of different ways that people have to enjoy themselves together in a safe way. Having said all that, I do like football. People aren’t either-or – I think we can be a bit bisexual about it and like both sport and culture.  Jean DuBuffet: Brutal Beauty, Barbican DuBuffet is a bit of an outlier. He didn’t start making art in earnest until he was over 40-years-old and he ploughed his own furrow, but in his butterfly assemblages and giant colourful canvases, there’s elements of outsiderdom and psychoanalysis. I’ve not seen a retrospective of his work and so I’m intrigued to see what I make of it. The exhibition also features works from Dubuffet’s collection of Art Brut (a phrase he coined, which translates literally as “raw art”). Michael Armitage, Royal Academy of Arts I saw his exhibition at the South London Gallery two or three years ago and I’m really looking forward to seeing his latest work. The Kenyan-born artist draws from Titian and Gaugin to explore East African culture and identity in an incredibly beautiful and sophisticated way. His colourful, dreamlike paintings are made using Ugandan Lubugo bark cloth which creates these disruptions between the imagery and the substance they’re painted on. He builds his images with a flair and authority that belies some of the shocking content. Matthew Barney, Hayward Gallery, Southbank Centre In his new film, Redoubt, Barney is exploring the Diana myth, which is close to me in that I was in a Diana-inspired show at the National Gallery as part of the Olympiad in 2012. Barney’s a bit of a one-off in terms of these epic film cycles he creates (the film is shown on a loop but approximate screening times are available online) and I’m excited to catch his first solo UK museum exhibition in over a decade. If you don’t know what to expect, I’d say you have to be very open minded. Don’t expect it to obey the rules and grammar of a feature film. It’ll be quite lengthy, around two-hours long but there will be plenty of exposition and colour material at the gallery to help one get a grip on things. Globe Theatre Away from museum spaces, I had the privilege of going to the Globe Theatre in 2018, to see a wonderful production of Othello with André Holland and Mark Rylance. It was an incredibly inspiring and unforgettable experience that made me wonder why it took me so long to get around to going. They’ve got As You Like It, A Midsummer Night’s Dream and The Tempest on this summer and I can’t recommend it enough. There’s something about being at the Globe that gets right to the heart of the theatrical experience. It’s this ersatz building that could be off-putting and elitist, but they carry it off so brilliantly and there’s an unparalleled degree of engagement with the audience. I’m just thrilled to be able to watch actors live!"
"“We’ve seen it in the movies, now let’s see if it’s true.” Cinema has always had a soft spot for the azure skies, sun-blessed landscapes and limpid seas of the ideal getaway destination. Peter Yates’s musical gave us four lads on a very British, of-its-time caper through Europe on a London omnibus, buoyed by that title song, sung by Cliff Richard with a tone of summery longing. In Paweł Pawlikowski’s romance, the ebbs and flows of the relationship between Natalie Press’s working-class Yorkshire teenager and Emily Blunt’s posh rebel are intensified by the lack of structure the holidays bring, enabling transgressive behaviour and, ultimately, damaging flights of fancy. The holiday romance is a mainstay of the summer film, and Luca Guadagnino’s drama captures the lust, joy and transience of the experience, wrapped up in a seductive rural Italian setting. A cultured American teenage boy’s fling with an older man is conducted through meandering bike rides and cooling dips in remote lakes; the film’s languid atmosphere gives it an air of inevitability. Travelling solo can be a lonely affair, as Marie Rivière’s Delphine discovers when her friend bails on her two weeks before their break in Éric Rohmer’s gently observant drama. Flitting from Paris to Cherbourg to the Alps to Biarritz, Delphine struggles to get in the holiday spirit but fate may have plans for her … Bruce Brown’s easy-going documentary posited the summer holiday as a year-round activity, following surfers Mike Hynson and Robert August on the quest for the perfect wave from California to Ghana to South Africa to Australia, and was key to spreading the popularity of the sport across the globe. The great clown film-maker Jacques Tati takes the seaside resort as a microcosm of French society in a gently mocking comedy. It is also the first appearance of his most famous character: M Hulot, a pipe-smoking bachelor with a penchant for getting into choreographed scrapes. It is not just the young ’uns who have summer romances. Willy Russell’s comic play, directed for the screen by Lewis Gilbert, sees middle-aged Liverpool housewife Shirley (the effervescent Pauline Collins) escape her egg-and-chips life for a trip to Greece and a clear-eyed dalliance with Tom Conti’s tavern owner. Not all foreign vacations turn out for the best; some attempts at cultural engagement end in violent death. Ari Aster’s brilliant horror, which uses the extensive daylight and bright colours of a Swedish high summer to chilling effect, has Florence Pugh and her fellow Americans attending a rural pagan festival, only to realise their involvement is central to its bloody success. Wes Anderson brings his fastidious quirkiness to bear on the subject of young love in this delightful comedy set on a New England island over one summer. Jared Gilman’s 12-year-old Khaki Scout Sam falls for local girl Suzy (Kara Hayward) while camping in her area. They arrange to run away together, bringing the wrath of the adults down on them. “Summer dreams, ripped at the seams.” In Ingmar Bergman’s influential drama, the passion engendered by love in the sun can’t last. Bored adolescents Monika (Harriet Andersson) and Harry (Lars Ekborg) spend carefree days and nights on idyllic islands near Stockholm, but reality bites when they return to the city to discover she’s pregnant."
"Jimmy Kimmel ripped a rambling message posted by Donald Trump on his website ahead of the holiday weekend on Thursday evening. “I’m sorry to say the gas prices that you will be confronted with are far higher than they were just a short number of months ago,” the statement read, referring to the season-high number of travelers on Memorial Day weekend. The former president also ranted, without facts, about America’s energy production – “Wasn’t it great to be energy independent, but we are energy independent no more. Shame, shame, shame” – and admonished Americans to “remember as you’re watching the meter tick, and your dollars pile up, how great of a job Donald Trump did as president.” “He’s just a crazy old man shouting at pigeons now,” Kimmel joked. “He seems to have forgotten that the reason gas prices were low was because we had no place to go, we had nowhere to drive. There was a terrible virus killing our grandparents – ‘When I was president, we spent money on porn stars, not gasoline!’” With spikes in the number of weekend travelers for the holiday, the TSA has warned to expect long lines at the airport. It had been so long since mass travel, Kimmel said, that he was even excited for security checks. “When that wand touches my inner thigh,” he said, “I’m going to look that agent right in the eye and say, ‘I missed you too, big guy, I really did.’” “Biden has been president for four months, which means it’s time to start talking about the 2024 presidential election,” Stephen Colbert half-joked on Thursday evening. The frontrunner for the GOP, so much as there is one, remains the former president, who reportedly intends to run again “so long as he still has a good bill of health”, according to Politico. “What? That’s crazy!” said Colbert. “In 2024, he’ll be 78 years old, which is … exactly how old Joe Biden is right now.” But according to Politico, Republicans officials are hoping to replicate Trump’s appeal in a candidate “without the baggage of two impeachments, a Capitol riot he stoked, groundless challenges to his election loss” and the big lie of voter fraud. “But those are all his secret ingredients,” said Colbert. “That’s like taking away the Colonel’s 11 herbs and spices – with both guys, all you’d have left is a chicken-loving old man who reminds you of the Confederacy.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers discussed the unhinged election audit scam still under way in Arizona, where a state-appointed commission of conspiracy theorists have blasted 2020 ballots with UV light, as part of the beyond rabbit-hole theory that Trump watermarked the ballots. “Ah yes, Donald Trump, master forger,” Meyers deadpanned. I don’t think he’s capable of that level of subtlety. His golf pencil is probably a Sharpie. I guarantee you, Trump has no idea how to watermark.” “And on top of that, the UV light could actually damage the ballots – you know, in the name of election integrity,” Meyers continued. “What other genius ideas do they have? Only the real ballots will float so let’s throw them in the river, if they sink it’s fraud? “I mean, what’s next? They feed the ballots to a bunch of chickens and then incinerate the chickens?” Meyers added, referencing an another actual audit conspiracy theory. “Wow, I’m getting good at this. Because for real, there are allegations, which I honestly don’t fully understand, that some of the ballots were, I guess, eaten by chickens and then incinerated? “This audit is crazier than one of those viral cooking videos where someone grinds up a hamburger and turns it into a milkshake,” Meyers said. “And it will not surprise you to learn that the people who commissioned this audit are, you know, lunatics. And I’m not just talking about fringe weirdos, like Lindell. I mean the president of the Arizona state senate, who was tracked down by CNN this week and gave an absolutely bonkers interview” defending the audit. Karen Fann also tore into the CNN reporter for not accepting the Trump propaganda network One America News (OAN) as a credible news source. “Lady, OAN doesn’t even think OAN is a credible news source,” Meyers joked. “Their slogan is ‘OK, hear me out …’”"
"A Christian community on a tiny Hebridean island which for centuries has attracted pilgrims from all over the world will reopen on Monday after a mammoth campaign raised £3.75m to save it from closure. The Iona community, centred on a Benedictine abbey in whose grounds John Smith, the late Labour leader, is buried, has spent the past three years making its buildings fit for the 21st century. The upgrade includes the installation of a renewable energy system and connection to superfast broadband. Princess Anne, patron of the appeal, will visit the island for a blessing ceremony, and thousands of people are expected to join in online celebrations of the successful appeal for the work.  In 2016, the community warned that without significant action its facilities would be unfit for purpose within a few years, which would put its presence on Iona “in serious jeopardy”. The initial estimated cost of the work was £2.1m, but the final costs were significantly higher. Raising the money had been a “daunting prospect”, said Christine Jones, the coordinator of the appeal. “We had some large donations but most of it came from individuals and church communities.” About 2,500 people from 22 countries contributed, raising money from bake sales and sponsored walks. The new energy system will pump hot water from underground to the historic abbey, village hall, schools, homes and businesses on the island. Residential accommodation has been made accessible to wheelchair users, the refectory renovated, a new kitchen and scullery installed, and complete rewiring undertaken. “We’ve tried to be as green as possible, which is really hard in a Benedictine monastery,” said Ruth Harvey, the community’s leader. The work was complicated by the abbey’s listing as a building of significant historical interest and its location on a remote island off the west coast of Scotland. Iona is known as the cradle of Christianity in Scotland. In 563, the Irish monk Saint Columba established a monastic settlement on the island. This week the group will also celebrate the 1,500th anniversary of Saint Columba’s birth. In the middle ages it became the site of a Benedictine abbey, and in 1938, the Iona community was founded by George MacLeod. He took unemployed skilled craftsmen and young trainee clergy from Glasgow to Iona to rebuild the monastic quarters of the ruined medieval abbey. Visitors to the community take part in daily chores, and join in worship and other activities. “This is not a hotel or a conference centre,” said Harvey. “People come for reflection and inspiration, and to explore issues of importance – the environment, poverty, migration, equality – in the context of a Christian community and in a beautiful, rugged landscape.” The community is open to all – “we don’t just cater for signed-up Christians”, said Harvey. Visitors pay to stay with the community, with subsidies available for people on low incomes. The journey from Glasgow can take up to six hours: “Train, boat, bus, boat, walk,” said Harvey. In the year after Smith’s burial in the abbey cemetery following his sudden death from a heart attack in 1994, thousands of people visited his grave. Locals said the site was being “desecrated” with plots surrounding Smith’s tomb trampled and gravestones damaged. Iona, one and a half miles wide and three miles long, has a permanent population of about 120, and 130,000 visitors each year. The community particularly hopes to host people who have been adversely affected by the Covid pandemic in the coming months, said Harvey."
"Actor Omari Douglas was born in Wolverhampton in 1994 and trained at the Arts Educational Schools in London, graduating in 2015. Earlier this year he made his TV debut playing Roscoe Babatunde in It’s a Sin, Russell T Davies’s Channel 4 drama about the 80s Aids crisis. His theatre credits include Rush (King’s Head theatre), Jesus Christ Superstar (Regent’s Park Open Air) and Emma Rice’s Old Vic adaptation of Wise Children. On 16 June, Douglas will be in conversation with Davies for a Guardian Live event; next month he appears in Constellations at the Vaudeville Theatre in the West End. Eurovision 2021 playlist My cousin used to get me to watch Eurovision with her when I was little, so I’m keeping the tradition alive. I watched the final with some friends and it was the best ceremony in years. There were a couple of standout songs that I literally cannot stop playing: one is Sugar, the Moldovan entry – which is nuts – from Natalia Gordienko, and Loco Loco, by this Serbian girl group called Hurricane. The aesthetics were absolutely brilliant. Hurricane looked like they could have been on Real Housewives, and they did this incredible dance routine. So I’ve been blasting that out. 1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything (Apple TV+) I came across this music documentary when Lauren Laverne was interviewing [director] Asif Kapadia on her [BBC Radio 6 Music] show. She mentioned the title and I thought: “Oh, I’ve read that book, it’s by David Hepworth.” It’s essentially spotlighting what musicians were doing as artists in order to reflect that time politically, and it’s completely fascinating how those two things ran alongside each other. There’s a brilliant section about Oz magazine and the rise of censorship, and Marc Bolan, and how David Bowie went from being an underground figure to a global superstar. Out for Blood A few weeks ago I listened to this podcast about the musical version of Carrie, which was commissioned for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1988. There was a hoo-ha about it; a lot of puritans were like: “We can’t believe the RSC are putting on a musical version of a Stephen King novel.” It transferred to Broadway and flopped. The podcast gives you lots of funny anecdotes about putting on the show; they speak to the cast and pick the production apart. I’m a musical theatre geek, so it was fascinating to hear it play out. Real Life by Brandon Taylor I read this during lockdown and absolutely loved it. It’s about this post-grad science student in the US, and his life as a millennial queer black man navigating what is a very white space. Brandon Taylor writes fascinating, complex characters: he’s got a really good way of capturing everything that’s going on internally for people, and his attention to detail is amazing. He’s got a new book coming out later this month called Filthy Animals, which I’m looking forward to, and he puts out a really interesting weekly newsletter. His writing is so crisp and I love all his references. Nordic Poetry, London E2 Since we’ve been able to go into shops I went back to this vintage clothing store. It’s really well curated by a cool Swedish woman called Ameli Lindgren – I always ask her where she gets her stuff from and she’s just: “I’m not telling you that.” There’s a lot of pieces from the 70s in there: beautiful Missoni knitwear, Gucci jewellery. A lot of the clothes in my wardrobe are secondhand, and I’m not really interested in labels, but I appreciate the quality of the pieces. I managed to get a suit there for my cousin’s wedding, so it’s pretty good. We Are Lady Parts (Channel 4) I’m a couple of episodes into this. It’s a comedy about an all-female Muslim punk-rock band and Anjana Vasan, who’s an amazing actress, plays a misfit who ends up auditioning for the band. It’s captivating: they’ve been really brave in how they’ve told the story – it catches you off-guard at times. They’ll just throw a musical number in there, or there’ll be a big fantasy sequence. All the actresses are immensely talented because they’re playing all the music themselves and they’re singing. It’s fun and subversive and I’m excited to see where it goes."
"History’s purpose isn’t to comfort us, says David Olusoga, although many in the UK seem to think it is. “History doesn’t exist to make us feel good, special, exceptional or magical. History is just history. It is not there as a place of greater safety.” As a historian and broadcaster, Olusoga has been battling this misconception for almost two decades, as the producer or presenter of TV series including Civilisations, The World’s War, A House Through Time and the Bafta-winning Britain’s Forgotten Slave Owners. His scholarship has been widely recognised: in 2019, he was awarded an OBE and made a professor at the University of Manchester. (He is also on the board of the Scott Trust, which owns Guardian Media Group.) Yet apologists for empire, in particular, like to dismiss him as a “woke historian” in an attempt to politicise his work or flatly deny the realities that he points out. Now he can expect more flak, thanks to the new edition of his book Black and British: A Forgotten History. First published in 2016, and made into a TV series the same year, the book charts black British history from the first meeting between the people of Britain and the people of Africa during the Roman period, to the racism Olusoga encountered during his own childhood, via Britain’s role in the slave trade and the scramble for Africa. It is a story that some of Olusoga’s critics would prefer was forgotten. Hostility to his work has grown since the Brexit vote, shooting up “profoundly since last summer”, he says, speaking over Zoom from his office in Bristol. “It has now got to the point where some of the statements being made are so easily refutable, so verifiably and unquestionably false, that you have to presume that the people writing them know that. And that must lead you to another assumption, which is that they know that this is not true, but they have decided that these national myths are so important to them and their political projects, or their sense of who they are, that they don’t really care about the historical truths behind them. “They have been able to convince people that their own history, being explored by their own historians and being investigated by their own children and grandchildren, is a threat to them.” For Olusoga, 51, this hostility can in part be explained by ignorance. “If you were taught a history that the first black person to put his foot on English soil was stepping off the Windrush in 1948, then this can seem like a conspiracy,” he says. But there is a deeper issue at play. “If you have been told a version of your history and that is part of your identity, it’s very difficult when people like me come along and say: ‘There are these chapters [that you need to know about].’ People feel – wrongly in my view – that their history is being undermined by my history. But my history isn’t a threat to your history. My history is part of your history.” When the book was published in 2016, it ended on a hopeful note. Olusoga was writing just a few years after the London Olympics, in which a tantalising view of Britain emerged – a country at ease with its multiculturalism, nodding with pride to the arrival of the Windrush generation in 1948. Black Londoners dressed up as their ancestors for the opening ceremony, “with long, baggy suits, holding their suitcases”, says Olusoga. “You have to have a real tenure in the country to play your ancestors.” That moment, he says, was profoundly beautiful. But that upbeat note has begun to feel inaccurate – an artefact of a more optimistic time. In the new edition of Black and British, which includes a chapter on the Windrush scandal and last year’s Black Lives Matter protests, Olusoga describes that moment in 2012 as a mirage. The summer afterwards, vans bearing the message “Go home or face arrest” were driven around London as part of Theresa May’s notorious “hostile environment” strategy, aiming to make the UK inhospitable for undocumented migrants. Thousands of people who had lived legally in the UK for decades, often people who had arrived from the Caribbean as children, were suddenly targeted for deportation. In 2020, protesters in more than 260 British towns and cities took part in BLM protests, thought to be the most widespread anti-racist movement since the abolition of the slave trade. A statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was toppled in Bristol; a Guardian analysis suggests about 70 monuments to slavers and colonialists have been removed, or are in the process of being removed, across the UK. But this movement for racial justice has been met with a severe backlash. In January, Robert Jenrick, the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, said he would introduce laws to protect statues from what he called “baying mobs”. The government’s recent review on racial equality concluded controversially that there was no institutional racism in areas including policing, health and education, despite all the evidence to the contrary. “I’m really frightened about the future of this country, and frightened about people using forces of race and racism for electoral reasons and not being cognisant about how difficult it is to control those forces after elections have been counted,” says Olusoga. “I’m really frightened about the extent to which people are able to entirely dehumanise people who they deem to be their enemies in this culture war.” Olusoga was born in Lagos in 1970, to a white British mother and a Nigerian father, moving to his mother’s home town, Gateshead, at an early age. As one of a handful of mixed-race families on the council estate where they lived, they were regularly terrorised by the far right. The violence culminated in a brick being thrown into the family’s home, wrapped in a note demanding they be sent “back”. He was 14. Eventually, the family had to be rehoused. His early experience of education was also distressing. “I experienced racism from teachers in ways that are shocking if I tell them to young people at school now,” says Olusoga. He was dyslexic, but the school refused to get him tested until he did his GCSEs: “It was the easier story to believe that this kid was stupid because all black kids are stupid.” When he finally got his diagnosis and support – thanks in large part to his mother’s fierce determination – Olusoga went to study history at the University of Liverpool, followed by a master’s degree at Leicester. Olusoga was confident about having two identities, despite the prejudice he had encountered. He was proud of being a black Nigerian of Yoruba heritage and was perfectly happy being part of his mother’s white working-class geordie tradition. But he has always had a third identity. “I’m also black British – and that had no history, no recognition. It was presented as impossible – a dualism that couldn’t exist, because whiteness and Britishness were the same thing when I was growing up. So, to discover that there was a history of being black and British, independent from being half white working-class and being half black Nigerian, that was what was critically important to me,” he says. His book does its best to uncover that history, exploring the considerable presence of black people in Britain in the age of slavery, as well as the part played by black Britons in both world wars. He says that some of the aggression shown towards black historians who write honestly about Britain’s past comes from people who think “this history is important because it gives black people the right to be here”. They hold on to the belief that the UK was a “white country” until the past few decades and refuse to accept evidence that shows the presence of black people goes back centuries. But this is to fundamentally misunderstand what drives him and also why this history is important for black people. “I don’t feel challenged in my right to be proud to be British,” he says. “I’m perfectly comfortable in my identity. I’ve looked at this history because it’s just exciting to be part of a long story. This comes out of wanting to enrich life, not seeking some sort of needy validation of who I am.” He found it refreshing to see the UK’s history of empire and colonialism acknowledged in last summer’s anti-racist placards, with one popular slogan stating “The UK is not innocent”. “A generation has emerged that doesn’t need history to perform that role of comfort that its parents and grandparents did,” he says. As for black people’s experiences in Britain, he says, there is a “hysterical” level of anger if you point out that many have lived in some form of slavery or unfreedom. Recently, historians have uncovered notices of runaway enslaved people or advertisements for their sale. This adds to the evidence that thousands of black people were brought to Britain, enslaved as well as free. “It brings slavery to Britain and therefore undermines the idea that it doesn’t really matter because it happened ‘over there’,” says Olusoga. “It short-circuits an idea of British exceptionalism. And there are a lot of people for whom that idea of exceptionalism is a part of how they see themselves. I’m really sorry that the stuff I do and that other people do is a challenge to that, but my job is to be a historian. It’s not to make people feel good.” Olusoga is often accused of pursuing a political agenda. He is asked, for instance, why he doesn’t speak about the Barbary slave trade of the 16th to 18th centuries, in which Europeans were captured and traded by north African pirates. He has a simple response: that he has been trying to get a programme made about it for his entire career and it is finally happening. He gives another example: “I have been accused literally hundreds of times of ignoring the slavery suppression squadron that the Royal Navy created after 1807.” Its task was to suppress the Atlantic slave trade by patrolling the coast of west Africa. “I think the chapter in Black and British about that is 30,000 words, which is as long as some books.” What his more extreme critics fail to understand, he adds, is that he is loyal to history and not a political agent. He remains committed to one goal: to uncover the stories of those who have long been deemed unimportant. When he wrote his first book on the 1904-08 Namibian genocide, he went to mass graves where he saw bones sticking out of the ground. “We promised the victims of that genocide that we would be their voice, we would fight for them and we would tell their story – and we use every skill we have to do that. “I care deeply about people who were mistreated in the past. I care about the names on slave ledgers, I care about the bones of people in Africa, in mass graves in the first world war and in riverbeds in Namibia. I care about them. I think about them when I read the letters, when I look at their photographs and their faces. No one gave a damn about them. That’s my job – to care about them. And I will be ruthless in fighting for them.” An updated edition of Black and British: A Forgotten History, with a new chapter, is published on 10 June (Picador, £12.99).

"Strictly’s supervillain with a soft centre: Revel Horwood’s putdowns are as crucial to the annual BBC dance show as fake tan and flammable leotards. “It was like watching a stork who’s been struck by lightning,” he said of Jeremy Vine’s jive. But his insults are invariably rounded off with an affectionate “darling”, thus ensuring that no one actually punches him. The former protege of Michel Roux Jr can deflate a souffle at 50 paces. The Samoa-born, New Zealand-raised Galetti strikes fear into cooks everywhere, her expressions running the gamut from resignation to revulsion, while her icy poise stands in glorious contrast to the barking of presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode. Few imagined that national treasure Mary Berry could be replaced on Bake Off without sending the viewing figures off a cliff. But they didn’t bargain for Prue Leith. Big specs and even bigger necklaces are Leith’s calling cards, along with the odd social media cock-up (she once tweeted the show’s winner before the final had aired). Few judges can compare to La Minaj on American Idol 12, where she routinely addressed contestants as “little ladybug”, wowed with her outfits and had spectacular beefs with fellow judge Mariah Carey. Minaj’s feedback also came loaded with zingers. “I wanna skin you and wear you,” she told one would-be pop star. When the occasional Pussycat Doll first appeared on The X Factor in 2010, her feedback – “Schamazing”; “You’re just the bomb-dot-com” – instantly entered the TV talent show lexicon. We also have her to thank for saving Rylan, who repaid the favour by showering her in snot and tears. Garland is a cosmetics supremo in statement specs who has worked with Lady Gaga and the Queen, and comes with a Miranda-from-The-Devil-Wears-Prada vibe. In Glow Up’s version of Bake Off’s Hollywood handshake, she greets makeup triumphs with a satisfied exclamation of “ding dong!”. Former lawyer, businesswoman and “eyes and ears” of Sir Alan Sugar, Mountford had a benign Miss Marple-ish air that belied her lethal boardroom assessments. During her five-year stint, there was no more fearsome interrogator at the interview stage, her damning phrases instantly reducing interviewees to clammy wrecks. The Incredibles’ Edna E Mode brought to life, Esme Young is a costume designer to the stars, Central St Martins tutor and a quietly merciless judge on Sewing Bee, on which she once appeared wearing hand-sanitiser bottles as a necklace. Small, fierce and all about precision stitching, Young’s seams are as sharp as her bob. A legend of the 1980s New York ballroom scene – she reckons Madonna stole her look – Visage is a reality TV fixture, having appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, The X Factor and Celebrity Big Brother. But it’s on Drag Race that she has truly sparkled, not least when judging Night of 1,000 Michelle Visages, which saw her faced with a parade of drag queens dressed as her. Keith loves pots. Keith also loves people who make pots; so much so that he ugly-cries whenever they make a nice one. A master potter himself, Keith cries so much on The Great Pottery Throw Down that pots need to be fashioned to catch his tears. Keith is deeply invested in his role as pottery purveyor and so, as a result, are we."
"Stephen Colbert kicked off Thursday’s Late Show with news that a New York appellate court suspended the law license of infamous Trump acolyte Rudy Giuliani for peddling “demonstrably false and misleading statements to the courts, lawmakers and the public at large in his capacity as lawyer for Donald J Trump”. “This is a dramatic fall from grace,” said Colbert. “In the city he was famously the mayor of, Rudy Giuliani can no longer practice law. And if the last year has proven anything, it’s that when it comes to law, Rudy needs a lot of practice.” “Giuliani was America’s mayor!” he continued. “Before that, he was the crusading federal prosecutor who busted up La Cosa Nostra. Now he’s lost his career. How’s he going to eat? And, more likely, drink? “Well, if he needs cash, he can always sell the fracking rights to his skull,” Colbert joked over an infamous photo of hair dye running down Giuliani’s temples as he baselessly disputed the validity of the 2020 election. Later, Colbert touched on the shocking testimony by pop star Britney Spears at a court hearing on Wednesday. In an emotional 24-plus minute speech, Spears called for an end to the “abusive” conservatorship that has governed her life since 2008, claiming that she had been intimidated and punished by her father and management team, who “should be in jail”. “That’s right, Britney told the judge, ‘they’re not that innocent,’” sang Colbert. “Here’s how messed up this situation is,” Colbert continued: because Spears doesn’t have control over her own money, she has to pay for both legal teams, including the lawyers arguing against her wishes in court. “That is insane!” Colbert exclaimed. “Everyone in her life is profiting from keeping her in this situation. “Britney had a clear request for the judge: ‘I just want my life back. And it’s been 13 years. And it’s enough.’” “It’s enough, and I have something to say to the court,” Colbert said, whipping out a stack of Spears’s famous singles: “Your honor, this conservatorship over Britney Spears is Toxic. The fact that this is legal is Criminal. Everytime I think of the Circus around her, I Scream and Shout, because this is Crazy. Britney is saying I Wanna Go because all these people want a Piece of Me, but the response is just Gimme More. Britney, Don’t Cry, you are Stronger than these Womanizers and we are Lucky to have you. Jamie Spears, your daughter deserves to be in control of her own Work, Bitch. And anyone who doesn’t think so is Crazy. Oh, I already used that one? Well, Oops … I Did It Again.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers also riffed on New York’s suspension of Giuliani’s law license. “I mean, I’m just shocked to find out Rudy had a law license. I bet Rudy was too,” he quipped. “So Rudy can’t practice law in New York any more – not that he really was before,” he continued. “I mean, I imagine the only reason to procure Rudy’s legal services would be to have a lawyer who’s guiltier than you are. “Republicans have made it clear, over and over, that they consider Trump the leader of their party,” Meyers later added, “although there have been some suspiciously self-serving leaks to the media about two Trump family members in particular who are supposedly distancing themselves from the former president.” That would be Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, former senior adviser Jared Kushner, who are reportedly tiring of the former president’s constant, false grievances about a stolen election. “One thing I believe deeply in my heart is that Jared and Ivanka would break from Donald Trump after he lost the most powerful job in the world,” Meyers said, imitating Ivanka – “you’re my father, and I will stand by you no matter what. Hold on real quick – they’re just about to call Pennsylvania, OK goodbye forever, lose my number.” “You know how we’ve been saying how pleasantly boring it is has been with President Biden in the White House because he doesn’t do anything weird? Well, today he did something weird,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night. referring to two moments during a press conference in which the president whispered into the microphone. ‘That’s the sound Jill Biden hears just before he starts chewing on her hair. Too much?” Kimmel asked. As for Giuliani’s suspended license, the former Trump lawyer “could soon be disbarred, or behind bars, or perhaps both. But Recount Dracula did get a show of support today from the former president, who put out a forceful statement screaming about justice” as well as a bizarre video of support from his son Andrew, filmed in a parking lot and framed so that only his neck and head appears on camera. “Is he like three feet tall?” Kimmel deadpanned. “The guy wants to be governor and he doesn’t have a single friend to hold the iPhone for him. Only the best people.”"
"Artists recruited to transform one of the UK’s leading Chinese arts centres have called for support to be withdrawn from the organisation, claiming it has an “entrenched acceptance of racist attitudes”. Seven artists of Chinese heritage have called for the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art (CFCCA) in Manchester to be defunded because of a “current and [historical] culture of institutional racism”. In September the CFCCA appointed the seven artists to a working group (AWG) in an effort to address issues surrounding equality and inclusion. The appointments were part of the charity’s “revisioning” project, launched after it came under criticism from staff and contractors over a lack of staff representation, with the artist JJ Chan withdrawing from an exhibition at the gallery last year citing the dominance of white people at the organisation. Just months after their appointments the project was paused in January, before being completely halted, when the artists raised issues surrounding institutional racism with the gallery. Jack Tan, an artist from Dumfries and Galloway who was part of the working group, said the main issue centred on a renowned centre for Chinese contemporary art being run “entirely by white people.” “Therefore it is the white gaze and the white gatekeeping of what is British Chinese culture in the UK,” he said. “We were meant to be equal partners in reforming and revisioning the organisation but what we experienced was institutional racism through cancelling and avoidance and not being upfront about historic and very recent allegations of racist bullying by staff.” A subsequent report on the issues at the CFCCA, published by the artists, says: “It has become clear to us that we are dealing with an organisation that dysfunctionally avoids, dodges and spins issues that need to be tackled honestly, directly and quickly.” The report claims there is an “entrenched acceptance of racist attitudes” and also accuses a board member of saying “there were no qualified Chinese or curators/employees of colour in the job market”. It says “exposure to this and other racially insensitive comments, behaviours or attitudes throughout this process caused us harm”. The group, which is calling for senior staff and trustees to stand down, urged Arts Council England (ACE) to open an investigation into the CFCCA, and to stop funding “an institutionally racist and dysfunctional organisation and to repurpose their investment into the practices of east and south-east Asian artists”. After publishing its report, the artists started a petition, which has so far garnered more than 700 signatures. Artist Gayle Chong Kwan said the CFCCA was not operating in line with its charitable objectives. “I would say that there has been an erosion of trust in CFCCA as a charity over the years and a complete loss of faith in the last 18 months,” she said. She added: “In terms of governance CFCCA should have seen this coming but have grown complacent about meeting their legal, ethical and care responsibilities for the changing needs of the people and artists they serve, particularly in the light of current Covid anti-Chinese hate and violence.” On its website, the CFCCA has posted a number of statements about the revisioning project, stating that it had been paused “to recruit a new chair of trustees as this is essential to the project’s successful delivery”. In the latest statement, after the publication of the AWG’s report, the charity acknowledged that individuals had been “hurt” and said it was “listening intently” to criticisms and are “fully committed” to working towards being an actively anti-racist and pro-equality organisation. “We are reviewing and improving CFCCA’s recruitment procedures and are investigating alternative models of leadership, to address representation within the team at a senior level,” it added. Separately, the charity told Civil Society that it had not yet filed a serious incident report with the Charity Commission, but would be in touch with the regulator “in due course”. Meanwhile, Arts Council England (ACE), the CFCCA’s main funder, said although it was not responsible for the governance of the organisations it funds it took allegations of racism seriously and had urgently contacted the charity. “We do have policies and agreements in place to monitor our funded organisations and to hold them to account,” the spokesperson added. ACE confirmed it had met some of the artists in the working group and was actively in conversation with the CFCCA and the artists. This month the Barbican was described as “institutionally racist” by its staff, who compiled a dossier of alleged incidents in a book that they say shows the cultural organisation has failed to live up to anti-racism commitments it made a year ago."
"Stephen Colbert discussed the failure of the Biden administration landmark voting rights bill to pass a procedural vote on Tuesday, as the For the People Act was left stranded in a 50-50 stalemate along party lines. “Republicans instead supported the ‘For Some of the People – We Can’t Say It Out Loud But You Know Which Ones We Mean Act,’” Colbert joked. “Republicans had a lot of stupid explanations for blocking the bill,” he added. “But the creme de la dumb” came from Mitch McConnell, who said before the vote “the Senate is only an obstacle when the policy is flawed … today the Senate is going to fulfill its founding purpose.” “Yes, the Senate’s founding purpose: to do nothing,” Colbert retorted. In other news, Donald Trump taunted conspiracy-addled supporters who believe he’ll be reinstated as president this August with a chipper, and fraudulent, “2024 or before!” in a statement to conservative outlet RSB News. “Nah,” Colbert said to boos from the audience. “I think you’re 2021 and done.” Trump’s inner circle seems to be shrinking, as CNN reported that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had been distancing themselves from the former president and his “constant complaints”. “That complaint?” Colbert said, breaking out his Trump impression – “why does he get to date my daughter, doesn’t seem fair. We’re both family.” The feeling appears to be mutual, as CNN also reported there was jealousy from the former president over Kushner’s seven-figure book deal. “Early reports are Jared’s book is going to be a lot like Jared – glossy and no spine,” Colbert quipped. “We’re constantly reminded, even five months after he left office, that Trump’s response to the pandemic was somehow much worse and much crazier than we even knew at the time,” said Seth Meyers on Wednesday’s Late Night. “Every day we keep hearing new details about his time in office thanks to what seems like a never-ending parade of tell-all books scheduled for publication, each filled with more damning new details about just how much of a sociopath he was.” Meyers referred specifically to the forthcoming Nightmare Scenario: Inside the Trump Administration’s Response to the Pandemic That Changed History, by Yasmeen Abutaleb and Damian Paletta, two reporters at the Washington Post, which revealed that early in the pandemic, Trump suggested sending infected Americans stuck on cruise ships to Guantánamo Bay. “Don’t we have an island that we own?” he asked the White House Situation Room in February 2020. “What about Guantánamo?” “Only Trump would refer to Guantánamo Bay as an island that we own,” Meyers said. “It’s such a reminder that he will always first and foremost be a real estate guy. “It would’ve been hilarious watching Trump try to rebrand Guantánamo as a fun place for people to spend a week,” he added with his own Trump impression: “Welcome to Guantán-a-lago Spa & Resort, make sure you check out the bay, I’m sure it is full of pigs!” “Also, was there like a fantasy football draft, but for the stories each staffer got to tell for their books?” Meyers continued, mocking a staffer – “I can’t decide between the time he wanted to send cruise ship passengers to Gitmo, or the time he asked if he could legally send Seal Team 6 to rough up Lorne Michaels.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel lambasted “Top Karen in Congress” Marjorie Taylor Greene and her so-called “Fire Fauci” Act. The conspiracy-laced measure would not actually fire Dr Fauci, but rather reduce his salary to zero. “Isn’t it amazing she thinks she deserves the $100k we pay her a year and he doesn’t?” Kimmel marveled. “Klan mom accuses Dr Fauci of failing to provide people with accurate information about the Covid-19 pandemic,” he explained. “This is from the woman who believes Hillary Clinton eats baby meat and pepperoni on her pizzas. “Meanwhile, Marjorie’s personal lord and savior Donald Trump is – I don’t know what’s going on,” Kimmel continued. “Trump’s inner circle is almost as small as his hands right now. Even Jared and Ivanka are said to be distancing themselves on Presi-daddy. “Trump is reportedly so distant from Ivanka he’s started calling her Eric, which is really sad,” he joked."
"Australia’s first fringe festival for 2021 has become mired in controversy over a clause in performer and promoter contracts to deter criticism of the event’s sponsors. Perth’s Fringe World, which opens on 15 January, attracted criticism and protests earlier this year over its longstanding sponsorship by fossil fuel giant Woodside. In a bid to head off disruption of next month’s event, the organisers – not-for-profit company Artrage – have included in the festival’s main contract the stipulation that “the presenter and the venue operator must use its best endeavours to not do any act or omit to do any act that would prejudice any of Fringe World’s sponsorship arrangements”. Included in Fringe World’s artists’ registration pack, the contract also states: “If you have an objection to a Fringe World sponsor, we ask that you consider whether participation in the festival is the right platform for your presentation.” Performers who spoke to Guardian Australia said the clause effectively amounted to a gag order, curtailing comment on anything from climate change to local politics. Comedian Tom Ballard told the Guardian the clause was “disappointing and concerning”. “It’s a pretty obvious contravention of a commitment to freedom of expression,” he said. Woodside, Australia’s largest gas and oil exploration and production company, is listed as the event’s principal partner and has naming rights for the festival’s central entertainment hub, the Pleasure Garden. Other partners include City of Perth and Channel 7, meaning any jibes about Perth’s controversial new mayor, Channel 7 presenter Basil Zempilas, could also land participants in hot water. Ballard performed in the Woodside Pleasure Garden in last year’s Fringe World and tackled the issue of climate change in his material, he said. “If we don’t have artistic freedom, the chance to say what we want in those shows because of the commercial arrangements surrounding the festival, then I think we’re in really dicey territory, particularly now we’re really getting towards the crunch time with the climate crisis.” Alternative cabaret artist and DJ Tomás Ford, who will be performing at the Woodside Pleasure Garden in January, said the clause was a “big overstep” and huge concern among local artists. “Putting this kind of attempt of a non-disparagement clause in front of artists, it’s as though they’re employing artists and that’s actually not the function of a fringe festival at all,” he said. “The function of a fringe festival is to create a context and facilitate a marketplace for independent producers to sell their works to an audience … the sponsorships are theirs, not ours as independent producers.” The festival’s CEO, Sharon Burgess, said Artrage was not seeking to control performers or curtail the content of any performance. “We just ask people, that if you hate what we do, well, [participation] is entirely optional,” she said. A Woodside spokesperson said the company had played no role in the terms and conditions of Fringe World’s contracts. “We sponsor Fringe World, we have no influence over content,” she said. “It’s entirely up to Fringe how they manage their content, and we provide sponsorship. That’s the end of it.” Promoter Chris Dodd, who last year brought three artists from the UK to the festival, including comedian and political activist Kate Smurthwaite, said participants were concerned over what action the organisers might take for any breach of contract involving the event’s sponsors. “Do you risk being banned from future fringes?” he said. “This is where it gets so vague and you don’t know what they’re going to do, you don’t know whether they might take money away from you, you don’t know whether you might get sued. Who knows.” One of the environmental activists who has been lobbying Artrage to drop Woodside as a major sponsor received a cease and desist letter last December, which the Guardian has seen, over a number of Facebook posts criticising the sponsorship deal. The Perth legal firm K&L Gates, which has also acted for Woodside in the past including in a 2014 high court challenge, said in the letter it was acting on behalf of Artrage. Burgess told the Guardian nobody was going to get sued. “But we do say, read our policy and decide if this is the platform for you,” she said. “We respect the right for peaceful protests … we respect the voices that artists have, in fact we encourage them, so it wasn’t meant to be a gagging order or any kind.” Burgess would not disclose how much the Woodside partnership was worth to Fringe World, saying only that it made up about 20% of the event’s sponsorship income. According to Artrage Inc’s annual report, sponsorship revenue for 2020 was more than $4m, including $973,331 in cash. Ballard said there was increasing recognition among cultural organisations that accepting sponsorship from fossil fuel companies would invariably attract criticism. “This is clearly an arrangement that’s designed to provide Woodside with a social licence to keep doing what they’re doing, and to kind of art-wash them a little bit and distract us from their record on climate and emissions,” he said. Ford said the issue of “arts-washing” by mining companies in Western Australia was of concern to local artists. “You see big fossil fuel sponsorships around the country but here it’s harder to argue with because the industry is so intertwined in the city,” he said. “It’s just a very accepted mode of sponsorship in this state.”"
"It’s a development that its most famous occupant might have predicted, even if it would have him spinning in his well-visited grave. North London’s Highgate cemetery, final resting place of Karl Marx, is to undergo a makeover to enhance its visitor experience. In addition to a spot of landscaping, it will have an exhibition space, a separate gift shop and possibly a cafe. Home to the remains of 170,000 people, Highgate, which opened in 1839, is the latest cemetery seeking to capitalise on the public’s growing interest in death. Brompton cemetery in south London has recently been given a makeover which saw buildings restored and a lodge turned into a visitor centre with the help of a £4.5m grant from the National Lottery Community Fund. And Brookwood cemetery in Surrey, which has been operating since 1854 when London’s cemeteries became overcrowded following a cholera epidemic, is now opening a museum of death. “People used to think that visiting cemeteries was a bit weird, a bit ghoulish, a bit morbid,” said Dr Ian Dungavell, head of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust which maintains the cemetery with no public funding. “Now they are realising that cemeteries are part of our historic cultural environment.” This would perhaps not be a surprise to Marx, who observed in the Communist Manifesto: “In bourgeois society... the past dominates the present.” But Dungavell suggested it was actually a vogue for family history, popularised by online genealogy sites, and a more open attitude to discussing death, that had seen death tourism come back into fashion. “There’s a sort of circularity about these discussions. When Highgate opened, cemetery tourism was a big thing, not just in London. If you went to Paris in the 1830s, one of the top places to go was Père Lachaise – it was a must-see.” Highgate, which today draws 100,000 paying visitors a year, up from 63,000 seven years ago, opened before London had public parks, offering a day out for city dwellers. At the time, it took out advertisements boasting of its unrivalled views across the capital and the splendour of its Egyptian architecture. But as cemeteries fell out of fashion with more people opting for cremation, Highgate, once used as a horror location by Hammer films, fell into benign neglect and nature attempted to take back the gravestones. “There is an aesthetic attraction,” Dungavell acknowledged. “Monuments are tumbling down and ivy is growing over them. It can be quite moving. There is sense that nature has it in for all of us – it’s going to win. That’s quite poignant, and people really appreciate that. But romantic decay is still decay, and as the trees get bigger the potential for damage becomes much greater.” Aware of the sensitivities involved, the trust is to run one competition to challenge designers and architects to come up with a new landscape masterplan and another to improve facilities which will include new toilets, a separate shop and a cafe. Of the latter competition, Dungavell said the winner would need to demonstrate “a very light touch”, one that respected the cemetery’s unique atmosphere. “You don’t want to feel that a visitor centre that could be found at any other visitor attraction has just been dropped in here.” Jane Findlay, president of the Landscape Institute, which is working with Highgate on the competitions, acknowledged that there would be concerns. “There has been a fear that any change could unintentionally destroy what people find special about the place, and so up until now a minimal intervention approach has been favoured,” Findlay said. “But it has come to a tipping point where that is no longer sustainable. Some monuments are under threat from long-term decay and maturing self-seeded trees, and many trees are afflicted by pests and diseases brought about by climate change. More extreme weather is eroding gravel paths and overwhelming the historic drainage systems.” In 2019, following a fungal attack, the cemetery lost a 250-year-old cedar tree which was at the heart of its Circle of Lebanon series of tombs. Findlay said that many other cemeteries were also feeling the effects of the climate emergency. Last year the National Memorial Arboretum in south Staffordshire suffered some of the worst flooding in its history followed by one of the driest springs on record, an event that placed huge stresses on its plants and trees. But, ultimately, Findlay suggested that cemeteries could play a part in countering global heating. “The importance of cemeteries as urban green spaces is often overlooked. Relatively untouched by surrounding urban development, they often act as green oases. They offer special places for quiet, reflection and contemplation. And, like other green spaces, they have an important role in mitigating the effects of climate change, and provide a range of important natural habitats for many different – and often rare – plant life and animals.”"
"The Australian actor Yael Stone has vowed to give up her green card, which allows her to work in the United States, as a “personal sacrifice” aimed at reducing carbon emissions in what she called the “climate war”. In a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday and Instagram on Sunday, the actor and star of Netflix’s Orange is the New Black said she came to the decision to give up her green card “after a long, considered process”. “We’ve come to understand that it’s unethical for us to set up a life in two countries, knowing what we know,” Stone said in the video, calling such frequent travelling “environmentally unjust”. “The carbon emissions alone from that flying – it’s unethical. It’s not right. So I will be going through the process of giving up my green card, and saying goodbye to a life in America. I’m going to be here in Australia doing the the work I can to make a difference here. Because the time is now.” In an earlier video posted to Instagram on Sunday, Stone expressed horror at the political response to Australia’s ongoing and months-long bushfire crisis. “I’m sitting in a dark room wondering what the hell is happening. Our country is on fire … and our prime minister has done absolutely nothing. Cold, calculated nothing. We don’t have leaders, we have cowards,” she said. The actor, who recently starred in Sydney Theatre Company’s production of The Beauty Queen of Leenane, also implored others to act. “The leaders we have are the people around us. And that’s what we have to become. “We have to step up because this is war. This is a climate war. And for the first time our enemy is not wearing a uniform that we’ll be able to recognise. Our enemy is our own behaviour.” Stone said giving up her green card was a way that she could put “skin in the game”. “This is war, and we’ve only got 10 years. So let’s make these sacrifices. Let’s make these changes. Let’s put some skin in the game and say yeah, I care, and this is what I’m going to do about it. This is just the beginning from me,” she said. “It’s corporate wide, it’s government wide, it’s systematic changes that must happen, and they must happen yesterday. It’s time to act.”"
"Dozens of activists have coated themselves in plaster and are trying to occupy the British Museum overnight in a bid to pressure the institution to cut ties with oil corporation BP. About 60 protesters were taking part in the defiant act of impromptu sculpture making as the museum in London attempted to close its doors at 5pm on Saturday. The action, entitled Monument, is the first of its kind to be conducted by the theatrical protest group BP or not BP? “We are imagining a world in which the British Museum has stopped celebrating those causing the climate crisis and is instead allying itself with those who have, currently are, and will be putting their bodies on the line in the fight for climate justice,” said a plaque describing the protest. The civil disobedience campaign began on Friday night when protesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors smuggled a 13-foot Trojan horse into the museum’s foyer. The protest was in response to an exhibition, Troy: Myth and Reality, which is described as “supported by BP”. Two guards slept inside its belly overnight, despite a downpour at around 4am, to prevent it being removed. The group estimated that as many as 1,500 supporters took part in the action on Saturday. Protesters occupied 11 of the museum’s rooms, which became host to spoken word performances, singalongs and talks by campaigners from West Papua and Senegal. Origami swans were scattered throughout the museum adorned with messages including: “Choose sponsors who care about our future”. Protesters finished the day by tearing apart paper versions of BP’s logo near the museum’s main entrance. “We feel that the museum’s attitudes towards climate change and colonialism are not what they should be in the 21st century,” said the group’s Jess Worth. Suzanne Savage, from Malvern, Worcestershire, was among a gathering of fee-paying British Museum members who unfurled a banner emblazoned with the words “BP must fall”. She said: “I have been a longstanding member of the British Museum. I very much support the art but we do not want this noble institution’s reputation being sullied by sponsorship from a dirty oil company, which is one of the biggest polluters in the world.” Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, said: “The museum is a public space where people can come to debate and we respect other people’s right to express their views. “We share the concerns for the challenges that we all face together as a result of climate change. We address these issues in an innovative way through significant exhibitions and public programming. “The British Museum offers for millions of people an extraordinary opportunity to engage with the cultures and histories of humankind. Without external support and sponsorship this would not be possible. “Removing this opportunity from the public is not a contribution to solving the climate crisis.” The protest is the latest move in activists’ campaign to end fossil fuel sponsorship of the UK’s leading cultural venues. In October, the Royal Shakespeare Company ditched its sponsorship deal with BP, after a campaign from artists, environmentalists and members of the public."
"The 1995 BBC adaptation of Persuasion never really had its time in the sun. Overshadowed by another Jane Austen production that debuted the same year (and with no wet shirts), the adaptation won a few awards before fading into obscurity. I might have missed it entirely were it not for the Jane Austen fandom. More enthusiastic than Star Wars and Marvel fans combined, their reaction to the casting of Dakota Johnson in the upcoming Netflix adaptation, set to air in 2022, put the 1995 film on my radar, and I set about tracking it down. I’m very glad I did. Persuasion was Austen’s last finished novel, written when the society she so eloquently satirised was beginning to significantly change. The film opens with a navy admiral returning triumphant from the war; his arrival is juxtaposed against an angry mob gathering around the estate of a pompous, spendthrift baronet. It’s clear which group is on the up, and the baronet is forced to rent his property to the admiral to pay his debts. Of course, this brings complications of the heart for Anne Elliot (Amanda Root), the baronet’s daughter. Not only is she about to lose her home, the new tenants are related to the man whose proposal she was persuaded to reject at age 19. Now 27 and considered a bit of an old maid, Anne isn’t relocating to fashionable Bath with the relatives. Instead, she’s left to do the end-of-lease clean on the family estate, before being packed off in a pig cart to manage her hypochondriac sister. Regrets? Anne has a few. Unlike Elizabeth Bennet, arguably the public’s favourite Austen heroine, Anne is not playful or witty. Instead, she’s quiet, sensible, full of remorse at not having the courage of her convictions years ago, and surrounded by a bunch of oxygen thieves. Some characters are oblivious to how they treat her, others more sinister in their attentions (including her father’s heir). The arrival of the cheerful Admiral Croft and his wife compounds Anne’s grief. Their happy relationship is a mirror to the life and family Anne could have had if she’d married the now successful and rich Captain Wentworth (a young Ciarán Hinds, who could have given Colin Firth a run for his money if the props department had handed him a bucket of water instead of an umbrella). Persuasion is a little different from other Austen adaptations: there’s no snappy pacing, upbeat score or choreographed balls. Instead, the film was shot on location and in chronological order, using mostly natural light. When Anne is reunited with Captain Wentworth, for example, a dolly zoom is used to show her emotionally reeling. It’s an odd choice for a period drama, but it works. Of course, there’s the usual romantic drama. Anne is forced to watch as Wentworth courts a younger, sillier girl, there’s a near-tragic accident, and a bit of jealousy from Wentworth when another man shows interest in Anne. However, as much as Persuasion is a story about second chances, it’s also about a woman learning to be true to herself. When the action shifts to Bath, Anne finally finds her backbone; first, refusing to suck up to a rich upper-class cousin, and again, when she flatly rejects her bossy neighbour’s instructions to court her father’s heir. There’s no question parts of the film are dry and require patience, especially if you’re a fan of the shinier 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice. Yet Persuasion feels far more relatable in the modern day. There’s the ache of lost opportunity, uncertainty about the future, and the curse of being surrounded by people forced upon you by circumstance, not choice. Overall, it’s the sincerity of the film that wins the audience over. Persuasion is the perfect balm for anyone feeling a little downtrodden. It reminds us no matter what missteps we make, there might be hope of a happy ending after all."
"Hi, Increasingly Anxious Journalist Jan Fran here to share the 10 funniest things I’ve seen on the internet. I spend a lot of time on the internet, which is how I acquired the tiny brain injury that prevents me from concentrating on any given task for longer than 90 seconds. I’m also addicted to a number of social media platforms, which is destroying my relationships, peace of mind and general ability to think deeply lol. Will I ever stop going on the internet? Of course not! I will continue going on the internet until it destroys every single thing in my life that I know and love and deem precious. Let’s get into it shall we. The internet is not a series of tubes. We now know this! But there was a time when we did not. Please enjoy one of the first viral videos on YouTube. Vintage YouTube is the best YouTube (can you tell I’m a geriatric millennial yet?) This person is absolutely the worst and yet I love her. To date, I have not found a better interview. Another vintage reference from the Year of our Lord 2008, which was a simpler time that I wish to return to. This was a top-level fight and the only thing that could have made it better is if it was dubbed over in hushed tones. Fortunately, one benevolent human on the internet has done us this kindness. I went to a Kosher Deli in Miami once and could not stop eating the entree pickles. Believe me, I wanted to stop, but I simply couldn’t. I even drank the pickle juice. All this to say I’m here for this video on a number of levels and so are 37 million other idiots. Not “funny” per se but very necessary indeed. Finally, an explanation of the universe that the layperson can understand. Anne Edmonds is very, very funny. That’s all. We’ve all been through internet drama but never like this. This is actually my mother. I’ve watched a lot of Ben Shapiro videos. In fact, I watched so many Ben Shapiro videos I started having dreams about Ben Shapiro. This was my subconscious begging me to stop watching Ben Shapiro videos. The best thing about anything Ben Shaprio says is that it’s quite often easily debunkable, ie… This story encapsulates Donald Trump in the best possible way. And who else would have a Trump story like this except someone like Charlie Sheen."
"Quite the strangest film of the year: the glam art-pop duo Sparks – Ron and Russell Mael – have created what fans think may be their masterpiece: a colossal movie-opera melodrama, directed by the French auteur Leos Carax. Adam Driver plays a moody LA standup comedian who is in love with an opera singer played by Marion Cotillard. Together, they have a baby (named Annette) who looks weirdly like a marionette doll and this semi-alien creature’s own staggering singing voice enraptures the world and leads her father to a tragic destiny. Freaky. 3 September. This documentary tells the story of the famous violin maker Antonio Stradivari (1644-1737) through the work of Dutch violinist Janine Jansen. Jansen sets out to record an album accompanied on the piano by Royal Opera House director Antonio Pappano, using 12 of Stradivari’s most treasured instruments, each a priceless object, while delving into the histories of these violins and into the personality of the Strad legend himself. 3 September. Phyllida Lloyd, director of The Iron Lady and Mamma Mia!, takes on the tough, absorbing story of a woman fighting back against spousal abuse and homelessness. Clare Dunne plays Sandra, a young woman in Dublin with two daughters, living in fear of her abusive and unstable ex-partner. Confronted with the prospect of homelessness, she investigates the possibility of actually building her own home using a template she finds online and a grant, with the help of friends played by Conleth Hill and Harriet Walter. A richly humane drama. 10 September. Writer-directors Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor have created an eerie, uncanny mystery thriller for arthouse audiences, shot with cool blankness and emotional distance. A troubled young woman called Rose, played by Ann Skelly, has recently found out she was adopted, and also discovered the identity of her birth mother: a successful TV star, played by Orla Brady, whom she begins to stalk. And then, posing as a young woman called “Julie”, she begins to track down her birth father, another celebrity, disquietingly played by Aidan Gillen. She is playing a very dangerous game. 17 September. For all those who have been re-bingeing The Sopranos in lockdown, this is a must-see. David Chase has co-written a prequel movie to his HBO series, featuring Michael Gandolfini as the young Tony Soprano, showing us how this smart, promising student swerved into crime – Michael being the son of the late James Gandolfini, who played the New Jersey crime boss when the TV show was in its pomp. Corey Stoll plays the young Uncle Junior, Vera Farmiga is Livia Soprano, Billy Magnussen is the young Paulie Walnuts, and Ray Liotta is a grandee of the Moltisanti family. 22 September. The 007 brand has been a bit tarnished lately, with the new James Bond movie abruptly pulled from the release schedules for a second time and many cinemas blaming this letdown on their temporary closure. At any rate, here it comes: Daniel Craig is hanging up his Walther PPK, his tux and sky-blue swimming briefs and bowing out of the 007 role with the latest Bond thriller. Veteran Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have teamed up with Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge for what is purportedly a funnier, savvier Bond for Craig’s last hurrah. 30 September. Malgorzata Szumowska is a brilliant Polish film-maker whose movie Mug was a mysterious parable of the Polish and European soul. Now, sharing a directing credit with cinematographer Michal Englert, she returns with a deeply weird story of a masseur with supernatural powers who visits a gated community of the Polish bourgeoisie and exposes their secret fears. 15 October. The intriguing screenwriting team of Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Nicole Holofcener take on a potent true story from medieval France which has assumed the standing of Arthurian myth, and Ridley Scott directs. Matt Damon plays a knight, Sir Jean De Carrouges, who accuses his friend Sir Jacques Le Gris, played by Adam Driver, of raping his wife Marguerite, played by Jodie Comer. King Charles VI, played by Affleck, decrees that there is only one way to settle this: a trial by combat between the two men, on the understanding that God will create the just outcome. If De Carrouges loses, Marguerite will be burned at the stake for her false accusation. Criminal justice was exciting in those days. 15 October. This is an epic new adaptation of the classic sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert from 1965. Or rather, it is the first of two projected movies that will only cover the first half of the book. It takes some chutzpah to take on a movie adaptation that was last attempted by David Lynch, but this is what Denis Villeneuve has done, having already shown he has the sci-fi chops with his films Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. Oscar Isaac, Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson star. 22 October. Once again, Wes Anderson brings his Olympic-level standard of drollery and quirk, in a style that is now endlessly spoofed by an army of YouTube admirers, who never quite nail it. As with The Grand Budapest Hotel (inspired by Stefan Zweig), Anderson gives us an upmarket literary-tourist vision of Europe, here inspired by New Yorker correspondents such as SN Behrman and Mavis Gallant. An American paper’s French bureau enterprisingly reports on the rich world of a little town called Ennui-sur-Blasé. It stars Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and many more. 22 October. Edgar Wright, one of Britain’s brightest movie talents, returns with a psychological London horror with a time-travel theme, set both in the present and in the glamorous yet seedy world of swinging 60s London. It’s co-written with smart new talent Krysty Wilson-Cairns (who also co-scripted 1917 with Sam Mendes). Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomasin McKenzie star, and there’s some connoisseur 60s casting with the appearances of Terence Stamp and Rita Tushingham. The now sadly departed stars Diana Rigg and Margaret Nolan give their final performances in this film. 29 October. Swiss director Andreas Fontana has had a critical hit on the festival circuit with his debut feature: an intriguing and mysterious drama set among the super-rich and super-corrupt, based on real events from the 1980s. A discreet and elegant Swiss private banker (Fontana is himself the grandson of one such) arrives in Argentina just as the junta begins to tighten its stranglehold on the country. His mission is to reassure his nervous high-net-worth clients from Argentina’s good families about their investments, and also about the disappearance of his own partner, which has spread a miasma of unease. 29 October. Chloé Zhao is the film-maker lauded for her Oscar-winning docu-realist masterpiece Nomadland. This couldn’t be more different. It’s a Marvel superhero film about a mighty race of aliens who have been living on Earth for millennia, but come out of shadowy hiding to battle against mankind’s enemy, the Deviants. The project was unveiled at the San Diego Comic-Con way back in 2019, and features Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden and Gemma Chan. 5 November. Here is the richly conceived, deeply intelligent second part to Joanna Hogg’s autofictional movie The Souvenir, the completion of her self-portrait of the artist as a young woman. Honor Swinton-Byrne returns, more elegant and impressive than ever, as Julie, a young film student now working on a graduation project which she hopes will make sense of the tragic relationship detailed in the first film. Tilda Swinton (Honor’s actual mother) returns as Julie’s mother and Richard Ayoade is back with his outrageous scene-stealer as Julie’s dyspeptic fellow student Patrick. 5 November. Writer-director and American new wave veteran Paul Schrader returns with a tale bearing his classic motifs: masculinity, loneliness, obsession. Oscar Isaac plays Tell, a professional gambler making a living in the eternal night of the casino. He is approached by Cirk, a young man played by Tye Sheridan who wants Tell’s help in murdering an enemy of his – someone Cirk has good reason to think Tell hates too. But Tell instead tries to redeem and mentor Cirk by taking him on the road as his gambling apprentice, setting his sights on winning the Poker World Series.  5 November. Whoever it is you were gonna call, you’d better call ’em again. This new Ghostbusters is a conventional threequel – effectively a follow-up to Ghostbusters 2 (and so standing apart from the 2016 gender-switch reboot). Thirty years on from the original story, two children and their single mom discover their link to the original ghostbusting heroes. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver appear in elder-statesperson roles (Harold Ramis, sadly, died in 2014). 11 November. Kenneth Branagh brings us his most personal film to date with this drama about a young boy growing up in the late 1960s in Northern Ireland, as the poison of the Troubles begins to spread. Newcomer Jude Hill plays the kid and an impressive cast, including Jamie Dornan, Caitriona Balfe, and Judi Dench, play the friends and family around him. 12 November. Still speedy, still needy, still eerily boyish, Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell returns in this present-day sequel to Top Gun. The esteemed US Navy pilot played by Tom Cruise could be piloting a desk by now, but he prefers to be a badass warrior of the skies. Jennifer Connelly (a mere nine years Cruise’s junior) is now the love interest. Miles Teller plays Rooster Bradshaw, the son of Goose Bradshaw, who was played by Anthony Edwards in the first film. Could it be that this film will finally acknowledge the homoeroticism famously described by Top Gun superfans Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino? Probably not. 19 November. Céline Sciamma follows up her hit period drama Portrait of a Lady on Fire with this fairytale ghost story about childhood and memory. An eight-year-old girl is playing in woodland just behind a house belonging to her late grandma, where her mum is doing the sad clear-out job following the funeral. And it is in this enchanted forest that the girl finds another little girl beckoning to her, asking her to come and play. She is the girl’s mirror image (they are played by twins) and after a while it becomes clear this is her mum, magically transported back in time to her daughter’s age. A beautiful and delicate parable. 19 November."
"On Late Night, Seth Meyers celebrated the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19, which will have the official name “Comirnaty”. “This is amazing news, because it will hopefully convince more people to get vaccinated, and we should all be thrilled,” said Meyers. “But also huge news that I guess we finally ran out of pharmaceutical names,” he added. “What’s up with Comirnaty? Did the approval catch Pfizer so off guard that they yelled out a name before they were ready? “It already had a great name: Pfizer vaccine,” he continued. “I mean, I understand using a complicated name like Viberzi or Xifaxan for IBS drugs so you don’t have to ask your doctor about, I don’t know, ‘diarrhea-be-gone’.” The name comes from the term “Covid-19 immunity”, with “mRNA”, the shot’s underlying technology, embedded in the middle, and is “meant to evoke the word community”. “God, it’s like a riddle Tom Hanks would have to solve in the Da Vinci Code to find out the location of the Holy Grail,” Meyers said. The Moderna vaccine, meanwhile, will be called “Spikevax”, which “sounds like a vaccine that protects you from Covid and gives you a mohawk, or one of those sketchy boner pills they have at the bodega”, Meyers joked. “Spikevax sounds like the drugs teens are using in a YA sci-fi series called, I don’t know, the Nestworld Chronicles? “This is huge news and will hopefully be super helpful in persuading more people to take the vaccine,” he added. “Of course, another thing that might be helpful would be getting Donald Trump, the leader of the Republican party, to tell his supporters to get it.” Friends and allies of the former president have been “desperately trying to persuade him to promote the Covid vaccine to his supporters” for months, said Meyers, “and promotion is the one thing he should be good at. He is a salesman and a marketer, and it’s not like he needs full FDA approval to push a product.” Trump did, in his pre-Oval Office days, sell a line of scam vitamins. “So it should come as no surprise” that Trump’s comment in support of the vaccine at a rally in Alabama over the weekend – “I recommend take the vaccines! I did it, it’s good, take the vaccines” – was met with boos from the crowd. “That really illustrates the core problem of the Trump movement: yes, his followers listen to him, but he also listens to them,” said Meyers. “In fact, he doesn’t just listen to them, he’s desperate for their approval and terrified of pissing them off.” Jimmy Fallon also cheered the FDA’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine on Monday’s Tonight Show. “It’s about time! Their statement started with ‘hey sorry, just saw this,’” he joked. “This is great news,” he added, “although if it didn’t get approved, I’m not really sure what the options were. Pfizer store credit? “Must be weird, working at the FDA – one day you’re approving a life-saving vaccine, the next you’re approving new s’mores-flavored Oreos.” Fallon poked fun at the name Comirnaty, which “sounds more like a drunk person trying to say ‘community’.” Fallon also recapped the disastrous host search at the flagship trivia show Jeopardy! – on Friday, the show’s executive producer, Mike Richards, stepped down as the successor to the beloved late host Alex Trebek after a report by the Ringer resurfaced derogatory comments he made on his comedy podcast in 2013 and 2014 as well as a history of lawsuits and problematic behavior. Richards had held the post for one day of filming and five episodes. “Come on, half the contestants last longer than he did,” Fallon mused. Richards will remain as the show’s executive producer, which is “not a great look on his résumé”, Fallon joked. “It’s like having your jobs listed as ‘Wendy’s cashier, Wendy’s manager, Wendy’s cashier.’”"
"As restrictions on movement intensify due to Covid-19, the lure of country life is ever strengthening. Lockdowns present a poignant time for those of us who are city bound to imagine a tree change from the comfort of the couch but, if you really want to understand rural life in Australia, Australia’s Food Bowl is a great place to start. Hosted by charismatic and committed Mildura restaurateur Stefano de Pieri and currently streaming on SBS On Demand, Australia’s Food Bowl makes the Murray and Darling-Barka rivers the stars of the show. Australia’s Food Bowl is lush with bountiful fresh food, hard-working people, the pleasures of eating; yet food production and community life are shown to be reliant on ecosystems that are under extreme pressure. The river system is in strife. De Pieri visits all manner of growers across the rich red-soiled Mallee region. Innovation in agriculture is his central theme and it is occurring on many fronts in response to a suite of pressures. Take brothers Paul and Craig, who shifted their large acreage from grapes to snow peas a decade ago. We learn that their experiment with ground cover crops and mulching has reduced their usage of scarce water by an astonishing 50%. De Pieri also meets Barkandji elder Peter Peterson and learns of the river as the spiritual and ecological source that connects all living things. De Pieri enjoys a riverside barbecue of kangaroo rissoles, mash and snow peas cooked by his former apprentices, local Aboriginal women Whitney and Tamara. Standing with fifth-generation farmer Rachel Strachan, Stefano shares the jubilation as water flows across the parched Darling-Barka riverbed for the first time in two years. The compounding water crisis has led Strachan to destroy decades-old citrus plantations and grapevines and replace them with sheep. She has also become a formidable campaigner for fairer water allocation and regulation. The series brings to the fore just how important it is to understanding the interconnections of things. Almond trees cannot produce nuts without the pollination of bees. Communities of fish, birds, animals and people cannot survive without water flowing through their rivers. Commitments to place run deep out here – despite intensifying pressures, people don’t talk of moving to the city. The elephant in the room, subtly invoked, is the need for far better and fairer regulation of water flow by governments. Australia’s Food Bowl makes a striking contrast with other streaming offerings on the theme of rural life, none more so than the ABC’s Movin’ to the Country. In that show, we meet “gutsy entrepreneurs” and “dreamers” who have decamped from the city, ostensibly for a simpler life. Such as the story of Richard and Ian, who bought a law firm in central New South Wales and expanded it into a national business via a $6m purpose-built digital platform. Not content to stop there, courtesy of genetic experimentation, the couple also invented a new species of red wagyu beef cattle for export to a “super-premium” market. Then there is Toni, who left a high-flying Wall Street career to take up sheep farming in central Victoria. Her marketing eye soon hit upon the idea of selling a new kind of bacon made from lamb bellies. Before the pandemic closed international borders, Toni was vigorously pursuing export contracts in the Middle East. Movin’ to the Country’s cheerful individual success stories pile up but any sense of how these connect to life on the ground, or to any idea of rural community, is missing. What this series delivers is rather a celebration of the commercialisation of ideas, and an extractivist attitude that many argue continues to wreak havoc in the bush, most evidently in the profit-driven imperatives of foreign ag-investors. Back on the Murray, standing in the middle of an expansive almond grove, De Pieri introduces an intergenerational Anglo-Australian farmer to the sheer delight of eating young green nuts straight from the tree. In this simple but intimate moment of exchange across cultural traditions, something vital is communicated of how communities are cultivated and sustained. What Australia’s Food Bowl demonstrates is that securing a future for regional Australia will not turn on the arrival of a new stream of individuals primed for their own success and ready to move on when markets draw them elsewhere. Rather, it will turn upon shared recognition of unprecedented challenges and interdependent needs, desires and responsibilities. Addressing those of us watching on, de Pieri subtly extends the edges of his community outwards: “We all have a stake in making sure we have healthy rivers.”"
"I was very interested in your editorial on Antwerp (17 August). I have had the opportunity to visit that fine city several times over the last 20 years, collaborating with curators there. It is an underrated city today and, as you state, English traders sold wool there in the past; we also bought their lace in the 17th and 18th centuries. This week The Bowes Museum sent a crate of some of the finest 17th- and 18th-century Flemish lace to a large, prestigious exhibition in Antwerp that highlights the important role the city played in the production and trade of lace. P.LACE.S – Looking through Antwerp Lace, opens on 25 September. A city trail connects five exhibition locations in the city.Joanna HashagenCurator of fashion and textiles, The Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle, County Durham"
"“In order to claim that what’s happening in Afghanistan right now came out of nowhere, you have to willfully ignore or erase 20 years of history,” said Seth Meyers on Wednesday evening. “The Washington elite repeatedly lied about how the war was going, which is exactly what so many in the media, and especially the rightwing ghouls who got us into this mess – the Karl Roves, the John Boltons of the world – have been doing.” The Late Night host zeroed in on the former White House press secretary-turned-Fox News contributor Kayleigh McEnany, who appeared on the network on Tuesday and “made it clear she’s fully inhabiting an alternate reality”. McEnany excoriated Biden for his handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan and added: “When Trump was president, you didn’t see crisis after crisis. I shudder to think about what Covid would’ve been like under Biden.” “Well she’s right about one thing: you didn’t see crisis after crisis if you were watching Fox,” Meyers retorted. “More than 400,000 Americans died from Covid under Trump. Also, he got it and his rallies and White House parties were super-spreader events. Trump personally helped spread more disease to more people than a community swimming pool filled with water from the East River.” Meyers went on with just a partial accounting of Trump’s scandals: “To say that Trump didn’t cycle through crisis after crisis is to ignore that much of his inner circle got indicted, his cabinet had like half a dozen corruption scandals, he praised Nazis, kidnapped migrant children, fired or tried to fire the people investigating him, got caught paying hush money to a porn star, incited a violent insurrection to overthrow an election, helped Saudi Arabia cover up a murder, single-handedly caused the longest government shutdown in American history, and told the Boy Scouts a story about yachts and New York parties.” He saved his ire for GOP figureheads such as Bolton, Rove and McEnany who have been “opining shamelessly on cable news about how they would’ve handled the situation [in Afghanistan], and the pro-Trump crowd that negotiated and celebrated the deal with Taliban to withdraw are hypocritically piling on Biden for following through”. On the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon discussed a reassurance from Johnson & Johnson that their booster shot provides a “rapid and robust” increase in Covid antibodies. “Kinda like Chef Boyardee saying ‘our new sauce is robust in flavor’,” he said. In other health risk news, doctors have taken to the media to warn of the dangers of the milk crate challenge, in which people climb a pyramid of stacked crates. “Half of Americans said, ‘of course’, while the other half said, ‘It’s my choice and I want to do my own research,’” Fallon joked. “Seriously, imagine surviving a global pandemic then having your family find out the milk crate challenge is what got you.” And in a dramatic reversal, OnlyFans will continue to allow sexually explicit content, days after it announced a ban. “So between this and the new Spider-Man trailer, what a week for teenage boys,” said Fallon. “Thank goodness because without this, where else would be you able to find this stuff online?”"
"Born in South Africa, David Lan trained as an actor before gaining a PhD in social anthropology at the London School of Economics. He has been a writer in residence at London’s Royal Court theatre (1995-97) and was artistic director of the Young Vic from 2000 to 2018, when he received the Laurence Olivier special award for his role in productions such as The Jungle and The Inheritance. Lan’s memoir, As If By Chance: Journeys, Theatres, Lives, is published by Faber on 20 February.  Madonna’s Madame X tour I caught this in New York, where I’m producing at the moment. It’s “Wow!” modulated a hundred different ways. It kicks off with James Baldwin (“artists are here to disturb the peace”), then dives into Madame X’s recent adventures (“As you all know, I moved to Lisbon to become a soccer mom”), features her hits old and brand new, stops off for a thrilling fado section, then for the all-female Orquestra Batukadeiras from Cape Verde. It whirls to an end with the first lady of the brave and the crazed encircled by a chorus of black women intoning “I’m not your bitch!”, herself hurling out the coda: “Have we made ourselves clear?” Yup. Migrant, Refugee, Smuggler, Saviour by Peter Tinti and Tuesday Reitano One of the last shows I produced at the Young Vic was The Jungle, which recreates the Calais refugee and migrant camp. As preparation I read many of the recent books about the vast currents of people desperate to escape conflict and the degradation of their lives. This one contains the most adventurous analysis. The title says it all: if you leave your home because otherwise you’ll starve, you’re a migrant; if it’s because bombs are falling on your village, you’re a refugee. Those who help you cross borders may be criminals profiting from your defencelessness, but it may be those same thugs who save your life. Golborne Road, London W10 Golborne Road (off Portobello Road, North Kensington) was once part of the great forest of Middlesex; today you won’t see too many trees. It’s a laid-back, apparently accidental intersection of Portuguese, Spanish, Moroccan and English cuisine, art, patisserie, old furniture and street market, all in the shadow of thebrutalist Grade II*-listed Trellick Tower, designed by the Hungarian-born Ernő Goldfinger.It’s a great weekend hangout. There’s a grilled fish stall that spirits you back to the Jemaa el-Fnaa in Marrakech. My favourite local restaurant is Zayane, run by the Mortell family from Casablanca: their tagines sizzle almost all the way to the last bite. The Wild Pear Tree (dir. Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2018) Ceylan makes the kind of film where you go, “No, honestly, I can’t face a three-hour, glacially slow, landscape-driven work of genius that opens out into being about everything that matters in the modern world. C’mon let’s see Psycho one more time.” But then you think, “If I don’t watch Once Upon a Time in Anatolia or Winter Sleep tonight, maybe tomorrow Armageddon will arrive and I’ll die the poorer for it” – so you do and you have the best evening of cinema you can imagine. The Wild Pear Tree is his latest invisibly crafted submersion into the psyche of contemporary Turkey. It’s as folksy and civilised as Tolstoy. Message in a Bottle, Peacock theatre, London Do art houses die when they lose connection to the street? Probably. Contrariwise, street artists are keen to blast their way into art houses, if only because a box office is a more efficient way to earn a living than passing round a hat. For two decades, Sadler’s Wells’s Breakin’ Convention weekend has been a revelatory festival of hip-hop, the spectacular dance form born on the streets of the Bronx in the 1970s. In Message in a Bottle, choreographed by Kate Prince to old favourites by Sting, the exuberance of the street is all there, but in this tale of the journeys of three refugees, the young dancers’ heartstopping technique ripens into emotional resonance and meaning. Edwin black jeans Maybe 35 years ago I saw my friend, the actor Roger Rees, in a show. I’ve no memory of the show but I do remember he was wearing stylish black jeans. I’ve been wearing black jeans ever since, not in homage to Roger, but because it means I can wear the same trousers wherever and whenever. The idea of clothes that draw attention to yourself is repellent: surely the point of couture is to enable you to disappear. Occasionally I have to go to some formal do and get out the tux, but all the men are wearing the same monkey suits, so you can disappear just as effectively."
"Taking its title from a Zadie Smith line, Collapsed in Sunbeams is the much-anticipated debut album from 20-year-old Londoner Arlo Parks. Released on 29 January, it’s breezy but heavy with lived emotion, Parks’s 12 songs locating a very British meeting place between torch songs and rhythm. US born, UK raised, Celeste has been ubiquitous in 2020, clocking up her first top 10 hit on a charity single. Finally, she drops her soulful and sophisticated full-length project, Not Your Muse, on 26 February. Kitty Empire God knows, we all need a bit of light relief. Fortunately, there are plenty of comedy options on offer in the early part of 2021. First up is the scalding Promising Young Woman (12 February), a ballsy assault on rape culture written and directed by Killing Eve showrunner Emerald Fennell, and starring Carey Mulligan at the top of her always impressive game. Scheduled to stream on Amazon Prime in March is Coming 2 America, starring Eddie Murphy, reprising his role as Akeem, heir to the throne of Zamunda. Also due to launch on Amazon in the UK in early 2021 is Palm Springs, an inventive new spin on the Groundhog Day format that sees Andy Samberg trapped in an endlessly replaying wedding. Meanwhile, Michelle Pfeiffer gets her perfectly manicured nails into a dream of a role, as an ageing socialite in French Exit (26 February), which is based on the novel by Patrick DeWitt. Wendy Ide From 4 January, the redoubtable Emma Barnett will host Woman’s Hour every day from Monday to Thursday, with other presenters trying out on the Friday slot. It’s a big change for Barnett, who’s used to the rangy freedom of a three-hour show (her morning slot on 5 Live), with the peppy to-and-fro of political interviews and the spontaneity of listeners calling in. Woman’s Hour has long been far more sedate and tightly packaged. Now Barnett’s in, you have a feeling this may change. Miranda Sawyer After the success of The Jungle, Good Chance joins forces with Handspring Puppet Company, which created War Horse, for a travelling festival in support of refugees, directed by Amir Nizar Zuabi. The star is a 3.5-metre-high puppet, Little Amal, a representative of displaced children, who on 30 March will set off to walk more than 8,000km, through 70 cities, towns and villages, from the Syrian-Turkish border to the UK, bringing together artists, cultural institutions and humanitarian organisations in one of the largest and largest-hearted public art works ever made. Follow the journey onlline: walkwithamal.org. Susannah Clapp Plague restrictions permitting, a resurgence of great exhibitions is due. First is the Royal Academy’s Francis Bacon: Man and Beast (currently scheduled for 30 January). Bacon painted dogs, hawks, monkeys and baboons as if they were human, and people as if they were creatures. Eventually the two become savagely indistinguishable. From 6 March, in Dürer’s Journeys, the National Gallery presents Albrecht Dürer as Europe’s first great tourist, drawing walruses in Belgium and whales in Zeeland. Witness the strange influence of Italy on his work. Tate Modern homes in on Australian art in the year 1992 (15 February) and the pioneering figures of Rodin (29 April), while Yorkshire Sculpture Park has Breaking the Mould, an epochal survey of women’s sculpture from Barbara Hepworth to Rachel Whiteread (13 March). In contemporary art, look out for the fantastical dreams of Kenyan-born painter Michael Armitage (Royal Academy from 13 March) alongside David Hockney’s evergreen spring paintings (from 27 March). And Yayoi Kusama’s mirrored Infinity Rooms return on 29 March, by popular demand, to baffle viewers at Tate Modern. Laura Cumming The seven concerts in the Hallé orchestra’s winter/spring season, from Manchester’s Bridgewater Hall and Hallé St Peter’s, show variety and flair. The opener (14 January) features the poet laureate Simon Armitage and saxophonist Jess Gillam, conducted by Jonathon Heyward, with a world premiere, Where Is the Chariot of Fire, by Hannah Kendall. Pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason plays Beethoven (28 January); the Hallé’s rising star, assistant conductor Delyana Lazarova, conducts Shostakovich (25 February); Mark Elder conducts a staged performance of Stravinsky’s The Soldier’s Tale (18 March), directed by Annabel Arden. The Norwegian violinist-composer Henning Kraggerud, artist in residence, has devised a mixed repertoire programme which he will direct, including Brahms’s String Sextet No 1. The season ends with a world premiere from Huw Watkins, his Symphony No 2, and Boris Giltburg as solo pianist in Rachmaninoff’s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini (25 March). Available online; a subscription services gives you access to them all. Fiona Maddocks The main theme of this year’s Format photo festival in Derby is “control”, and the curators have sought, through an open call to photographers across the globe, to explore the concept in all its myriad forms. The contrasts are often dynamic. Highlights include Marco di Noia’s viscerally powerful images of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong and Heather Agyepong’s conceptual reimagining of the legacy of Aida Overton Walker, a popular African American vaudeville performer who challenged the casually racist stereotypes that dogged black performers in the early 1900s. As ever, a deftly curated festival that reflects the breadth of contemporary photography. Runs 12 March–11 April at various venues and online; see formatfestival.com. Sean O’Hagan The giant of US film art, famous for his visionary Cremaster Cycle, returns to Britain for the first time in over a decade with an epic new work set in Idaho’s Sawtooth Mountains. Redoubt, at London’s Hayward Gallery from 17 March, fuses classical, cosmological and American myths about humanity’s relationship with nature, and stars the artist himself in a snowbound choreography featuring animals, trees and elusive dancers. Hailed in the US as Barney’s most powerful work yet, it will be shown in a forest of sculptures. LC London’s Barbican gives us Brutal Beauty, the first show of this weird, wild and zany French painter in over half a century. His interest in raw art, the art of the mentally ill, and the untrained, from caveman to graffiti artist, fed directly into his brilliantly coloured and expressive work, using everything from tar and asphalt to spray paint and plaster. Expect to be startled by his spontaneity and the way his work seems to be the source of so much that followed. Opens 11 February. LC Winter’s plunges into high tiers for most of the country stopped a lot of dance plans in their tracks. Fortunately, Sadler’s Wells’ next showpiece was planned with the BBC for broadcast on iPlayer and the Sadler’s Wells website. Dancing Nation, on 14 January, is a one-day digital festival featuring three hour-long chunks of dance from some of Britain’s best companies. Highlights include Akram Khan and Natalia Osipova performing together for the first time in Mud of Sorrow: Touch, a revival of Matthew Bourne’s brilliant Spitfire, which mashes a ballet classic and an underwear advert, and a second outing for Shobana Jeyasingh’s Contagion, a reflection on coronavirus. Other performers include Birmingham Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Oona Doherty and Boy Blue. Meanwhile, the enterprising Rosie Kay is hoping to relieve the gloom with a new production of Romeo + Juliet, told through the lens of gang culture in a stifling Birmingham summer in 2021. The topical and intriguing piece is due to premiere at the Birmingham Hippodrome on 17 March. Many fingers are very firmly crossed for its arrival. Sarah Crompton Project 17, on the World Service from 20 January, is an ambitious series that features 17 17-year-olds from 17 countries. Each one will examine one of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which were set in 2015. Have they worked? Are they being met? We begin with the engaging Lanre, in Leeds, who wants to know why a rich country like the UK can’t eradicate poverty... The Battersea Poltergeist, out on 21 January on BBC Sounds, tells the true story of 63 Wycliffe Road, an ordinary house in south London in 1956. Strange events start happening around a teenager, Shirley Hitchings. Are they caused by a poltergeist? Danny Robins presents (he speaks to an 80-year-old Shirley) and a high quality cast, including Toby Jones and Alice Lowe, recreate dramatic scenes, with spooky music by Nadine Shah and Ben Hillier. Not quite so spooky is Jon Holmes and chums’ new spoof true crime series, Cold Case Crime Cuts (due early February), which promises to thoroughly investigate crimes in songs, from Barry Manilow’s Copacabana to Bob Marley’s I Shot the Sheriff to Richard Marx’s Hazard. MS If you’re ready for some heftier viewing after the distractions of the silly season, an influx of excellent documentaries awaits in early 2021. 15 January brings festival hit MLK/FBI, a gripping, eye-opening account of the FBI’s surveillance and interference in the activism of Martin Luther King through the 1950s and 60s, as well as the first essential documentary on the coronavirus pandemic, 76 Days, an emotionally pummelling fly-on-the-wall study of Wuhan hospital activity in the city’s early lockdown. If you’re after a lighter crowdpleaser, delicious doc The Truffle Hunters – a wry, gentle portrait of the elderly men pursuing the elusive Alba truffle in Italy’s Piedmont region – arrives in on 5 February. Things get serious again in March, with Oscar-winning director Bryan Fogel’s sharp, sobering The Dissident (5 March), a probing investigation of the disappearance and death of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. After a year heavy on isolation, such documentaries offer a welcome reconnection with the world. Guy Lodge Details remain scant about Certified Lover Boy – Drake’s sixth studio album, due in January on OVO – but a moody trailer suggests a legend-building set, focusing on this rapper’s strongest suit: his many feelings. First scheduled for autumn 2020, Lana Del Rey’s long-awaited new outing, Chemtrails Over the Country Club, has no official release date due to a vinyl pressing delay, but a good guess would be March. KE A new home for a 400-year-old ecclesiastical library second only to the Vatican in importance. The new Lambeth Palace Library, due to open in March, by Wright & Wright is a nine-storey brick tower that aims to protect the collections from flooding and fire risk, and make them more accessible, while minimising impact on the gardens of Lambeth Palace. It has already been battered on Twitter by conservative commentators who would like something more traditional. You could alternatively see it as a thoughtful response to a challenging brief. Meanwhile, the next instalment is due for The Illuminated River, the plan to make 14 Thames bridges into “a free outdoor art project” by Leo Villareal, the artist best known for bringing light and love to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, forever the ugly sister of the Golden Gate. Four bridges have been animated by his slow-moving coloured lighting since July 2019. Early this year, five more will join them, from Blackfriars to Lambeth. Rowan Moore Northern Irish noir, anyone? James Nesbitt stars in this cat-and-mouse BBC One crime thriller, written by exciting new talent Chris Brandon and produced by Jed Mercurio. When a car is pulled out of Strangford Lough in County Down, police detective Tom Brannick (Nesbitt) connects it to a cold case close to his heart. The four-parter follows his high-stakes hunt for an infamous assassin known as “Goliath”. Gripping, psychologically complex and shedding light on the legacy of the Troubles. Dates TBC. Michael Hogan Larry Kramer’s largely autobiographical play about the Aids crisis in New York in 1980 will be directed by Dominic Cooke as part of the Olivier-in-the-round season at the National Theatre. In this co-production with Fictionhouse, Ben Daniels stars as the founder of an Aids advocacy group, alongside Danny Lee Wynter, Daniel Monks and Stanley Townsend. The set will be designed by Vicki Mortimer and the lighting by Paule Constable. Dates TBC. SC Prepare to see a lot of Vanessa Kirby’s face over the next few months. The British star, formerly a standout in The Crown, will be in the thick of the Oscar race for her gut-wrenching performance as a grieving mother in Pieces of a Woman, while she’ll be on screens again on 5 March in The World to Come, director Mona Fastvold’s exquisite American period tale of two frontier wives who fall in love. GL You don’t need to be a fan of Canadian auteur Tamara Lindeman’s previous works to access her band’s extraordinary new album, Ignorance (5 February). This is leftfield pop, elegant and danceable, brimming with orchestral touches and jazz feints. It harks backwards to Talk Talk and the 80s, but is alarmed by the here and now. Songs that seem to be about lost love double as nuanced odes to the planet we are losing. KE After losing £3 out of every £5 of income during the pandemic, the Royal Opera House is taking no risks for its first full staging since last March: its 2021 season plans to open with Puccini’s passionate thriller Tosca in Jonathan Kent’s classic staging, with Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko in the title role, and tenor Yusif Eyvazov (Mr Netrebko) and bass-baritone Gerald Finley leading the first of three casts. Dates TBC; live stream currently scheduled for 22 January. FM Mirth might be in short supply right now, but TV is at least serving up some laughs. David Tennant and Michael Sheen star in a second series of luvvies-in-lockdown comedy Staged on BBC One from 4 January. Although they’ll probably bicker over the order in which they’ve been named in that sentence. In mid-January comes Channel 4 reality series Stand Up & Deliver, which sees five game-for-a-giggle celebrities trying their hand at standup comedy. The brave quintet includes Reverend Richard Coles, Happy Mondays frontman Shaun Ryder and former Conservative MP Baroness Sayeeda Warsi. Each will be paired with an established comic – David Baddiel and Zoe Lyons among them – who’ll train them to compete for top billing at a live gig. Spring brings the third run of BBC Two’s school-gates sitcom Motherland, and, finally, the fourth season of French comedy word-of-mouth hit Call My Agent! hits Netflix on 21 January. Expect A-list cameos and chic Gallic gags. MH Fela Kuti’s influence lives on with twice the punch, thanks to Legacy+ (Partisan, 5 February), a double release from son Femi and grandson Made. The former’s album, Stop the Hate, keeps his father’s political flame alive, while the latter – who studied music at Trinity Laban Conservatoire in London, just as his ancestor did – throws Afrobeat to the future on For(e)ward with a freshness that recalls UK jazz acts Ezra Collective and Kokoroko. Kate Hutchinson  Chinese film-maker Chloé Zhao’s exquisite third film was a popular Golden Lion winner at Venice in the autumn, and went on to top many year-best lists across the pond (it’s released in the UK on 19 February). Blending documentary and narrative techniques, it stars Frances McDormand as an itinerant widow drifting across America, and merges her fictional story with the experiences of various nomads cast as themselves. The results are uniquely moving and adventurous: expect an armful of awards. GL New work brings the hope of spring. At Sheffield, writer Chris Bush and director Robert Hastie, who created the Sky Arts South Bank award-winning Standing at the Sky’s Edge, come together again for The Band Plays On, telling the Steel City’s recent history to a soundtrack of its music (Anthony Lau co-directs; 3–13 February). Paterson Joseph stars and, with Simon Godwin, co-directs his one-man show about the first black person of African origin to vote in Britain. Sancho: An Act of Remembrance is at the Lyric Hammersmith from 25 February–20 March. At Stratford East, Nadia Fall stages Dipo Baruwa-Etti’s The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars – about a young woman’s search for justice after her twin brother is murdered in a racist attack (3-20 February. The global online première of Lorien Haynes’s Good Grief, “a romantic comedy about grief”, can be seen from 15 February, featuring Sian Clifford and Nikesh Patel. Natalie Abrahami directs; Isobel Waller-Bridge composes the sound design and score. SC A new drama from Russell T Davies is always an event. His last two creations, after all, were Years and Years and A Very English Scandal. Now comes this long-gestating passion project, airing in late January on Channel 4. It charts the adventures of four friends throughout the 80s – the decade when everything changed for the gay community. Olly Alexander from Years & Years (the pop band, confusingly, not the TV show) leads the young cast, supported by experienced hands Keeley Hawes, Stephen Fry and Neil Patrick Harris. MH A socially distanced performance at London’s Barbican Hall that will also be broadcast online (6 February) promises to give Paul Weller’s works, old and new, a fresh dimension thanks to the BBC Symphony Orchestra, artistic-directed by Jules Buckley. As befits this restless, constantly evolving artist, sneak previews of songs from Weller’s forthcoming album, are also on the cards. Kitchen Sink, Nadine Shah’s jazz-goth fourth album, was one of 2020’s most provocative slow-burners, fixing its many guilty targets with an elegant death-stare. Shah – a south Tynesider with Norwegian and Pakistani heritage – will bring the album to life for the first time in its entirety as part of the live-streamed programme at the Barbican (30 March). Or as Shah puts it: “not any old shit-hole.” KE The V&A in South Kensington gets off to a flying start this spring with winged horses, bronze busts of ancient kings and illuminated visions of paradise on Earth in its long-awaited blockbuster Epic Iran (from 13 February). Art from 5,000 years will represent this historic civilisation, drawn from pre-biblical times to contemporary painting and photography. This is followed by the spectacularly immersive exhibition Curiouser and Curiouser (from 27 March), a celebration of anything and everything related to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Taking in film, theatre, ballet, fashion, art and more, from illustrations by Tenniel and Dalí to costumes, movies and virtual recreations of Lewis Carroll’s scenes and characters, this will be a fantastical trip in itself. And at V&A Dundee, the party continues with Night Fever: Designing Club Culture (from 27 March), exploring the way architecture and interior design merged with sound, light, fashion and graphic design in the evolution of nightclubs, including Studio 54, the Haçienda and the Ministry of Sound. LC With the likes of Des, Quiz and The Salisbury Poisonings proving big hits in 2020, the pipeline of fact-based crime drama shows no sign of slowing down. First to arrive is The Pembrokeshire Murders on ITV, starring Luke Evans as the detective on the trail of Welsh serial killer John Cooper (Keith Allen). On BBC Two is feature-length one-off Danny Boy, about real-life decorated soldier Brian Wood, accused of war crimes in Iraq by human rights lawyer Phil Shiner (Toby Jones), which resulted in the high-profile Al-Sweady inquiry. Finally, BBC One’s Four Lives tells the story of “Grindr Killer” Stephen Port from the perspective of his victims’ families. Stephen Merchant plays Port and Sheridan Smith co-stars. MH Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci are both on peak form in this watercolour-delicate British tearjerker (5 March), playing a longtime couple rocked by the ravages of early-onset dementia. A road movie that follows them on what may be their last holiday to the Lake District, it’s as simple as it is devastating, and a breakthrough of note for writer-director Harry Macqueen. GL Indie rock is one of Scotland’s most abundant natural resources. In an echo of Glasgow’s 90s pomp, three of the city’s most venerable (albeit now relocated) creative powerhouses have new projects due – on their own independent labels, naturally. Recorded during lockdown, Mogwai’s 10th album, As the Love Continues (19 February), maintains their sky-high quotient of “dreamlike grandeur”. Their more scabrous fellow travellers, Arab Strap, reunited in 2016 but only now deliver a new compendium of beat-laden gallows wit – As Days Get Dark (5 March), on Mogwai’s imprint, Rock Action. Balm comes in the form of deathless romantics Teenage Fanclub, Scotland’s answer to the Byrds, who present their 10th album, Endless Arcade (5 March). Gerard Love retired from the band in 2018, citing his reluctance to tour; his live replacement, former Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci frontman Euros Childs, rounds out this album’s poised mellifluousness. KE Stars in Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days at the Riverside Studios, London (February) and BBC One’s BloodlandsThree of my friends are releasing albums soons: Julia Stone with Sixty Summers; Imelda May, whose sixth album will include the brilliant single 11 Past the Hour; and Thomas Bartlett with Songs By My Friends. I’m really looking forward to the new Rachel Cusk novel Second Place, Susie Boyt’s Loved and Missed and Tracy K Smith’s new collection Such Color. The BBC’s Lights Up (which I am involved in) is bringing newly recorded stage productions to TV, and I’m particularly looking forward to the world premiere of David Ireland’s Sadie in February. His latest book, Kay’s Anatomy, was published last year and a TV series of his diary, This Is Going to Hurt, is currently in productionAlmost every opportunity to get out of the house in early 2021 looks rather TBC, so I’m focused on sofa-based entertainment. I’m particularly looking forward to Russell T Davies’s epic drama It’s a Sin, about the lives of young people during the Aids epidemic in 1980s London. The crisis was ignored for too long and, despite the loss of so many gay men, is often forgotten now. Russell’s unmatched skill at weaving humour with emotional gut-punches reassures me this important story is in safe hands. Former artistic director of the Young Vic theatre and a producer of Good Chance’s The Walk, which will see a giant refugee puppet journey across Europe from MarchA producer friend says the great thing about her life these days is she can plan far more ambitious shows than she’d ever dreamed of, because government advice will change and she’ll have to cancel them. I want to go to the theatre; I don’t really care what it is, provided the house is packed and abuzz with expectation, and there’s that rush of silence as the lights go down and an actor says something funny or alarming and you’re out of your life and in it. Curator of the 11th edition of the Liverpool Biennial, The Stomach and the Port, 20 March–6 JuneIn these challenging times I want to enrich my sense of togetherness critically, so I will be directing my attention towards The Showroom – one of the most exciting and cutting-edge art organisations in London, which focuses on collaborative approaches. In spring 2021, Beirut artist Haig Aivazian will hit the London art scene. Haig has a particular way of exploring how power moves people, architecture or landscape. I can’t wait. Singer and rapper, whose debut EP, The Red Room Intro (Yard Gyal Inna Britain), is out early this yearI love how versatile Drake is sonically and especially when he’s collaborated with the likes of Popcaan, Rihanna and Wizkid – it shows that he definitely champions African and Caribbean culture, which I can really appreciate because of my Jamaican background. We’ve had a taste of what will come from the new album, Certified Lover Boy (out in January), with the track Laugh Now, Cry Later, which feels a bit more like old-school Drake. I’m excited for what the album will bring (especially the memes)."
"Charles pours himself a large whiskey, shrugging off his sister’s appeals to calm down. William Shatner, who plays Charles, has ditched the Captain Kirk smirk for a haunted thousand-yard stare, though the signature halting delivery remains. “You should have seen it. Smelled it. Heard it. The playground stinks. Tennis shoes. Blood. Dirty bandages…” Shatner’s character has a phobia of playgrounds. As if the 1980s iteration of a playground isn’t terrifying enough in its own right, with its rusting slides, creaking swings and deadly roundabouts, Charles was tortured in one by bullies as a child. In the episode The Playground, he frets over taking his young son through the chicken-wire gates for the first time. As ever, with The Ray Bradbury Theater, there’s a fiendish twist. Amazon Prime is streaming five out of the six seasons of the HBO anthology that aired between 1985 and 1992. Kitsch, macabre, gloriously schlocky and sometimes flimsy (both the incidental music and the cheap sets with lashings of blue light), The Ray Bradbury Theater grew from the same cable-TV compost as The Twilight Zone (for which Bradbury also wrote), Tales from the Crypt, the George A. Romero-produced Tales from the Dark Side, Amazing Stories and, of course, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which began the anthology genre in the 1960s but had a second innings on cable in 1985. Bradbury, who died in 2012, was the prolific American author best known for Fahrenheit 451, but it’s his 1950s collections of short stories – such as The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Golden Apples of the Sun and The October Country – that are the basis for The Ray Bradbury Theater. The 80s saw a resurgence of interest in the 50s; not only in fashion and in music, but on screen: Back to the Future, Stand by Me and The Wonder Years were among the nostalgia hits.Perhaps Bradbury’s worries about dystopian society fed into the Cold War fears of the era. As he told The Guardian, he was preoccupied with the future from a young age, through the adventures of Buck Rogers, space expeditions and time machines. And there are many space-age episodes of The Ray Bradbury Theater, such as And the Moon Be Still as Bright, in which we learn with sinking familiarity that chickenpox wiped out a whole civilisation on Mars. “But what the hell. We made it. That’s all that matters, doesn’t it?” says the sole astronaut who feels affected by this. “I thought YOU would understand,” he says to the crew member of Cherokee descent. But there’s also much that mocks the mannerisms of Earthbound society. In Exorcism, bitter rivals at the Ladies Honeysuckle Harmony Lodge resort to witchcraft to undermine one another. In The Wonderful Death of Dudley Stone, a best-selling author at the top of his game is thrilled to be passed a note at his book signing that promises he will be murdered. “You have written too many books,” his would-be assassin moans. “How do I hate thee?” Stars include Jeff Goldblum (and his perfect hair) in The Town Where No One Got Off; Eugene Levy in The Skeleton as a hypochondriac who meets a grizzly end; and Leslie Nielsen as the enigmatically sinister Fantoccini in Marionettes, Inc. Things get meta when Drew Barrymore reads a Tales from the Crypt comic in The Screaming Woman. Bradbury himself appears at the beginning of each episode to introduce the plot, in the style of the British TV series Roald Dahl’s Tales of the Unexpected. The latter ran from 1979 to 1988, with stars such as Joan Collins and John Mills. Whereas Dahl addresses the viewer from a comfortable armchair by a roaring fire, Bradbury is surrounded by writerly clutter, curios and a typewriter. Untroubled by rave reviews in its initial run, The Ray Bradbury Theater is a lucky dip best played late at night. In fact, you’ve probably seen it before, in a haze after midnight, already feeling like you were entering a portal to some other eerie dimension."
"Miriam Margolyes has defended her controversial decision to reveal what she believes is the truth about the early death of the great British cellist Jacqueline du Pré. In her new memoir the actor claims that a mutual friend was responsible for secretly assisting the suicide of 42-year-old Du Pré, who was suffering the serious effects of multiple sclerosis. It is, Margolyes argues, now her duty to speak out, three decades on, although she knows some readers will question her right to tell such a private story. “I’m not sure I can answer that. But I felt it was such an important story about a very great artist, it should be known, a kind of public duty,” Margolyes explained in a recent interview for an upcoming issue of the Observer Magazine. The veteran actor, 80, who is perhaps best known today for playing Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter films, said she made “a deliberate decision” to include the allegation and that she wonders if others will come forward to back her up. Margolyes has a long reputation as an uncompromising plain-speaker and her book, This Much is True, is filled with naughty anecdotes and ribald stories. However, this particular astonishing reminiscence has upset members of Du Pré’s family, including her former husband, the pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim. Speaking to the Daily Mail, Barenboim has referred to Margolyes’ account as “unverifiable”, adding it has “absolutely nothing to do with the reality of Jackie’s passing”. In her memoir Margoyles recalls that her London therapist, Margaret Branch, who died in 1997, once confided that Du Pré had invited her to her Kensington home in 1987 to help put an end to her life. Branch, who had trained as a nurse, reportedly told Margolyes she arrived with a syringe and a lethal drug and carried out the wishes of the celebrated classical musician. Branch then asked Margolyes to keep the secret until after her death. “I felt it was wrong to say it then. And this time, I thought, it’s an important story. I think it’s wonderful. Heroic, actually,” said Margolyes, adding that she continued the friendship with Branch after her period of therapy. “I don’t know if she told anyone else … I think that I am the sort of person that people tell things to.” Oxford-born Du Pré, who played on two Stradivarius cellos, became a household name during the 1970s and is still regarded as one of the finest classical musicians of modern times. Her complicated personal life, and her marriage to Barenboim, who is now music director at the Berlin State Opera, has been a source of public fascination, as well as the inspiration for biographers and dramatists, partly in the light of her final tragic struggle with illness. She first felt symptoms of MS in her fingers at the age of 26. Margolyes’ account suggests Branch acted believing “it was the highest mark of love for Jacqueline that she could show, to release her from the horrors of her illness” and that she sought reassurance from the cellist at the last that she still wanted to die. But one of Du Pré’s surviving companions, Cynthia Friend, 81, told the Daily Mail that she does not credit the story. “I don’t believe it for one minute,” she said. At the end, Friend testifies, Du Pré was too ill to speak or hold her head up properly and was never left alone by her nurse or other friends. “I cannot imagine what Jackie would say, if she heard these things,” she said. Du Pré’s death certificate shows the cause of death as “bronchopneumonia and multiple sclerosis”. Margolyes told the Observer that her publishers, John Murray, were unsure whether to include the incident: “But it was an amazing story that she told. Do you think people are going to pick it up in the newspapers or something?”"
"Whether in the solidarity movement in London in the 1980s, as an academic at the University of Namibia in the 1990s, or as director of the Museums Association of Namibia thereafter, my friend Jeremy Silvester, who has died of Covid-19 aged 58, was a builder. He built communities, he built projects, he built up the young, and he built movements and momentum, often out of nothing. Born in Exmouth, Devon, to Donald Silvester, a civil engineer, and Eleanor (nee Richards), Jeremy attended Blundell’s school in Tiverton and studied history at Cardiff University, then took a master’s in southern African studies at York University and a PhD in African history at the School of Oriental and African Studies. While a student in 1980s London, living in Brixton, he combined research on the marginalised history of southern Namibia with an ardent activism, gaining direct experience of police brutality during protests against Thatcher’s poll tax. This pattern of joint academic and activist work continued. Jeremy and I met initially through Namibia Support Committee activities and social gatherings.  From 1994 he taught at the University of the West of England, then at Bristol University, before moving in 1997 to take up a post as history lecturer at the University of Namibia. In the 1990s Jeremy gave the Trees Never Meet collaborative research project its name, from a proverb that signifies people will always connect – he and I both worked on the project, which brought together new PhD studies from a dozen young scholars.  Many other collaborations followed: on photographic archives, public history, museums, and Namibia’s history of resistance. In a fractured country that suffered two periods of colonialism and a genocide, Jeremy believed that archives, photographs and cultural objects could activate people into connecting with their history and open up routes to justice. He engaged the public outside churches, in shopping malls and in newspaper columns to trigger community responses that began dialogue, and resulted in articles, exhibitions and ultimately new community museums across Namibia. He mobilised many students to do the same work, greatly increasing public debate and participation in political life. Under his leadership from 2005, the Museums Association of Namibia team intervened in international debates on cultural restitution, and began to redefine the African museum. For decades Jeremy combed the former colonial world and mapped the scattered traces of Namibia’s history. His aim was to return them to the country he loved. Jeremy believed that love could overcome the hatred in the world. He always saw the positive, never the negative, and it was underpinned by a wry sense of humour. When opportunity allowed (not often, owing to his enormous workload), he enjoyed hiking, and a memorable destination was the Fish River Canyon. He loved his world travels. He is survived by his partner, Justina Ashipala, and their daughters, Afrika and Asia, by his daughter Shelley, from an earlier relationship, with Cornelia Shiimi, and by his sister, Rose."
"Amy Winehouse’s second album wasn’t exactly in need of a sales boost, and her tabloid ubiquity meant an award win would barely have registered with the general public, but her second album was leagues ahead of winners the Klaxons’ flimsy Myths of the Near Future. Her performance of modern standard Love is a Losing Game at the 2007 ceremony also should have swayed it. Soft and supple as Sade, Ware’s expertly refined debut album is a masterclass in mood-setting. Even when she aims for blown-out X Factor ballad territory on Wildest Moments, it still manages to feel restrained, as if she’s singing directly to the listener. Balancing sonic playfulness with melodic pizazz is tricky to pull off – just ask that year’s inexplicable winners Alt-J. Professional students Gomez swiped the gong from that year’s favourites the Verve, but it should have gone to Massive Attack’s inky third album. Musically, it sought to steer the band away from trip-hop’s creative cul-de-sac, while lyrically it careens headfirst into paranoia and despair, with Teardrop its bleeding black heart. As impressive as winner Sampha’s Process album is, UK rap’s newest superstar was the one who got away. Rooted in grime and hip-hop (50 Cent was an influence) and finessed with nods to Afrobeat and dancehall, Common Sense details the life and times of the then 21-year-old, from the braggadocio to the sobering. Stitching together mementos from her global escapades, MIA never sounded more vital than on her debut. Trying on genres at will – from reggaeton to electroclash, hip-hop and dancehall – its influence spread through pop, cited by everyone from Nelly Furtado to Thom Yorke. A worthy match for the equally trailblazing winner, Antony and the Johnsons. The Prodigy’s second LP was the antithesis of surprise winners M People’s coffee-table soul. Raging against the erosion of rave culture, it unites breakbeat, rave, techno and jungle, the menacing Voodoo People and Poison setting up their next move as parent-scaring superstars. After years guesting on various dubstep crossover hits, Katy B’s debut cemented her status as that genre’s first proper star and showcased a versatile talent. An album about clubbing by someone who’s actually been to a club, it channels UK garage, UK funky, house and R&B into anthems that throb and pulsate. Bedwetters of the world, unite and take over! Coldplay’s debut might be sappy, but it also perfectly captures a specific lovelorn giddiness, all crumpled love notes stuffed in the pockets of bootcut H&M jeans. Shiver, Trouble, Yellow, Don’t Panic, the lovely “secret track” Everything’s Not Lost, are all more emotionally cathartic than Badly Drawn Boy’s winning debut. After years of running away from their success, the luminous In Rainbows marked the point when Thom Yorke et al acquainted their experimental side with their ability to craft heart-swelling alt-rock epics. Their fourth nomination and, staggeringly, their fourth loss (Elbow’s festival-ready The Seldom Seen Kid won), it contains some of their very prettiest moments. No offence to winner Michael Kiwanuka but a weird year needed a weird winner. Created in lockdown with help from fans, How I’m Feeling Now’s bottled-up energy perfectly encapsulated time spent trapped inside (the frantic Anthems opens with the relatable “I’m so bored”), with emotions old and new ricocheting off the walls."
"The year 2021 was meant to be Andrew Coshan’s breakthrough year. The New Zealand-born Australian-trained actor had just scored the lead male role in the Sydney production of Stephen Sondheim’s Merrily We Roll Along. When the Sydney season was finished, he was scheduled to immediately return home to Victoria to start rehearsals for the Melbourne Theatre Company production of As You Like It, cast in the role of Orlando. Yet he remains trapped in Sydney – unemployed, surviving on his savings, and living in a temporary share house where he confesses he has probably outstayed his welcome. “Our first preview (for Merrily We Roll Along) was 24 June, and Sydney went into lockdown the next day,” he says. “Everyone thought it would be for a week or so, so we were kept on contract, I had to stay here. By the time we were officially stood down on 27 July, it was too late to get back.” Coshan is one of dozens of Victorian actors who remain stranded in Sydney with no prospects of employment or retuning home because they were not released from their performing contracts until after the New South Wales/Victoria border was closed. The Media Arts and Entertainment Alliance has interceded on behalf of at least 18 stranded performers, lobbying the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services to grant them exemptions to return home after quarantining for 14 days. The union has also established a petition to pressure the Victorian government, arguing that applications from members to return home have been repeatedly ignored or rejected without reason. Michelle Rae, director of MEAA Equity, said the contractual nature of working in the arts and the incremental way the NSW lockdown began meant Sydney productions initially retained cast members on contract when the Delta variant took hold, in the belief the lockdown would be no longer than one or two weeks. By the time NSW went into extended lockdown, it was too late for interstate performers to return home. “They’re facing months of separation from their families, with no work and some without secure accommodation,” Rae said. “These aren’t tourists wanting to return home. These are contracted freelancers who left their homes for work and remained employees of companies until they were released from their contracts, after the borders closed. The Victorian government must to allow those people to return back to their families and their homes.” Under Victoria’s current travel permit system, only essential workers are allowed to cross the border from NSW. Victorians considered non-essential who had been employed in NSW but subsequently lost their jobs due to the protracted Delta lockdown have remained stranded. While large production houses such as Newtheatricals (Come from Away) and Michael Cassel Group (Hamilton) have continued to pay interstate performers a living away from home allowance, actors such as Coshan contracted by smaller companies are now relying on their savings and government Covid-19 emergency payments, while paying accommodation costs in two cities. Stuck in a city where he knows few people and now facing the prospect of his MTC Shakespearean role being recast, Coshan admits his mental health is suffering. On Thursday he sent his fourth application to the Victorian government, requesting he be allowed to return home on compassionate grounds. Cast member of the hit musical Hamilton, Zelia Kitoko, has applied for an exemption to return home three times. Her mother in Melbourne is seriously ill and Kitoko is her sole registered carer. “There’s no rhyme or reason to the way that the [Victorian] government are processing cases,” she told Guardian Australia. “It’s just such an invalidating experience because even being a citizen with a valid reason for just wanting to get home, you’re being completely ignored.” Come From Away cast member Kathleen Moore, who lives with her husband in Bendigo, remains in a Sydney city apartment building with other cast members. “We got stuck here and it’s no one’s fault,” she says. “But we’ve been trying to get home and it has been a near impossible feat to do. “Thankfully our company [Newtheatricals] has been good enough to keep us on the per diems, to keep us going, but the isolation from family has been very stressful.” Melbourne-based actor Deirdre Khoo arrived in Sydney in May to begin rehearsals for the Darlinghurst Theatre Company’s production of Once. After two weeks of performances the theatre closed. She has since been provided with emergency accommodation by a fellow cast member’s grandparent. Khoo has been rejected for a permit to return home three times and was recently placed on a mental health care plan by a GP due to deteriorating mental health. As with her fellow actors, Khoo was notified by the Victorian government that her applications to return home had been rejected because of the need to protect public health and the principles set out in the Public Health and Wellbeing act and “the relevant human rights” contained in the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities act. “They won’t let us back into the state, but no one is telling us what specifics as individuals we need to meet, or how we were being assessed as individuals,” she says. Guardian Australia has approached the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services for comment."
"When asked when he first attended Notting Hill carnival, Steve Clarke initially has to pause. Before he was born, he answers while laughing, as his mum went to the festivities while pregnant with him. “Carnival is in my blood.” Clarke, 52, grew up in Ladbroke Grove and spent much of his childhood standing on the balcony watching the bombastic procession go past. He joined the parade as a participant in a mas band aged 16. His favourite memory is of when he first put on his costume for the carnival band United Colours of Mas (UCOM), co-founded by Paul O’Donoghue and Richard Gallimore. He felt at home and part of a multicultural family. “Take away carnival and there is a lot of race hate and all that type of stuff going on at the moment. But for those two days, Sunday and Monday, you would never know anything like this existed because everyone just comes together. No matter what race or colour you are, what sex you are. No one sees that at carnivals,” Clarke says. It’s that feeling – of belonging and togetherness – that draws Clarke and many others to the carnival, and it’s what they miss the most now that the street festivities have been cancelled for a second year in a row. Many point to the Black Lives Matter movement and the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on ethnic minorities in explaining why the carnival is a vital cultural event. London’s first carnival was held in 1959 in response to a series of racist attacks and rioting that spread from Nottingham to west London, where white youths targeted black people. The event was put together to celebrate the culture of the local Caribbean community because, according to a brochure handed out during the time, “a people’s art is the genesis of their freedom”. That history of anti-racism and the “freedom for people to express themselves” is just as important now as it was 50 years ago, says the carnival’s executive director, Matthew Phillip. Olaniyi Okunniwa, from Cheltenham, agrees. “The reason why it means so much to me is that it really allows us to say we’re black, we’re British, and here’s what we can bring to British culture.” This year would have been the 22nd carnival he attended, had it not been cancelled. He still plans to make his annual pilgrimage to the capital to see friends. “It’s such an important event. It’s great to have a good time, and people do have a good time, but it does have a very big cultural significance as well.” Samantha Adams, 52, a drama therapist and visiting lecturer in London, says she has been going to the carnival since she was eight or 10. “Why is carnival so pivotal to the black Caribbean experience particularly and much wider? I think it was always a sense of home,” she says. “My parents have always talked about home as a place that they were born in and coming to England was really considered to be a temporary thing. So we grew up with this notion that at some point my parents and possibly us, we’re going to go home. I guess my strongest remaining memory about it was how we were able to picture home.” The carnival allowed her to imagine what the different Caribbean islands were like and connect more deeply to St Vincent, where her parents are from. She describes attending the carnival in her formative years, as she grew up in Southampton, as “profound and really moving”. “And then getting to London where you suddenly were in a majority at Notting Hill carnival for that day. It was always a reminder. It was always a lesson. It was a connection to the Caribbean and my family.” Pearl Boatswain, a 62-year-old legal secretary and DJ, has been going to the carnival since she was a small child. Drawn to the sound systems and booming music, she amassed an impressive collection of music. Ten years ago she was asked to do a short DJ set at a party, and she hasn’t stopped performing ever since. “The guys are always surprised by the kind of music that I play. You’d walk into a venue and they’re looking at you thinking: you can’t be the DJ. You start to play and they’re just standing there with their mouths open.” That, in essence, is what the carnival is about for her: good music and being true to who you are. “I never thought I’d be doing that sort of thing in this time of my life. But what I’m finding is that so many people are so appreciative of what I do.” For most, Notting Hill carnival is an event that takes place over two days, but for Clarke, who is the band leader of UCOM, it’s something he works on all year round. They get to work on the band’s costumes days after the carnival ends and showcase them in December. The rest of the year is spent preparing. It’s hard work, but he loves being part of it. “We don’t get a break, but that’s the love of carnival. Our heart is fed into it so much that it doesn’t bother us not having a weekend to ourselves.”"
"She is one of the last surviving actors of Hollywood’s ”golden age”. Now Dame Joan Collins has given the BBC unprecedented access to her private home movies for a forthcoming documentary. Dating back decades, the footage features some of the biggest names of the silver screen, from Sammy Davis Jr to Paul Newman, who can be seen relaxing beyond the gaze of their fans and studio cameras. Clare Beavan, the documentary’s award-winning director, has been taken aback by the sheer scale of material – about 20 hours of footage within box after box filled with reels. It is a glimpse through the keyhole into a life of star-studded glamour. Other famous names include actors Roger Moore, Tony Curtis, and the former Beatle Ringo Starr. Beavan told the Guardian: “They’re like our home movies – except that it has loads of famous people in rather than kids and your neighbours in the background. We’d have our ugly relatives – and she has film stars … “The home videos are a revelation … Her second husband, Anthony Newley … started the thing off [in the 1960s]. They were covering everything on high-end … film. So you really get a sense of her. I can’t say it’s … completely natural, because you never know with Joan. But you definitely get her off-camera.” The BBC Arts documentary, to be announced on Wednesday, focuses on the life of Collins as a Hollywood legend. She narrates her own “rollercoaster life story”, all with her inimitable wit, Beavan said. “It’s a post-Covid feel-good film because of Joan Collins’s life, which is one hell of a giddy ride.” Collins, 88, who was born and raised in London, became a global television phenomenon as the scheming seductress Alexis Carrington in the 1980s TV soap opera Dynasty. Her father, a successful agent, had strongly discouraged her from becoming an actor, warning her that she would be “washed up by 23”. But Collins enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and was soon signed to an exclusive film contract by the J Arthur Rank Organisation. Beavan said: “Little did [she] know she’d end up working with James Mason, Joan Fontaine or Richard Burton. She tells a good story about Richard Burton, about how he came on to her. She was fighting them off … She had to fight off heads of the studio. It was like #MeToo before #MeToo.” She added: “She had an equal pay battle, albeit for millions on Dynasty, a fabulous humdinger over John Forsyth being paid more than her, when she was the one that almost singlehandedly got Dynasty … to the number one show in the whole world. And she did Playboy at 50 as a feminist gesture, she says.” Beavan’s awards include an Emmy for her documentary on the sculptor and architect Bernini and a Grierson for her adaptation of the memoir The Prince, the Showgirl and Me. Her 90-minute Collins feature is yet to be finished. She is still wading through the home movies, silent footage that includes Collins jumping into a pool, lying on sun loungers and playing with her children, enjoying one fabulous holiday after another, from Greece to Acapulco. “The weird thing is she was always looks stunningly camera-ready … She doesn’t have the Hollywood lighting, but she somehow looks spectacular.” Collins told the Guardian: “I’m delighted to have collaborated on this wonderful in-depth documentary feature film on my life.”"
"YouTube comments are frequently not very nice (or, to use another Guardian writer’s words, are “an infamously troll-ridden wild west of abuse, ignorance and spam”). Something about a cursor blinking in a blank comment box just brings out a certain side of human nature (the bad one). Except, for some reason, if it’s below an ASMR video, where it appears to invite a more or less pure stream of all that is tender in the human heart. These are videos made to provoke one’s autonomous sensory meridian response – AKA “a tingly feeling” – through soothing sounds and visuals that range from the banal to the extremely obscure. There’s a lot of roleplay, and a strong focus on being taken care of (and, increasingly, colourful slime). “ASMRtists” might (pretend to) cut your hair; measure you for a suit; give you a medical check-up; help you find a library book; welcome you, a new Santa Claus, to the Christmas Village (I don’t know either); or just potter around, making peaceful noises by opening things and pouring tea. People come to these videos to feel calm and good. So maybe it makes sense that everyone watching them is primed to gently compliment each other. “Who else comes to Maria’s videos for her but also to get cheered up by everyone being super kind in the comments!” a fan of inSPArational ASMR Organic Facial Treatment writes. “Maria” is Maria Viktorovna, Russian-American ASMRtist Gentle Whispering. On YouTube she has 2.1m subscribers, all of whom, apparently, are lovely. In a recent video (Things that Spark Joy) she apologises for not uploading as much content as usual. 2,222 supportive commenters are having none of it. “Don’t ever feel bad for not posting cause you need a break or not posting well thought out videos!!” one writes. “We appreciate all of them regardless of what it is!!!” “Any video from you is a treat, and know we want you to take the time to rest as well!” someone else agrees. “I appreciate you immensely and I wish you all the best,” adds a third. Imagine if the rest of the internet was like this. Imagine if the world was. Maria’s commenters do: “there would be no war,” one writes underneath ~Simple Pleasures~ Soft Spoken Personal Attention. Viktorovna’s commenters are also lovely on other people’s channels (where she routinely directs them – ASMR is very much about supporting others). One night in one of YouTube’s deeper corners, scrolling the offerings of a lesser-known ASMRtist before bed, I saw a message in cheery capitals. “Who’s from GENTLE WHISPERING MARIA? :) we love you Maria.” Believe that it made my day. I like the deep cuts. “Real OGs remember when Maria used to do her eyebrows with a literal pencil,” someone writes below Whispered Makeup during the Rain. I like the mild, terrible jokes. Korean ASMR superstar Latte (AKA Seul Gi Lee, 1.63m YouTube subscribers) uploads a video titled Rescuing You/ASMR Secret Agent. “She’s rescuing us from all the Kidnapping Roleplay ASMR videos,” someone comments. Sixteen thousand people give this the thumbs up. Below Dreams Hotel: Relaxing ASMR Check-In Desk (by popular UK ASMRtist WhispersRed, AKA Emma Smith, 967,000 YouTube subscribers), some wit points out there must be “772,070 people crammed in room 333”. “Now it’s 2 million, that really is overbooking,” another person writes, three years after that. “Social distancing is impossible in this crowd!” another chimes in, a week later. I’m sure if you scroll far enough you can find someone saying something dreary and mean. But as a rule, if you’re minding your own business – just pretending to be a bear at a spa, or watching someone fold some towels – you can be at peace in the knowledge any accidental swiping down will take you only to a safe and pleasant place. No furious non-sequiturs, no snarky debates. Just goodwill, and a lot of joyful punctuation. Perhaps because of this, commenters are very comfortable being vulnerable. People share insecurities, traumas, anxieties, bereavements. No one seems to find it incongruous. Everyone is scrupulously polite (probably because they have all watched Dinner Etiquette/Soft Spoken/Gentle Proper Eating/Crinkly Shirt). “You help me a lot to distract myself from my inner demons and I wish everybody who reads this comment a healthy and happy night,” someone writes under Smith’s Taking Your Picture, Dressing you, Clicks, Camera & Jewellery. “I honestly cried because I really needed those words of encouragement,” someone writes underneath Viktorovna’s Eyebrow Mapping. Viktorovna’s husband, Darryl (he of Color Analysis: Soft Spokenish, whom she met through ASMR comment threads) has said the community functions something like a support group in precarious moments. Smith told the Guardian in 2018 that “ASMR is more about kindness and love than it is about selling things”. But the genre is now a long way from “niche internet interest” – actors do it, musicians do it, episodes of White Lotus do it – and as other YouTubers cotton on to the effectiveness of lovely comments in directing viewers to their own channels and brands, the charm could be wearing off. Still, I like the nocturnal solidarity among the ASMR commenters, between the insomniacs, the people stuck in lockdown, the people missing their mums, the people grappling with worry and shame, the people who like watching colourful slime. “Maria’s comment section is the last corner of goodness on the internet,” someone writes under Cosy Whisper Chat and Coloring. I am tickled by the fact that it exists, of all places, on YouTube."
"In ancient Rome, a large rectangular space known as the forum was the centre of public life. Before the city, it was a marsh. They drained it and made it a meeting place, between the Palatine and Capitoline hills. People did things, built things, engaged in the daily business of speaking to each other. Now, most of it is in ruins. Today, I have the intense honour of contributing to this now long-running column of funniest things on the internet. Before me, many other funny, plugged-in people have added their own monuments to this increasingly crowded public space. These are mine: I consider fan-made Wikipedia pages to be some of the funniest text online. For some reason, these pages exist for almost every cultural product ever created, including the various Donkey Kong video games. There is something about their syntax that maximally activates the humour cortex of my brain. It’s that level of gravitas, that faux academic tone, applied to various kinds of fictional video game ape. Now I’m not saying the below clip is funnier, or even as funny, as anything the original golden age of The Simpsons (seasons two to eight) ever produced. But when you have seen as much Simpsons as I have, you have to find new and daring ways to enjoy it. This may not be funny to people who have not seen, or do not remember the original joke. It may not even be funny to those who do. Let’s find out. I love football. Not just as a sport, but as a social phenomenon. Les Murray famously called it The World Game, and it is so often a nexus for history, geopolitics, culture, and people. Sometimes this expresses itself in the form of the French footballer Olivier Giroud and the American 90s sitcom Alf. When the Guardian put together its interactive of every player at the 2018 World Cup, this is the anecdote they began Giroud’s entry with. I consider it to be some of the most efficiently funny writing ever published. Funny things aren’t relegated simply to well-known tweets, or a viral video – or a French footballer’s fear of an alien that eats cats. They can be an accident, a fleeting moment, an organic interaction observed by you, and only you. This is a celebration of those rare little mushrooms. Hopefully you have your own equivalent. This is a Facebook comment of pure rage that I happened to see in 2017. I put it to you that it’s the funniest reaction anybody can have to the Bachelor, or really any television show. It is inherently funny to express an appreciation for the 2007 Pixar film Ratatouille. Many other people have also noticed this. But it wasn’t always like this. Before the Ratatouille renaissance, before Ratatouille the musical, when TikTok was still a sparkle in Vine’s eye, when Remy was still on the garbage heap of the Disney pile, Billy Eichner flew the flag for the much-maligned gastronomically blessed rodent. And this, I believe, is funnier than everything else combined. I beg you to please read this article before reading my explanation. Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, prevent the dog from barking etc. etc. Click through, read the article then come back. Written by Guardian Australia’s own Warren Murray, “I came to work on an egg” actually has a very reasonable explanation. It is a reference to a long-running series of adverts from the UK Egg Marketing Board. In fact, many people will see and have no problem with the phrase: “I came to work on an egg.” Whether you know that or not, it’s brilliant writing. I did not know the context, and it made me giddy with laughter. “Having come to work on a lightly poached egg … I was shocked to learn that it may already be too late for me,” is an opening line that rivals and beats Proust. The prank is simple: if you call two people and put them on speakerphone to each other, they will be confused. I watched this clip in 2015, thanks to an expertly-headlined Junkee article, and my friend Sam Langford and I created a Facebook group chat (just for us) called 2 Aussie Drongos that we’ve used ever since. (Language warning.) It’s so great when you can read text in an accent: My actual favourite Stevie Jacobs moment is when he is scared by a giant chicken – but Benjamin Law already included that in his 10 funniest things. Instead, please accept when Stevie Jacobs was attacked by a pelican. Which I discovered when James Colley placed it on his list of Australian news bloopers. In year 9, my science teacher rolled down the projector screen that sat above the whiteboard, told us to stop what we were doing, and showed us this. He did not tell us it was a joke. Look Around You is a surrealist parody of old-school science educational videos, written by Robert Popper and Peter Serafinowicz for the BBC in 2003. Kate McCartney has already picked this for her column, and I can’t back it enough. Imagine though, that you are 15 years old, and spend the first two to three minutes thinking it is real. I swear some of us were taking notes. It is a formative and indelible memory for me, as my mind turned in cartwheels, and the slow ripple of confusion and realisation went through the class. It also counts as being “on the internet”, because our teacher showed it to us via YouTube, not the TV, making it perhaps the first viral video I ever saw. An analog precursor to this entire column.

"My whole life is a deep dive into the mysteries of pop culture. I don’t think I’ve seen the surface in years and it’s likely I have a permanent case of the bends. Each of these treasures I’ve unearthed in my life’s mission of pop culture exploration and investigation transcends in some way. Whether it’s capturing the rarest and most authentic moments of verisimilitude or the beauty of unintentional chaos. Each of these examples reflects something pure and holds immense amounts of power. Diesel is a complex figure of 21st century machismo. His deep gravelly barely audible growl, tank-like physique and signature glazed doughnut dome have always been bolstered by a strong undercurrent of deep sensitivity. This vulnerable and deeply ponderous side of Vin has always been hiding in plain sight on his Facebook profile.  Over the last 13 or so years I’ve seen him share bizarre fan art with inspirational quotes attributed to him that feel like Ed Hardy T-shirts, hint towards a long gestating dream project playing the ancient Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca, a sincere video of him emotionally singing along to Rihanna’s Stay (which, featuring an attempted falsetto, might be the most vulnerable thing an action film star has ever done). Yet the video I always go back to is one brimming with pure joy. Diesel dancing to Beyonce’s Drunk in Love in front of a webcam wearing the longest pair of combat shorts and a tank top. The power held in this video extended my life by at least a year. Vin is feeling himself, honey! Reality TV from the UK is really special. It feels so powerfully rude in a way that is in extreme juxtaposition to the perception of their formal culture of manners and the etiquette of sequential cutlery. This montage of introductions for a reality show called Fat Families is the platonic ideal of wild reality TV. A bespectacled man with ungodly confidence and angelic cadence stating his weekly mission of helping families battling with obesity as “about to meet some right jelly-bellied jumbos” while standing in front of a parade of elephants is the stuff of myth and legend. As a resident of “North Porkshire” myself, the rapid succession of insults in a presentational style just absolutely levelled me. A cafe in the heart of Sydney’s Little Italy posted this for R U OK Day 2020. Bellissimo! The multi-talented Cicierega may be most known for the Harry Potter parody Potter Puppet Pals, but his magnum opus is this perfect parody of obsessive YouTube fan videos that mainly act as a catalogue runsheet of collected information while imparting no wisdom. It’s not just the mis-rememberings, or mispronunciations of the characters and events from The Lord of the Rings that sets me off, but just the detail of speaking way too close to the microphone. Though I hate to admit it, for a professional celebrator of cinema the Oscars are important to me culturally. There’s something about the elegantly dressed heights of popular culture experiencing clashes of emotion and ego that transcends time and space. Matthew McConaughey’s best actor acceptance speech, where he declares he is his own hero and his dad is up in heaven in his underwear with a pot of gumbo, lemon meringue pie, a cold can of Miller Lite and he’s dancing, has slowly become a fount of daily inspiration for me. Patty Duke’s acceptance speech for The Miracle Worker in 1962 is the shortest speech in Oscars history. The buildup of her finding out she’s won, the long walk to the stage, the emotion brewing on her face as the orchestra plays a rushed rendition of Hush Little Baby, a moment basking in showbiz glory before she reaches the mic and tearfully squeaks out “thank you” and immediately leaves the stage undercutting every ounce of ceremonial pretension. It’s a magnificent minute-and-a-half of buildup to three seconds of pay off. This Onion headline has been lodged in the most sensitive part of my skull since 2007, when I was but a chubby theatre nerd in high school drama class. At the time I was obsessed with a little Australian film called Macbeth that, despite its modern Melbourne underworld setting, used the original language of the bard himself. I was also performing the monologue from David Mamet’s salesmen drama ​​Glengarry Glen Ross as a man left ranting homeless during the ongoing global financial crisis of the day. This laugh was a wake-up call to the pretension of needing to put that authorial stamp on everything. When this video dropped on YouTube last year it floored me. The only thing I may hold dearer to my heart than cinema is food. Paris Hilton making lasagna from scratch (using jar sauce, tubs of ricotta and boxed pasta sheets as we all make it) is like a document from another planet. She never takes off these little leather fingerless gloves while preparing the food and pours bottled water to wet a paper towel over the sink, while her stunningly cavernous kitchen quickly accumulates emptied packages like a dragon collecting gold. For nearly a year I waited for a follow-up episode to no avail, until just this month Netflix released an entire season of Cooking with Paris. The documentary feature film The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, about the continuing battle between good and evil through the world of competitive arcade video gaming, is one of the most formative texts I encountered in my teen years. I was starting to get interested in pursuing comedy but seeing comedy happen naturally because a film-maker happened to be pointing a camera at it, and then constructing it in the edit after, awoke this notion of documentary factual storytelling in me (without The King of Kong there’d be no Finding Drago/Desperado). This segment featuring an uncharismatic man trying to build hype around a “potential Donkey Kong kill screen coming up” as not a soul listens to him is what I always come back to watch. It’s character comedy unfolding in the real world filled with heartbreak, triumph and disappointment. One diva’s battle against poor event management is a divine miracle of chaos and live television. Watching this has slowly become a Christmas tradition in my household. It’s that juxtaposition of the elite level professionalism of LaBelle’s perseverance, while a teleprompter fails, she calls for her background singers to support her, in between god-level ad libs to maintain whatever sense of cohesion she can. The twist, that this isn’t just some rinky-dink town’s Christmas celebration, but a ceremony attended by the sitting president, Bill Clinton, and his first lady, Hillary, is the only gift you’ll ever need to bring you merriment this yuletide."
"More than 15,000 people swarmed Nevada’s Black Rock Desert over the weekend for what was dubbed a “renegade” Burning Man, drawing celebrity guests and causing a headache for local law enforcement. The famous festival was cancelled for the second year running due to Covid-19, but that hasn’t stopped revellers from gathering to celebrate the annual event. This year’s party was unofficial and held without any formal organization, and while a fraction of its normal size, it still managed to draw big crowds and famous faces including Diplo and Paris Hilton. Local police told the Reno Gazette-Journal that people were packed “in a small space in the heat, no shade or cooling other than nighttime” and had “little respect” for their “fellow man”. Jerry Allen, the Pershing county sheriff, told the newspaper that one man was transported to the hospital after he fell from a height of 50ft while parasailing, and that there had been three arrests during the unauthorized festival. “It remains to be seen if they will still practice their ‘leave no trace’ mantra, with no organization to enforce that,” Allen said. The sheriff has in the past promised to crack down on the festival, the newspaper reported, saying that “Burning Man brings nothing to Pershing county except for heartache.” In 2019, the last year the festival was held, law enforcement officials arrested at least 58 people at the event, 14 more than the prior year. One man died in his car from carbon monoxide poisoning. Burning Man organizers announced in April they would cancel the festival for the second year because of the Covid pandemic. “We know the need for community has never been stronger. And building community is what Burners do best. We also recognize the pandemic is not over,” said Marian Goodell, the Burning Man CEO, said. “We have decided to focus our energy on building Black Rock City 2022.” The summer of 2020 also saw rogue Burning Man events after the festival was cancelled. Organizers had planned a virtual Burning Man festival, but an estimated 5,000 people still flocked to the Nevada desert. And back in San Francisco, the birthplace of the original Burning Man in the 1980s, more than 1,000 people crowded on to Ocean Beach to celebrate the event, prompting outrage from the mayor who called the gathering “reckless and selfish”. The counter-culture festival has been held for 35 years and typically draws about 80,000 people for a multi-day event on the playa, which culminates in the burning of a large wooden effigy. In recent years, it has become increasingly popular for celebrities and the tech industry elite, and organizers have called for “cultural course correcting”, including ousting some high-profile, and controversial camping groups."
"Samantha Bee tore into the new abortion law in Texas, the most restrictive in the nation, on Wednesday evening – a week after the supreme court, in a midnight 5-4 decision, refused to block the measure which bars abortion after six weeks, before many women know they’re pregnant. “The Texas law circumvents Roe v Wade and, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted in her dissent, is flagrantly unconstitutional,” the Full Frontal host said. “While the supreme court’s anti-pussy posse claimed they were ‘declining to block’ the Texas law on procedural grounds,” Bee continued, “this was just the latest partisan abuse of the court’s shadow docket,” emergency decisions made hastily – in this case, with just three days of consideration – without oral arguments. The court’s majority decision in this case was unsigned, and just a paragraph long. “One paragraph, and unsigned? You fucking cowards,” Bee fumed. “If you’re taking away our reproductive rights, at least own that you’re gutless monsters.” The measure bars public officials from enforcing the law, but encourages private citizens to sue anyone who assists a woman in receiving an abortion – doctors, clinic staff, Uber drivers – and promises to provide $10,000 in reward for a victorious case. “Although you know people are gonna be pissed when that money only comes in Jesus bucks,” Bee joked. “You can only use them at Hobby Lobby, and even then, they’re only good for pipe cleaners and long sticks.” “But Texas lawmakers aren’t just doing this shit for funsies,” she added. “They’re strategically trying to prevent the law from being challenged,” as the measure dodges constitutionality challenges through the doctrine of “sovereign immunity,” which allows people to sue states only if they’re targeting an official who enforces a law. “God, can you imagine if any of these useless twats put as much creativity and time into helping the millions of American children who have no secure home or food?” Bee wondered. “As soul-crushing as it is to see how worthless our supreme court has become, it’s hard not to want to walk right into our rapidly rising oceans and never return,” Bee concluded, pointing to organizations like the Lilith Fund, Texas Equal Access Fund, and the Afiya Center fighting back in Texas. “We need to fight this oppressive law and all the others that come after it, because no person should be forced to give birth.” “These days, you don’t have to look very far for bad news,” said Seth Meyers on Wednesday’s Late Night. “Here in New York City, the destruction from Hurricane Ida was so bad, there were practically rivers flowing into people’s homes and cars floating in 5ft of water. The flooding was so bad the subway looked like a whitewater rapid.” “It’s undeniable, as it has been for a long time, that climate change is intensifying,” he continued. “Much of the [western US] has been on fire this summer, wildfire has drifted all across the country and made the air toxic on the east coast, and New York City just had to declare its first ever flash flood emergency. It’s getting so bad that Pizza Rat has taken up water ballet.” Meyers also touched on the Texas abortion law, upheld by the supreme court in a last-minute, midnight decision. “That’s right, they did it in the dead of the night, in a little more than a page, in the same way a rich kid half-asses a freshman English paper because he knows he can’t fail out,” Meyers said. “They gutted a woman’s right to choose in Texas, and who knows where else next, despite never commanding majority support from the American people, and they don’t give a fuck because they’re there for life,” he continued. “I mean, if that’s how our government is going to work, then why not have a fucking monarchy? At least then we’d have more messy tabloid drama and a Netflix show called The Gavel where the men get played by actors who are way better looking than the actual royals.” “There’s a new [coronavirus] variant in town, and it’s called Mu,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show. The variant, found in 167 people in LA county, is named after the 12th letter of the Greek alphabet, “and not, as I thought, for the Pokemon Mu,” said Colbert. “Either way, gotta get vaccinated, or you’ll catch ’em all.” Last week, the World Health Organization deemed Mu a “variant of interest”. “OK, in the PR world, that’s what we call ‘buzz,’’ Colbert joked. “A ‘variant of interest’ is less dire than ‘variant of concern,’ which is how Delta is categorized. The rating system goes, ‘variant of interest,’ ‘variant of concern,’ ‘variant of pants-crapping’ sometimes called ‘code brown,’ and finally ‘variant of is there any more room on Jeff Bezos’s penis rocket to escape the planet?’” The WHO said in a press release that the vaccines may not work against Mu, as the variant has properties to evade immune responses caused by a “constellation of mutations” – “a constellation also known as The Big Downer,” Colbert quipped. “But there is some good-ish news out there,” he continued, as 75% of US adults have taken at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, “meaning this life-saving vaccine is just slightly more popular than me shaving off my mustache.”"
"The Science Museum has said it will take down a placard created by a student for the school climate strikes after an appeal to remove it from an exhibition sponsored by Shell. In an open letter sent to the museum, the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN) called for the placards to never be used in any “fossil fuel-sponsored” space again, saying the inclusion in the Our Future Planet exhibition was an attempt to greenwash and legitimise the oil company. The letter states that the protesters who created the work were highlighting “the exploitation and destruction caused by fossil fuel companies” and that the museum failed to inform the students their placards would be used in an exhibition sponsored by Shell. “We question why the Science Museum felt it was appropriate to display placards from these protests in an exhibition sponsored by Shell, one of the corporations the climate strikes were fighting against,” it states. Bella May, 20, a student at the University of Reading, said she was approached by representatives from the museum while attending a protest near Parliament Square in central London. She says she gave her placard, which featured an image of the Earth as a melting ice-cream cone alongside the words “Keep It Cool”, to a Science Museum representative with the understanding it would be retained in its collection. May says she was stunned when the UKSCN contacted her on Twitter to inform her it had been used in the Shell-sponsored exhibition. “I was shocked and a bit let down because I thought I was being involved in something helpful and beneficial for people,” said May. In a statement, the Science Museum Group said that it acquired several signs for the national collection after a protest in March 2019 and the items were collected by curators in a “professional and sensitive” manner. “Having today been alerted to the strong feelings of a donor, and in light of all the circumstances around this request, we have decided to remove this item from display and are contacting the donor directly,” it added. The Science Museum did not confirm whether it would not use the other placards it collected in future events sponsored by fossil fuel companies. The UKSCN’s Izzy Warren said the Science Museum was increasingly becoming an “outlier” on the issue of oil sponsorship, after it was revealed that its director, Sir Ian Blatchford, was actively seeking funding from fossil fuel companies at a time when many institutions are distancing themselves from such partnerships. She said: “Anything else that the museum says about wanting to become carbon neutral or wanting to educate the public, that is redundant and irrelevant as long as they’re still providing these oil companies with the social licence to operate.” In July, Channel 4 News revealed that the Science Museum had signed a “gagging clause” which prevented the institution from “damaging the goodwill or reputation” of Shell. Earlier in the summer protesters who had occupied the Shell-sponsored exhibition were removed by police. Similar protests had taken place at the British Museum and Tate Modern after they produced exhibitions sponsored by oil companies, and while those were left to play out, the protesters at the Science Museum were removed. In April, after the school climate strikers called for a boycott of the exhibition, Shell released a statement saying it had a longstanding relationship with the Science Museum “based on a shared interest in promoting engagement in science – which will be a key enabler in addressing the challenge to provide more and cleaner energy solutions”. The UKSCN is also demanding that the placards be removed from the Science Museum and installed in the Climate Museum UK, the mobile and digital museum that collects responses to the climate emergency."
"I had been out of signal for most of the day, so when my phone suddenly stirred in my pocket, I decided to have a look. Remembering a climbing maxim – “Don’t try to do two things at once” – I shouted for my friend Kingsley to hang on, stopped and took out my mobile. The message was junk, but I took the opportunity to send some that weren’t and then check my voicemail. Wandering absent-mindedly to where a boulder jutted off into the mist, I noticed Kingsley moving down the path. Shouting to alert him that I’d stopped, I brought the handset up to my ear and looked out at the cloud hanging off the Cuillin Ridge, waiting for the phone to connect. I took another step, just a small one to the left. And then everything went wrong. As my left foot made contact with the rock, it flew out from beneath me. My leg swung up, pivoting the other away from the ground. For a split second I was airborne. My right arm flew back, hit the rock and, as my full weight followed, I felt something snap in my shoulder – a fibrous crack. I landed on my back, hard, and immediately began to slide. I realised I was moving towards the drop and couldn’t stop. In a career spent walking in and writing about mountains, you do sometimes wonder what you would do if you fell. I lost a friend that way, so thinking about it is unavoidable. Would I scream? Would I go down with stoic acceptance – or flail and shriek, full of anger or fear? Nobody wants to find out. Of course, if you had the luxury of time, eventually your feelings might stop being about yourself and instead focus on those you were going to let down because of this selfishly dangerous activity. But nobody does that. When it happens, thinking is replaced by instinct, reflex and panic. I screamed. I couldn’t help it. Once when my arm hit the ground, then again as I started to fall and the rock bit through my pack and trousers. My jacket tore with a sound like parting Velcro. A single thought: Legs down, keep your legs down, don’t tip forward because your arm is bust. Then three words that still make me feel sick: Here it comes. I slammed into the ground at the foot of the boulders, hard on my back. My pack compressed beneath me and pitched me on to my side, like a rebounding tyre. I gasped for breath with a loud croak. I’d been winded, badly. I saw my glasses land nearby. Then a cascade of white fluff began descending around me like snowfall. I realised my down vest, which I’d been wearing over my jacket for warmth, had shredded and spilled its contents on the way down. I was alive. I was conscious. Almost reflexively, I leaped up and staggered a few steps, clutching my right arm with a sick fear in my gut. My legs worked. My back worked. I could move my neck. Then – like someone turning the volume up on a stereo – the pain hit. I fell into a crouch and yelled for Kingsley. The first shout was meek. I couldn’t gather enough air to push out the words. I gasped, tried again, and finally my voice rang out. “Kingsley! Help!”  I’d fallen about 50ft. A steep diagonal across the middle was where I must have bounced – a loss of momentum that could have saved my life. But I was hurt in a way I knew was serious. My right shoulder was dislocated, bone grinding against tendon and nerve. Mess with that and you risk turning a bad and very painful injury into a life-threatening emergency. And you don’t want an emergency in a place like this. I knew all of this because I’d dislocated my shoulder before. All I needed was someone to put it back in and the pain would lessen enough for me to be able to move about, to get down. Before, I’d been in a city and it had been bad enough. Now I was halfway up the Cuillin Ridge on Skye, the most formidable and treacherous mountain range in Britain. More worrying still, there was another pain in there, a sharper, deeper one down my arm.  Suddenly Kingsley appeared. His expression changed from quizzical to slightly shocked. “Oh, I thought you were having me on. I heard you shout. What happened?” “I fell. I’ve dislocated my shoulder.” He looked up. “Fell from up there?” He shrugged. “Well, it definitely could have been worse.” Gamely, he started to fuss, loosening my rucksack and helping me slide it off. I yelped with pain. “Do you think you can stand?” I was starting to chitter with cold or shock. “Let’s try.” He bent over to help and, as I pushed up, the pain sliced into my right side and I slumped back down, stars flashing against clamped eyelids. I could taste something metallic, nasty. Kingsley’s expression changed. “Are you going to be able to get down?” It was 3km to the car, through a steep, rock-choked valley. Nothing as a distance normally, but I couldn’t even stand. Above us, the cloud covering the top of the buttress of Sròn na Cìche was starting to turn a weak bronze. Soon it would be getting dark. We had only packed for a quick jaunt. We didn’t have enough for a night out, nothing in the way of painkillers, and we’d eaten our meagre food. By now, I was shaking, light-headed, breathing quickly and sharply. “Do you have a signal on your phone?” I asked. He pulled it from his pocket. “No.” “Mine’s over there somewhere, I think. Probably broken.” He rooted around among the rocks and found it. “Case is cracked, but phone intact. You have a signal.” I hesitated, as if pausing would improve things. Dark was creeping up from the valley as light was leaving the sky. I didn’t want to do this. But honestly – who was I kidding? “Call 999. Ask for Skye Mountain Rescue.” It took 10 tries. Each time an operator would pick up, then connect us to the local police, as was protocol. Often a different voice each call. Then, just as some critical piece of information was being relayed, the signal would die. At first frustrated, then slightly desperate, Kingsley tried opening with the location – “Just beneath Lochan Coire Làgan” – in the hope they’d build the scenario. When the 10th attempt died mid-sentence, Kingsley swore. “Do you think they’re coming?” I asked. “Christ knows,” he said. “Surely we’ve given them everything they need.” He sat down next to me and patted my knee. Right then, even through the pain, I hated myself. Hated that I couldn’t push through it and be like all those people who had crawled off lethal, ice-covered mountains with broken legs and pneumonia. I could imagine the alert going out to the mountain rescue team. The volunteers might be settling down for family dinners, putting their children to bed. And now they had to trek up into the Cuillin to rescue me, an idiot who clearly hadn’t been paying enough attention to what he was doing. “Do you think I should call them again?” said Kingsley. I hesitated, then nodded. This time the connection held and the operator remembered us. Kingsley put him on speaker. “The mountain rescue team is gathering in Glen Brittle,” he said. “There’s a helicopter on its way.” Helicopter? I shook my head. “I don’t need a helicopter. I just need someone who can put my shoulder back in.” A calm Scottish voice said: “You should take the helicopter. It will get you down a lot quicker. You’ve had a fall.” “But I could walk down if they just did something.” “You’ll need an X-ray. There could be complications. The team will assess you.” Kingsley seemed to have just had several tonnes taken off his shoulders. He patted my knee again. “They’re coming. That’s the important thing.” He pulled out a silver hip flask. “Want some whisky? Cheapest I could find. It’s excellent.” I did. I wanted to down the whole thing. “I don’t know if this shaking thing is cold, or shock, or what,” I said. My words were sliding into each other and I was now trembling constantly. Kingsley draped his spare layer over me, pulled mine out of the bag and draped that over too, before jamming his hat on to my head. “Just hang in. They’re coming. But you know, it might get to the point where I’ll have to cuddle you.” Then he stood up and looked about, as if realising where he was for the first time. The light was fading and with it the cloud was changing. He stood for a long moment, taking in the grandeur of the ridge and its seven miles of peaks. “It’s quite …” He paused. “I mean, I can see why. Under different circumstances, it would be …” His voiced trailed off. I watched him look around in weary wonder, hands on hips, as night started to settle on the Cuillin. Some time after that, we heard the deep beat of helicopter rotors in the distance. For a long time, they stayed muffled, then Kingsley said: “I can see it.” We saw its lights rise into view, then start to hunt around. Kingsley found a head torch and began to signal in broad sweeps. I was relieved, but then it became obvious something was wrong. “They can’t land,” Kingsley said. Then, with relief in his voice, he said: “Someone’s coming.” Over the rocks ahead, a light appeared and with it a man wearing a helmet and a red waterproof, carrying a hefty box. Kingsley started talking at a gallop but the man held up his hands. “Gents,” he said, “I just need to catch my breath for a wee second.” Then he leaned in to me, inclining his head to look at my face closely, as if peering through a keyhole. “I’m Andy,” he said. “Can you tell me your name?”"
"Tropical female spiders are the size of a child’s hand, they can eat their puny male relatives for lunch and produce extraordinary golden silk that can be made into textiles like nothing else on the planet. That is the idea. But the execution of such a project was far more complicated. Around 2 million spiders had to be collected from the highlands of Madagascar and their silk harvested over eight years to produce just four textiles. It was, agreed textile designer Simon Peers, a crazy endeavour to embark on in the first place. “Over several hundred years you’ll find strange people who have tried to do this and every time it has been found to be mad,” he said. “I guess we’ve just followed suit and somehow we pushed it a bit further than anyone else has ever done. I hope we have created some beautiful and wonderful things.” Three of the four textiles that Peers and entrepreneur Nicholas Godley helped create are to go on display in the UK at an exhibition of rare and curious objects connected to the natural world. The London show will also include Chinese root sculptures, meteorites and a sapphire inscribed as belonging to King Seleucus (third century BC). But the star exhibits will be the three textiles: two shawls and a lamba – a traditional Madagascan garment – made from the silk of golden orb-weaver spiders. The project involved 15 years of research, which included examining the efforts of people who had attempted similar things in the 18th and 19th centuries. The eight years of production involved a team of 80 men and women being trained and employed to scour the highlands of Madagascar for spiders. They were collected in the morning and harnessed in groups of 24, each placed in an individual compartment with equipment that could thread their silk on to cones. At the end of the day, the spiders were returned unharmed. A golden cape that was produced was exhibited to acclaim at the V&A in 2012. Sir David Attenborough wrote in the catalogue: “It must surely be counted as one of the rarest and most glamorous of fabrics. Thank goodness the world still holds marvels.” Peers said the normally ephemeral silk had a wonderful golden translucence. “We have done nothing to the silk whatsoever; we have literally taken it from the spider. We haven’t had to wash it or dye it or do anything with it except doubling it or tripling it or whatever to make the thread we need.” It has a unique feel to it, Peers said. If you close your eyes and ask someone to put the silk on your hand, “you don’t feel anything, it is quite bizarre. All you feel is the heat from your hand reflected back, you don’t feel the silk. It is almost like an invisibility cloak … it is quite uncanny.” The spider silk has remarkable properties of strength and elasticity, said Peers. “A lot of laboratories are working on trying to replicate the properties of spider silk, but without using the spider, because the results are so extraordinary.” Peers hopes they have managed to create beautiful and rare things that also have an art and poetry to them."
"“As a rebellious preteen, I sat down and made a list of my life goals,” writes Cammie Toloui in her photobook 5 Dollars for 3 Minutes. “It was pretty simple: 1. Sex. 2. Drugs. 3. Rock’n’roll.” Born in the San Francisco Bay Area in the Summer of Love, Toloui was in the right place to hit these targets, and by 1990 was a member of a feminist punk band, Yeastie Girlz, and working at the Lusty Lady strip club. Stripping was part-rebellion and part-necessity because Toloui was studying photojournalism at San Francisco State University and the Lusty Lady paid well, but when she was given an assignment to shoot her own life, it also became a project. Deciding not to photograph herself or her colleagues, because female nudes have been seen so many times before, she trained her camera on the customers. “I was really excited by the tradition of photojournalists, who step into any situation and bravely take the picture that needs to be taken, rather than the picture that is easier,” she says. “And being the punk kind of woman I was, it seemed like I had to do that. I felt like this needed to be seen, because while we all know about the sex industry, and we all know about pornography, we only know it from the man’s view of the women. Actually, originally, I asked a friend to come along [as a customer] so I could take a photograph of what it looked like, but he didn’t show. So I had to be brave and ask an actual customer [if I could photograph him].” To her surprise, the customer – the word Toloui prefers to use rather than client – said yes, and even came back for more the following week, so what started as an assignment turned into something she worked on for two and a half years. Toloui’s time at the Lusty Lady was divided between the stage, a mirrored peep show in which she danced with other women, and the Private Pleasures booth, in which she was alone and performed for one viewer or a group; in both cases the viewers were behind glass, but in the booth she and they were connected via microphone. Toloui started to take her camera into the booth regularly and ask customers if she could shoot them in return for a free show, and while many refused, a few agreed, some covering their faces, perhaps more interested in the bargain, but others adopting extravagant poses. Either way, they were willing participants, says Toloui, adding: “It was consensual – it wasn’t me sneaking photos.” She managed to shoot about 100 usable images, most of which are published in 5 Dollars for 3 Minutes. Some of the photographs capture small groups or heterosexual couples, but most show men on their own, framed by the same pane of glass but of various ages, ethnicities and body types. Some wear suits and some casual clothes, others are half-naked or completely undressed; Toloui wanted to capture them aroused, so many have erections that are visible or even displayed. Others show more esoteric predilections, partly as a result of Toloui’s open-minded approach to sex work. She was happy to take punters that made other Lusty Ladies uncomfortable, she says, taking an anthropological interest in the panoply of male desires that unfolded. “When I got those guys who had more unusual kinks, I would encourage them to be themselves, and they could feel that I wasn’t judging them, that I welcomed their peculiarities,” she says. “Then they would come back, so I started getting regulars. I became known as that one who didn’t mind. “I had this feeling I was helping the men who needed to not feel like there was something wrong with them,” she adds. “They needed to feel like ‘OK there’s someone who’s open to my kink. Here’s someone who lets me be who I am,’ because, for whatever reason, they had been made to feel guilt or shame about whatever it was. There was a cop who loved lingerie, for example; he would wear it under his uniform, and when he got a new outfit he’d come in and show me.” Another regular brought along dated 1970s clothes for her to wear, complete with holes to expose her breasts and groin; Toloui says the outfit transformed her into a hilarious “soccer mom”, but she loved the fact “he could trust me enough to show me what he truly wanted”. But she adds that she couldn’t laugh in front of him, though she wanted to, and that this story is revealing because it shows how she had to conform to her customers’ desires. At the Lusty Lady she worked under an assumed name, hid her bleach-blond dreadlocks under a wig, and wore outfits far from her usual attire; she says she’s a sex-positive feminist, who believes “women should have the right to do whatever it is they want to do with their bodies, including sex work”, but she adds that this work was framed by the patriarchy. “What it comes down to is the money,” she says. “In the end, you just really need to pay your rent. And the men have the money, so you do what you need to do to get them to part with it. When you get into sex work you have to suppress your true self, in order to make money from someone who has certain expectations of how you should be. What’s normally expected is that you erase yourself, or cover up your true self, to make yourself attractive to a man to masturbate over you.” Toloui left the club in the early 1990s, bored with stripping and deciding that she’d taken enough photographs. Since then, the last old-school peep show has closed in the US, but strip clubs have become mainstream in the US and beyond, and strip-show aesthetics have emerged in pop culture. Toloui welcomes the greater openness about female sexuality, but questions how far it reaches. “If it’s still within the framework of the typical, patriarchal expectations of beauty and sexual imagery – if it’s still existing within a framework of sex work – it’s still about pleasing men,” she argues. And she’s irritated it’s taken so long for her photographs to be published in full, because, while her images have been exhibited at institutions such as Tate Modern and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, what’s been shown is shots of her, or clothed customers, or the few heterosexual couples in the series (including a pair who were artists, visiting friends working at the Lusty Lady, who squirted breast milk at the screen for a laugh). The images showing men with erections have largely remained unseen. “Curators and editors have chosen the images where there was a woman in the picture because it’s safe,” Toloui says. “We’re used to seeing women in a sexualised context. But it became so frustrating to me that they wouldn’t show the real work, which is men jerking off. That is the majority of the work.” It’s taken nearly 30 years and an up-and-coming photobook specialist, the Athens-based Void, to finally publish the whole thing; for Toloui, that reflects a greater contemporary openness about sex work and female sexuality, but also the fact there are now more female artists, editors and curators, “so it’s not only men who can make the decision about what can be seen”. Even so, she says there’s more to be done in showing the female gaze and male sexuality, and adds that doing so will also help men. If the patriarchy sets out certain roles for women, it also does the same for men, she points out; for some of her customers, the Lusty Lady was the only place they could let that mask slip. It was the only place, perhaps, they could show their real desires, the lingerie under the uniform. “These men aren’t pretending,” she says. “That’s who they are and how they’re feeling in the moment, and that made them vulnerable … All those things you see every day, men having to peacock, to bulk up, or walk tall, or talk tough, that’s such a burden for someone who isn’t like that. But men being allowed to be something other than the masculine ideal? That revolution has yet to happen.”"
"I typically heard two reactions from people who watched The White Lotus this summer: one, that they were obsessed with the HBO show, a breakout hit about a cursed week at a Hawaiian resort. Two, that they were terrified of Olivia, the perpetually unimpressed, bucket hat-wearing dispenser of razor-sharp Gen Z judgment, played with deadpan cruelty by Sydney Sweeney. In a few short years, the actor, who turns 24 on 12 September, has earned a reputation for portraying young adult characters masking deep wells of emotion with cool detachment, from The White Lotus, to Amy Adams’ roommate at a psychiatric facility in HBO’s Sharp Objects, to another breakout HBO show, Euphoria. I’m pleased to report that Sweeney, in an interview, is nothing like Olivia (“I was absolutely terrified of Olivia as well,” she says), nor Cassie, the sensitive but dispassionate high schooler she plays on Euphoria. Over the phone, she’s quick to laugh, breezy on the details of her new erotic thriller, Amazon’s The Voyeurs, and quick to emphasize the gulf between herself and her characters. “It’s so strange, I watch my projects, and I don’t remember filming – that’s how separate I am from what I’m doing,” she told the Guardian. Unlike the numerous young stars who came up through the Disney or Nickelodeon pipelines, Sweeney has not had to renegotiate her public image with difficult, adult material. Euphoria, which premiered in 2019 and whose much-anticipated second season is due early next year, drew headlines, and viewers, for its gritty and often graphic portrayal of modern teenage life – drugs and alcohol, sex, sexting and the titillations and violations therein. As Cassie, Sweeney appeared topless in the first episode; a major plot point was the leak of Cassie’s nude photos and subsequent judgment by her peers. In The Voyeurs, written and directed by Michael Mohan (with whom she worked with on the Netflix series Everything Sucks!), Sweeney plays Pippa, a twentysomething who moves with her boyfriend, Thomas (Justice Smith) into a Montreal apartment with an expansive view of the young, attractive couple across the street. Glimpses of the couple’s sex life slip into watching and, for Pippa, into obsession; though the film takes a hairpin turn in its final half-hour, it’s not a spoiler to say that, as an erotic thriller in the mostly erstwhile lane of Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction, The Voyeurs requires a certain level of nudity, and extended sex scenes, from Sweeney. The prospect of nudity on-screen is not in itself daunting – “I always look at a script and make sure that it’s not just getting thrown in there to be in there,” she said. “What I loved particularly about this scene is that it was more for the female’s pleasure instead of for the male pleasure.” Thanks to an intimacy coordinator on set, a position that has flourished in the #MeToo movement, Sweeney “never felt bad in any sense” during filming of tightly choreographed romantic scenes. “It was all very thought out and considerate.” Sweeney, whose first main role was in Everything Sucks! in 2018, evinces the shift in industry standards around intimacy in the few years since the 2017 Weinstein reports, which cast a harsh light on Hollywood’s disregard for female performers and crew. She’s worked with an intimacy coordinator on every project, “so I have been very lucky to not have experience anything bad,” she said. “Hopefully we can start getting more intimacy coordinators on every set so that every actor can feel comfortable and safe telling these stories.” The more intimidating aspect is potential for screengrabs and memes to blast across social media – a violation that already occurred with nude images of Cassie on Euphoria. “To be honest, after Euphoria, I had to stop caring or thinking about [screengrabs], because the tiny little pictures that were on one of the character’s phones blew up everywhere,” she said. After that experience, Sweeney says she significantly altered her boundaries with social media and practiced disassociation from the images of her characters. “I am very different from my characters, and so when I see those kind of pictures or I get tagged in those kind of pictures – which I think is crazy that they can have nudity on social media that is me and I don’t approve it, but that’s another story – I just separate myself from it,” she said. “It’s like ‘Oh, that’s Cassie. Cassie’s having a good day.’” Social media “used to be a place where I felt very comfortable to be able to kinda just pop on and off whenever I wanted,” where she’d communicate with friends and family, who remain in north Idaho, where she grew up. But Sweeney, who once posted a tearful Instagram live – from her couch, with her dog, watching her preferred channel, HGTV – as evidence of the effect of cruel comments, especially about her looks, says she now approaches it sparingly. Still, “everyone will always say ‘don’t read anything,’ and we’ll say we don’t read anything, but to be honest, of course I do,” she said. “It’s hard not to. I wish that I didn’t, but I’m a person, I’m a human being, I have thoughts and feelings and emotions, and I’m curious to know what people think. “When they’re talking about characters, they’re truly talking about Pippa or Cassie or Olivia, but it’s hard when they turn it to Syd,” she added. “I never actually put Syd out there; no one really knows Syd.” The real Syd is “quite a homebody”, she says, and a voracious reader. Following in the footsteps of such stars-turned-producers of literary IP such as Reese Witherspoon, Margot Robbie and Elizabeth Banks, Sweeney has started a production company, Fifty-Fifty Films, focused on adapting female-led stories in “as many different types of projects possible”. The company is currently filming an HBO Max series, The Player’s Table, based on Jessica Goodman’s novel They Wish They Were Us, starring Sweeney and pop singer Halsey as two best friends who unravel the mystery of a classmate’s murder in an affluent Long Island town. Securing the deal required round after round of pitch meetings – and convincing veterans of the industry to take her and her vision for the project seriously. “I’m always prepared, I know what I’m talking about, and I’ve worked really hard,” she said, and because The Player’s Table ended up at HBO Max, a place where she had existing professional relationships, “I definitely felt like people took me seriously and they listened to me and they respected me. But I’ve definitely been in meetings [in the past] where I’m sitting there and they look at me like I’m a little girl.”” Asked if she received any particular advice on navigating the business from an A-list slate of older co-stars – White Lotus actors Connie Britton, Jennifer Coolidge, Molly Shannon, for example – Sweeney deferred to observing their acting processes. “I don’t think there’s one particular word of advice that has been spoken to me, but it’s more just like watching them all and learning from them.” “Every word of Jennifer Coolidge or Molly Shannon’s mouth is just pure comedy gold,” she added. “I’m like, where is this coming from? How did this come out of your brain so quickly?” Sweeney is two years deep on a bachelor’s degree in business (“with Euphoria’s schedule, it definitely makes it very difficult to finish classes,” she noted), a decision she described in a 2019 MTV interview as a protective measure so that “when I get a contract for $20m I can read that contract myself and not get fucked over”. These days, on the contract front, “I will say life definitely prepares you a lot more for the world, and experience prepares you,” she said. But “school, I think, makes you feel more confident in what you’re doing.” That confidence may emerge in future roles, but for the time being, the “real Syd” remains at a distance from the public. “I’m pretty happy keeping it private for myself,” she said. “It’s a little something that my family gets to hold on to, or my best friends, and it’s a good separation for what I do.” As for Olivia, the aforementioned Zoomer terror of the summer, Sweeney is coy on whether she hopes to appear on a recently announced second season, which will take place at a different White Lotus resort. “I don’t think she would’ve progressed too much,” she said, but “she’s always down for another vacation.”"
"Richard E Grant has revealed his wife of 35 years, Joan Washington, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer eight months before her death. The actor, 64, known for films including Withnail And I and Can You Ever Forgive Me?, announced Washington, a voice coach, died earlier this month, aged 71, by sharing a video of the pair dancing together to Only You by the Platters on Twitter. Writing in the Daily Mail, the Oscar nominee described the impact of losing his wife and their almost four decades together, which he called “the ride of my lifetime”. The couple married in 1986 and share a daughter, Olivia, and a stepson, Tom, from Washington’s previous relationship. “Since her stage four lung cancer diagnosis two days before Christmas, she was accepting, clear sighted, sanguine and totally without self pity,” Grant wrote. “The oncology team at the Royal Marsden hospital, NHS nurses, Price’s Mill Surgery and Longfield palliative carers have been beyond exemplary. “It’s been my privilege to be by your side, sharing our last eight months together, enabling us to say everything we possibly wanted and needed to, so that when you asked Olivia and me two weeks ago ‘to let me go’, we unequivocally said ‘yes’. “Olivia and I are profoundly grateful for everything that you’ve gifted us with, and we’re relieved that you no longer have to struggle for breath.” The love of his wife was “immeasurable”, her loss “incalculable”, Grant wrote. “It’s an extraordinary phenomenon to be truly ‘seen’ and ‘known’ by another human, and in Joan, I found someone who innately did both. “The depth of our grief is mirrored by the magnitude of our love.Goodbye Monkee-mine. Do not forget us.” Grant also revealed the Prince of Wales came to visit Washington, nicknamed “the Colonel”, shortly before she died. “Prince Charles came to see ‘the Colonel’ last month, sat beside her, took her hand and said: ‘It’s been an absolute honour to have known you, Joan’ to which she instantly quipped: ‘I’m still here.’ Which broke the ice and made all three of us cackle,” he wrote. Washington, from Aberdeen, trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama and began her career as a dialect coach on Barbra Streisand’s 1983 movie Yentl. She subsequently worked as a voice and dialect coach in the film industry for nearly 40 years, training stars including Anne Hathaway, Vanessa Redgrave and Emma Stone."
"Seth Meyers panned California’s process for recall elections on Wednesday evening, a day after the current governor, Gavin Newsom, handily defeated an effort to unseat him by the Republican party. “Recalls in California are, to use a political insider term, super fucked up,” said Meyers. The recall ballot contains only two questions: should California recall its governor, and who should replace them if the recall succeeds? “Which means a sitting governor could get recalled if they get 49% of the vote and then get replaced by someone who got half that,” the Late Night host explained. “It’s insane. “I mean, who came up with this system?” he continued. “It’s more difficult than following the latest developments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.” “The recall system is nuts and it should be scrapped,” he added. “Why is every electoral system in this country so backwards and insane? Gerrymandering, the electoral college, recalls – why can’t there just be a winner who gets the most votes and that’s it? Why is it easier on America’s Got Talent than it is to vote in America? If Doritos chose their flavors this way, the top seller would be Cilantro & Cauliflower.” California’s “dumb, waste-of-time recall” cost taxpayers an estimated $276m and could end up costing more than $300m, “all because Newsom went to dinner during the lockdowns at a fancy restaurant called the French Laundry, which we can all agree was absolutely stupid on his part. “But it’s also not surprising that this was the way Republicans tried to stage a takeover of the most populous state in America,” Meyers added. “Not through a normal election, but through a weird loophole where they would only need a small percentage of voters to win.” “Sorry, California Republicans,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show. “I know you spent 20 months and millions of dollars on this recall, but you know what they say: you win some, but not in California.” Newsom celebrated his non-removal in a speech on Wednesday night: “I want to focus on what we said yes to as a state: we said yes to science, we said yes to vaccines, we said yes to ending this pandemic. We said yes to diversity.” “And nothing says diversity like a rich white guy named Gavin,” Colbert quipped. The Late Show host also discussed the Nicki Minaj tweet that ignited a firestorm online, in which she claimed she wasn’t vaccinated because her cousin’s friend in Trinidad developed swollen testicles from a Covid vaccine. “Of course, your cousin’s friend is a much more trusted source than all of the world’s doctors,” Colbert joked. “That’s why in an emergency you always hear a man yelling, ‘Is anyone here someone’s cousin’s friend?’” Outrage over Minaj’s claims and vaccine skepticism prompted Trinidad and Tobago’s minister of health to respond in a press conference: “There is absolutely no reported such side-effect of … testicular swelling in Trinidad, nor that we know of anywhere else in the world.” “Wait a second, sir, are you calling Nicki Minaj a liar?” Colbert joked. “Because to do that takes some … wait a second.” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed America’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years of war, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. “We just observed the 20th anniversary of 9/11, and what do we say? ‘Never forget,’ which is a powerful and necessary sentiment, and it’s true,” he said, noting memories of observing the attacks from afar as a child in South Africa. “But if I’m honest, I think we need to expand on what ‘never forget’ means. I also feel like we should never forget how easily our fear can drive us to do horrible things to other human beings.” As terrible as the recent US drone strike in Afghanistan that the New York Times reported accidentally killed 10 civilians, including seven children, “what’s even more terrible is that when you look back at the 20 years of the war, there’s absolutely nothing unique about it”. At one point in the war, America and its allies were killing more civilians than the Taliban – a “huge failure on the part of America”, Noah explained. “I mean, if you’re killing more civilians than the Taliban, what’s the point of being there? Like, if you’re trying to catch the Candyman but you’re killing more people than he is, at some point people are just gonna be like, ‘All right, we’re just gonna stick with the Candyman.’ “What makes it worse is that nobody ever seems to face any consequences for these deaths. There’s no other job in the world where you can just accidentally kill innocent people and then show up the next day like nothing happened,” he added, noting the sparse public outcry throughout the war. In fact, the war in Afghanistan was “something most Americans did forget, while it was happening”, he said. “To most people in America, this war became like when you forget Netflix is on, and they have to pop up that little thing like, ‘Yo, are you still alive?’” But the Afghan people did not forget about the war, especially as thousands of innocent people lost loved ones to American drone strikes. And lest Americans forget the financial cost, Noah added, the war cost $300m a day for 20 years. “Forget about schools and hospitals – for $300m a day, America could’ve made a new Fast & Furious movie every day for 20 years,” Noah joked. “The least we can do the next time we even consider getting into another war is to never forget that it might not actually make anybody feel safer, or safer at all,” he concluded. “Never forget that it will cost you a fortune. And most importantly, never forget that there are innocent people on the other side."
"Don Draper has an existential breakdown at a new age healing camp, then closes his eyes, smiles and invents the most famous television commercial of all time. The cynicism is breathtaking. Draper is lost as a person. Everything around him has been destroyed, and he is totally alone in the world. But it’s OK because he’s figured out a way to sell fizzy drinks. Money always wins. In which, after spending a decade and a half as a largely realistic drama about the members of a youth club, the characters suddenly learn that they are fictional characters in a TV show and attempt to write their own fate. After being attacked by a dinosaur, the youth club is rigged with dynamite and destroyed. This is a real thing that actually happened. What makes the Fleabag finale so special is its very last moment. After the trials of the preceding episodes – weddings, miscarriages, love affairs, gins in tins – Fleabag has a moment of realisation. The fourth wall, the thing she has been confiding with since we met her, is holding her back. And so – with a sad, sweet smile – she waves us goodbye. As in It’s a Wonderful Life, an angel comes to Earth to show JR Ewing what things would be like had he never been born. Unlike It’s a Wonderful Life, however, the angel then turns into a glowing-eyed devil who starts screaming about how JR should definitely kill himself. Which, as endings go, is fairly unexpected. Some say that the Breaking Bad finale was too neat: Walter White made his way around his world trying to right the devilish actions of his time as Heisenberg before he died saving his friend. But the episode moved like a sleekly designed machine; a fitting end to one of the best shows of all time. When this quaint little drama ended, the land the sets were built on had to be returned to its normal state. This meant destroying several buildings. And this is why, to save on production costs, the Little House finale ended with the characters blowing up their own homes. Totally inspired. The show that was meant to be like The Simpsons, but with animatronic anthropomorphised dinosaurs, ended with everyone dying. Earl, the Homer-ish dad dino, neglected the environment, brought about an apocalypse and had to spend the final moments of the series explaining to his toddler that they were all about to be killed. This was a kids’ show, remember. A cut to black so abrupt viewers complained to their cable providers. The final sequence builds in quiet dread. A family eat at a diner. Their daughter struggles to park. A man keeps glancing over. What happens to Tony Soprano? Is he murdered? Doomed to spend his life shooting panicky glances at the door? The show’s creator, David Chase, refuses to explain. Hopefully it stays that way. In episode one of Damon Lindelof’s surreal supernatural drama, 2% of the world’s population disappeared. In the final episode, a woman claimed to have answers but described them so diffidently that even she didn’t seem to believe them. That was it. So what happened to the missing? Are they dead? In heaven? Sometimes you just have to let mystery be. Some people say that the Lost finale was bad. Those people are welcome to line up and fight me. The episode ended with most of the castaways leaving the island, to eventually be reunited in a location that existed outside of time and space, in a waiting room for the afterlife. Yes, fine, it looks pretty rubbish written down. But you weren’t there, man."
" Melbourne Theatre Company has become the latest organisation to secure major financial relief from the federal government’s Covid support fund, receiving a $5m grant to keep it afloat. The sum matches last month’s Opera Australia grant, drawn from the $30m so far spent through the $50m Covid-19 arts sustainability fund. More than 160 MTC performances have been cancelled so far this year due to Covid-19 restrictions in Melbourne. Last year, the company lost more than $13m in revenue from lockdowns and is expected to post a $6m loss for 2021. The MTC co-chief executive, Virginia Lovett, said on Monday the grant would help the company weather the ongoing crisis. “Over the past 18 months we have tried to navigate each challenge as best we could but the velocity and frequency of lockdowns and restrictions have impacted every one of our shows and compounded the losses,” she said. “We have drawn down considerably on our reserves, this investment will ensure we are not compromised in future years and continue to be one of Australia’s leading performing arts companies as we welcome in a new era of artistic direction in 2022.” The federal arts minister, Paul Fletcher, said MTC’s sustainability was at risk due to the ongoing pandemic. “No performances means no revenue,” he said. “The MTC is a systemically important arts company, and its situation closely fits the criteria for the sustainability fund.” In June, Sydney Theatre Company secured $2m from the federal government, and late last year $6m from the NSW government. In total, just under $500m has been quarantined for the arts sector since June 2020 by the federal government, with applications for the sustainability fund still open until May 2022 and the film and television’s temporary interruption fund as yet untouched."
"Trevor Noah unveiled a new, restyled Daily Show studio on Monday evening – his first show after a month-long hiatus and first return to the studio since March 2020. The in-studio Daily Show has returned, but vaccination rates in America are still limping along – just 63% of the population 12 and older is fully vaccinated, “and it seems like President Biden is done waiting”, said Noah. Last week, Biden revealed sweeping vaccination mandates for government workers and contractors, and announced all businesses with more than 100 employees must require vaccinations or weekly testing for their workers; failure to comply will result in fines of $14,000 per violation. “My message to unvaccinated Americans is this: what more is there to wait for?” Biden said. “What more do you need to see? We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us.” “Say what you want about Biden, he’s not messing around,” said Noah. “And if you ask me, it’s actually smart of Biden to do this mandate through people’s employers. It’s not the government coming for you, it’s your employer. Because Americans are already used to their employer having a ton of power over their lives. “I mean, think about it: your employer can tell you what to wear, what time you’ve got to be there, when you can leave,” he added. “I mean, they can even put up a sign on the bathroom door that says ‘do not use,’ and then you just gotta not poop. That’s power.” Republicans have denounced the plan, and 19 GOP governors have vowed to defy the measure in their states; Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina promised to “fight them to the gates of hell”. “Normally, that statement is hyperbole, but with Covid you might actually get the chance,” Noah quipped. The outrage shouldn’t come as a surprise, said Noah as “any mandate, no matter how much it seems like common sense to some people, is gonna make other people really mad. And it’s not just the vaccine,” he added, pointing to fury over seatbelt requirements in the 1980s. “Mandates by their nature build resistance,” he concluded. “And if Biden’s gonna be doing that, I hope he is ready for what’s going to happen, because mandates turn ‘I don’t knows’ into ‘fuck you’s.” Biden’s new Covid vaccine mandates have “enraged the lunatic fringe of anti-vaxxers otherwise known as Republican governors”, said Stephen Colbert on Monday evening. Some have even threatened to sue, prompting Biden to respond on Friday: “Have at it.” Colbert broke out his Biden impression: “I went to Scranton School Bus-top Tussling, once gave a man a little elbow music for looking cross-eyed at my Buster Browns. You got a problem with that mandate you can stop by and meet my pals Empathy and Public Service.” In other news, it remains to be seen whether California will recall its Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, pending a referendum on the complex election with 46 opposing candidates. Newsom’s opposition includes businessman John Cox, who has been holding campaign events with a live bear. “All that tells me is that John Cox is so bland even a bear won’t eat him,” said Colbert. Another candidate is Patrick Kilpatrick, an actor who has appeared in such films as Under Siege 2, Free Willy 3, Angel 4 and the TV show Babylon 5. “And if you add all those numbers up, it’s more than the votes Patrick Kilpatrick will get,” said Colbert. According to polls, 60% of California voters oppose the recall – “the other 40% said ‘I am running for governor,’” Colbert joked. And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also tore into GOP opposition to Biden’s new Covid safety plan, from the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, to Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina, who vowed to fight the administration’s vaccination mandates “to the gates of hell”. “Take it easy, Henry, you’re not even going to fight somebody to the gates of your community,” Meyers retorted. “And I’m sorry, you’ll ‘fight them to the gates of hell?’ It’s a requirement to get vaccinated against a deadly respiratory virus and you sound like you’re writing a screenplay for a direct-to-VHS Steven Seagal movie called Strike Force One. “But that’s what these people do!” Meyers continued on Republican blowback. “It’s all performance and manufactured outrage designed to gin up their base. They don’t seem to care about the toll of the virus itself and the immense loss and grief it’s wrought. They just care about mimicking Trump to pander to their voters. “These guys are acting like mandates are tyranny when in reality, mandates exist everywhere, and we have to do all kinds of much more annoying things every day to live a in functional society with other people,” he added. “I mean, you think anyone likes waiting in line at the DMV in order to commute to work? No one likes that, but we do it. “I can’t believe I still have to say this after 18 months, but you can spread Covid to other people,” he said. “It’s not just about yourself.”"
"Finding dolls creepy has a long and storied past, from the actual phobia of dolls (pediophobia) to the generally accepted theory that dolls are often unsettling due to the “uncanny valley” effect. There are museums devoted to collecting horrible little mannequins. There are movie franchises about bad dolls that will kill you and your family. And for the past couple of years I’ve been in a private Facebook group called Spooky Doll Hour – and somehow the spooky dolls are the least weird thing about it. The premise of Spooky Doll Hour is really simple: it’s a small Facebook group where you can share pictures, memes and videos of spooky dolls – for one hour only. Spooky Doll Hour is 10:16pm – 11:16 pm New South Wales time (UTC + 10) – and if you post or comment outside of the hour, you will be “removed from the group and haunted by a doll for the rest of your life”. Usually the posts are funny; sometimes they are just pictures of spooky dolls. They are often memes either about spooky dolls or using spooky dolls – but it’s simplistic to just call it a spooky doll meme page. The premise might be simple, but the “why” of it all is more complicated: the way it engages the community, and that community’s adherence to arbitrary rules, all point to a deeper level of humour. “The inspo for this group came from another group called Goblin Hour, which really was in its prime in 2018,” says one of the Spooky Doll Hour founders, James Anthony. The rise and demise of Goblin Hour follows a familiar narrative. It was “popping off” in 2018, Anthony says, quickly reaching thousands of members. Once it got too big, it got toxic. The same goblin memes were repeated; there was persistent infighting about what constituted a goblin. (Is a gremlin a goblin? Is a troll?) There was a nightly argument about who would be crowned the “goblin king”, an honorary title bestowed on whoever posted the final comment of the night. After a deluge of last-minute spam, the fights would become vicious. I was also a part of Goblin Hour, and was equally baffled by it. Anthony and a few others sought a purer space, so formed their own: Spooky Doll Hour. The group represents the hyper-absurd end of the usage spectrum for the platform. Facebook groups are widely used by communities to connect, over anything from a shared neighbourhood, to a favourite TV show, or for utilitarian functions like buying secondhand goods. Facebook introduced the Groups function in 2010, and they have since become the feature most heavily engaged with by regular users, particularly older people. But the earnestness found in these groups lends itself to mockery, and it’s in this space that groups like Spooky Doll Hour sit: community dynamics so soaked in irony that they’re inexplicable to anyone who’s not terminally online. In one group, members pretend they are boomers; another group, called “A group where we all pretend to be ants in an ant colony”, you have to do what it says on the tin: respond like an ant would, posting words like “dig” or “protect the queen”. This one has 1.8 million members. But the line between irony and earnestness increasingly becomes blurred. Anthony tells me about how he and another Spooky Doll Hour co-creator were obsessed with a Facebook group about skulls. “They’re all like middle-aged Americans mostly and … they generally post like, ‘here’s a cool photo of a skull I found’. Everyone would comment like, ‘oh, cool skull. This is bad-ass’ – [or] ‘hell yeah’ or ‘skull yeah’, ‘skull yeah, brother’ or ‘if you like skulls, give me a hell yeah’. And everyone would comment ‘hell yeah’.” These people, he believes, just sincerely love skulls. And while Spooky Doll Group was created as a parody, they’ve ended up filling a similar function: bringing people together who have something in common. In this case, the simple desire to exchange cursed pictures of dolls with each other. As one new group member told me: “There’s something compelling about being in a group with such serious rules about something so ridiculous.” In a world of turmoil and strife and inconsistency, at least you can always rely on your feed being full of pictures of spooky dolls for strictly one hour every night."
"New streaming gems to enjoy from within the comfort of your own four walls. Eris Drew spent lockdown living out a fantasy: the 42-year-old DJ left behind the big city for a remote cabin in the forest. “I always thought it was ridiculous,” she laughs. “I’m a house DJ from Chicago – how can I do that in the woods?” But when the pandemic hit her busy touring schedule “like a train coming to an abrupt stop”, the thought of stillness became enticing. “There was this desire to heal. I think it’s true of all people, but especially as a trans person, getting into nature, outside of the cultural vortex, is very good for the body.” In the quiet of New Hampshire, as wild turkeys strolled by, Drew recorded her debut album – some 25 years into her career. Songwriting became a way to fuse the past, present and future, all while ensconced in a house that “felt like living in a guitar, just surrounded by this reverberating wood”. Gentle, anxious and euphoric, Quivering in Time shares the transformative power of her 90s-influenced sets. “Music is the technology for connection,” she says. “It’s filled with our collective dreams.” It made the cabin a home, building a new sense of community even in isolation. Kinetic, time-bending tracks such as Sensation recreate the full-body heat of the club (“I missed the ritual of that fire”); A Howling Wind captures a stark feeling of loneliness; the title track emits fidgety uncertainty, rockabilly tremolo laced with punchy exhalations of breath. It is cleansing and beautiful, but not quite utopian. “That’s how we get through the muckety-muck of life,” she laughs. “We try to transform it.” Drew is now back on tour, but you can explore her alternate realities from home. After all, she says, “this is the album I used to travel when I couldn’t”.

With his large-scale figurative sculptures of everyday contemporary subjects, typically Black men and women, Thomas J Price has become a trailblazing figure in contemporary British art. “By monumentalisation of the ordinary” – such as a girl texting on her phone – “we are able to critique what we consider important, what we consider valuable within our communities and what we collectively choose to give public space to,” says the London-based sculptor, whose inaugural exhibition, Thoughts Unseen, arrives this autumn. The works span two decades, from early sculpture and film to stop-motion animation, plus new figurative bronzes. Price wanted to highlight a concern that runs throughout his work, “readdressing historic narratives connected to public sculpture” and interrogating our “assumptions of power”. The highlight is All In, his largest bronze to date, standing at a mammoth 12ft tall. Price calls it a “psychological portrait that draws our attention to the systemic racial marginalisation within public sculptures of this scale, and subsequent misinterpretation of Black masculinity and identity”. Meanwhile, his 2018 series Lay It Down depicts the hairstyles of Black women and spotlights restrictive beauty standards, and his 2017 Icon series adopts the ancient Egyptian technique of gilding and places sculptures on luxurious quartzite plinths. The exhibition takes place not far from Bristol, where the statue of Edward Colston was dethroned last summer. It was a historic moment, says Price: “It acknowledged the existence of new contemporary thinking. If we really want to engage with history, and utilise sculptures in public spaces to do so, then there needs to be consultation with the public to get a sense of what people feel. I would like to see monuments look like people that I recognise and relate to, subverting stereotypical heroic images we have been conditioned to expect.” KMHauser & Wirth Somerset, 2 October to 3 January L Devine“Girls like sex / Are you stupid or did you forget?” deadpans L Devine on this summer’s straight-talking hit Girls Like Sex.

Acclaimed director Weise cannot stay away from The Mountaintop. This is the third time he has tackled Pulitzer winner Katori Hall’s play, set on the eve of Martin Luther King’s assassination. There was the critically acclaimed Young Vic staging in 2016 and a live-streamed version last year in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. Now there is a brand new production to mark Weise’s inaugural show as joint artistic director at Manchester’s Royal Exchange Theatre, with ’Tomiwa Edun starring as Dr King and Ntombizodwa Ndlovu as the funny and foul-mouthed maid who spars and smokes with King deep into the night. What keeps Weise coming back to The Mountaintop, after a directorial roll-call that includes the West End transfer of Nine Night, and Master Harold … and the Boys at the National Theatre? Hall put it best, says Weise, when she observed: “The Mountaintop is a play that never ends.” He continues: “Until we start to see a world that we understand is just and fair and safe and inclusive for all, then this is a play we must visit every single time it feels necessary to remind the world of all the bloodshed and suffering and extraordinary work that people have done before us to make it possible to live in the world today.” His perspective on Hall’s play has deepened in time. “I made an incredibly optimistic and hopeful version in 2016. Now I really want to show the ugliness that we have all seen; not to make us depressed, but so that we can all think actively about what our roles will be in shaping the future.” Yet the play is also funny, moving and sexy: “Even when things feel quite challenging there is always laughter and love and light and beauty amid the darkness,” he says.

Both feature Adam Driver, duelling with Matt Damon in medieval France in the former, and pursued by a murderous Lady Gaga in 90s Italy in the latter. SHThe Last Duel in cinemas 15 October; House of Gucci from 24 November Shake off the fug of the last 18 months and venture to some far-out cultural extremes. The walls of Sam Campbell’s flat are carpeted with tiny pieces of paper. “These are my topics,” explains the Australian comic ahead of his new show, Companion, which debuts this month. He angles his webcam to draw special attention to key areas including car number plates, the orange Monzo bank card favoured by travellers, “the Greek island of Crete”, Futurama and “the royal baby”. Which one? “All of them. I tackle every single royal baby.” The randomness of Campbell’s theme wall is nothing compared to the absurdity of his actual standup shows. The 29-year-old’s persona is that of a twitchily aggressive nerd, a man hampered only by his own extreme weirdness, often accompanied by bizarre PowerPoint presentations. His online videos also make use of his ability to create peculiarly, gloriously terrible graphic design; for his one-off Channel 4 sketch show, Get Real Dude, he combined a roster of eccentric, terrifyingly self-assured characters with lo-fi special effects to brilliantly unsettling effect. Campbell started bringing technology into his comedy during his days with Aussie sketch trio Skills in Time. He is still technically resident in Australia, where he is widely acclaimed (he won the 2018 Melbourne international comedy festival award; previous recipients include Ross Noble and Hannah Gadsby), but his talents have also been embraced over here: he is a regular in Sky paramedic sitcom Bloods, has appeared in Stath Lets Flats and Pls Like, and has written for the TV version of cult YouTube show Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared. But he’s not letting his onscreen work distract from his distinctive strain of standup – instead, he’s keen to point out how he is continuing to hone his craft. “I’ve matured a lot as a performer,” he says. “I still scream, but positive screaming. And no spiralling.” RASoho Theatre, W1, 13 to 18 September Our Silver City, 2094Speculative fiction is at the centre of this eerie exhibition set in Nottingham near the end of the 21st century.

Highlights include 35mm showings of the box-office hit Stir Crazy, filmed comedy special Live on the Sunset Strip and the semi-autobiographical Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling, which Pryor wrote, directed and starred in. SHBFI Southbank, SE1, to 4 October No Bounds festivalThe Sheffield festival curates a galaxy of dancefloor stars for a transcendent return to the rave. Lose yourself in Helena Hauff’s gothy techno, India Jordan’s high-stakes intensity and Skee Mask’s trance-like genre fusions – alongside regular circuit fixtures such as Ben UFO and Joy Orbison. KHVarious venues, Sheffield, 15 to 17 October Wet your whistle for the latest Bond film with these appetisers. After a two-year delay, Daniel Craig’s final outing as 007, No Time to Die, is finally arriving in cinemas on 30 September. Will its secret weapon, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, drafted in to polish the script, have managed to skewer (or at least soften) some of the franchise’s signature misogyny? Only one way to find out. Until then – and for anyone awaiting Bond’s home release – here are five Bond-adjacent viewing appointments … Knives Out (2019): Daniel Craig plays detective Benoit Blanc with a camp southern drawl, a reminder of how fun he can be when freed from the stifling chokehold of Bond’s bow tie. On Now TV Jane Eyre (2011): No Time to Die isn’t director Cary Joji Fukunaga’s first stab at adapting a British classic. His take on Charlotte Brontë’s gothic novel is creepy, sexy and criminally underrated. On Netflix Captain Marvel (2019): In No Time to Die Lashana Lynch is the new 007, the franchise’s first Black, female agent – albeit not literally “the new James Bond”, more’s the pity. Get to know her as fighter pilot Maria Rambeau in 2019’s Captain Marvel. On Disney+ Killing Eve (2018 to present): As the creator of Killing Eve, No Time to Die co-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge is certainly well placed to imagine the internal machinations of trained assassins with expensive tastes. On BBC iPlayer On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969): In what is arguably the greatest Bond film of all time, one-hit wonder George Lazenby must outwit a brainwashed army of Blofeld’s international Angels of Death in the snowy Swiss Alps.

"When we started in Wirral in 1988, we really loved the pop charts, Top of the Pops and the Beatles, but when we actually picked up guitars we couldn’t figure out how to do that kind of music. How can you sound like Duran Duran when you’ve got these little Kays Catalogue guitars that you got for Christmas when you were 13? It was only when we started listening to the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Mighty Lemon Drops and My Bloody Valentine that we thought: “We can do that instead.” So we started making walls of noise, but with pop songs underneath. The first couple of records were quite a full-on heavy sound, but we were getting more confident. After the Giant Steps album, which was really eclectic, the idea was to record a whole album of pop songs. Wake Up Boo! was probably born after a late night drunken conversation between [former guitarist] Martin [Carr] and [Creation Records boss] Alan McGee, with McGee saying: “You’ve got to write something big and poppy and get on the radio.” Martin took that to heart. He once said that he wrote the song while watching The Big Breakfast after a night on acid. He was living his own life in Preston at the time, separate from the rest of us, so I wouldn’t know, but he definitely watched The Big Breakfast so the story is entirely possible. When we recorded the song at Rockfield residential studio in Wales there was a night where some sheep got painted blue, but I’d sloped off to bed by then. One morning I came in and Martin had filmed about 40 minutes of a slug giving birth. He said: “It looked fascinating on acid.” Bands don’t really do that stuff now but that kind of useful madness can be highly creative. Wake Up Boo! is a microcosm of Martin’s personality. He can be very up and ebullient – “Wake up, it’s a beautiful morning” – and then he can have that drop: “You have to put the death in everything.” The key line, weirdly, is “summer’s gone”. It’s a very upbeat sounding song but it’s almost a lament, about grabbing the last of summer while you can. We recorded it twice. The first version was heavier and more downbeat, but not radio friendly enough, so we recorded it again in Rockfield. I remember spending hours in the vocal booth doing take after take to get it right. When the song came out it seemed to capture a wave – it was the height of Britpop, just before Cool Britannia. The Wake Up! album went to No 1 and it was very exciting, but it did all fade away pretty quickly. The first I heard of Wake Up Boo! was on a hissy cassette from Martin. I listened to that, then tuned my guitar and came up with a bassline. I don’t remember us being too unhappy about the original version, but when we were mixing it in Peter Gabriel’s Real World Studios it sounded a bit underwhelming, considering how brilliant the song was. There was pressure from Creation to re-record it. When we were in Rockfield – another very expensive studio – Martin put on a Style Council B-side, which gave us the idea to change the rhythm. Rob [Cieka, drums] and I worked out a Motown beat, which began the transformation. Then we made some calls and got in Tom Jones’s brass section, who had been recording in Cardiff, not all that far away. I was given the job of calling them to tell them we didn’t want any trombone. The guy on the phone said: “I am the trombone player”. It was comical, but they came down and were such top professionals that they had it done in half an hour. After it was a hit, we’d gone from making beautiful songs buried in sludge to suddenly being everywhere. We were on Top of the Pops. Chris Evans used Wake Up Boo! for a jingle on his Radio 1 show, which went “Chris Evans on your radio …” All sorts. I never expected that kind of success to last for ever, but they were amazing times. You just think: “Let’s enjoy it while we can.” "
"A large bronze statue of a noble-looking white man stands in a park in central nipaluna/Hobart. Adjacent to the city’s bus mall, it honours William Lodewyk Crowther, a doctor and early premier of Tasmania. Crowther is praised on the accompanying plaque for his “long and zealous political and professional service in this colony.” But the plaque makes no mention of William Lanne, the palawa leader whose corpse he mutilated and skull he stole. Crowther was a surgeon and honorary medical officer in Hobart in 1869 when Lanne – a well-liked whaler (and husband of Truganini, the famous nuenonne leader) – died. Lanne and Truganini were understood at the time to be “the last full-blooded Tasmanians”, so his skeleton was of great value to scientists and naturalists. A veritable bidding war over the rights to his body erupted between Crowther (on behalf of the Royal College of Surgeons in London) and representatives of the Royal Society of Tasmania. Crowther lost. Angered, he and his son snuck into the morgue in the middle of the night, decapitated Lanne’s corpse, peeled back his skin to remove the skull and replaced it with that of another corpse in the morgue. He then sewed the face back on and walked out. Lanne’s hands and feet were removed by another surgeon to prevent Crowther from returning and nabbing the whole skeleton. His remains were never reunited, and their whereabouts are unknown. Despite being held responsible for meddling with the corpse, Crowther went on to rise through the political ranks and, in death, was memorialised in bronze and sandstone paid for by public subscription. There is, of course, no statue of Lanne in Hobart. Over the years there have been quiet requests for the Crowther statue to be taken down and now, as the international tide of opinion about problematic statues turns, the colonist has been removed from view – albeit temporarily. Julie Gough, a trawlwoolway artist from northern lutruwita/Tasmania, has encased the statue in darkened plywood and added her own words to the plinth: “We do not have to look into the face of evil to know that it is there.” Gough’s work is called Breathing Space. It is the third of four artist installations responding to the statue as part of the Hobart city council’s Crowther Reinterpretation Project, which began in April. Each work, either on or near the statue, stays in place for two months: an attempt to engage the public in a conversation about the statue and what to do with it next. Remove it? Preserve it? Amend the plinth’s wording, recontextualising it – or perhaps add a second piece nearby that tells a fuller story? Gough says she just wants it gone, and quickly. “I decided to encase Crowther, to give everyone literally ‘breathing space’ from his presence,” Gough said of her work. “To be able to literally see a way forward, a world without it, by physically demonstrating that the sky doesn’t fall down, the world doesn’t end, when a statue is removed.” The first artist to respond to the statue was Allan Mansell, an Aboriginal activist who went for a more conspicuous statement with Truth Telling: he covered Crowther’s face in a blood-red vinyl “skin”, painted his hands red, and added a saw. The second work, by Roger Scholes and Greg Lehman, The Lanney Pillar, included a poignant film about Lanney’s life called The Whaler’s Tale. A QR code at the statue guides passersby to an online survey. At the time of print – just past halfway through the project – there had been 120 responses, a number lord mayor Anna Reynolds called “pretty good”. “One quarter of respondents think the statue should remain in place, with no changes,” she said. “Another quarter believe it should be completely removed, and about half of the respondents are looking for something that provides a more complete history but doesn’t necessarily see the removal of the statue.” Councillor Simon Behrakis stands firmly with the quarter who want it left alone. He previously called the initiative a “feel-good woke project” and said, “we have limited resources on this council and limited time and we should be directing it to areas where we can actually improve society”. Gough said removing the statue would enable Aboriginal people to better interact with this central part of the city. She actively avoids the park because of its existence. “The Aboriginal understanding is that the statue of this man must be removed, given his history,” she said. “Crowther’s presence in statue form has for 132 years offended, openly disrespected and disregarded the feelings of Aboriginal people, while asserting the power and might of ongoing Anglo-British rule of this island as it overrides First People’s distress. “And regardless … why and how can any statue of any person have no use-by date?” The next installation will be by Jillian Mundy, a photographer and journalist, and will be unveiled in November."
"Louis Theroux’s first series for television, in 1998, was a series of documentaries called Weird Weekends. The central conceit was that Theroux, an innocent abroad, would spend time in a community that was considered fringe, and tell us their stories. Since the series first aired, there is now enough Louis Theroux available on streaming services that it is possible to spend a weird weekend entirely with him. So that is what I did. I sat inside and watched nothing but Louis Theroux films for a whole, weird weekend. I didn’t move through his oeuvre sequentially. Stan has more than 35 Louis Theroux documentaries haphazardly displayed – the titles like a set of playing cards that have been shuffled and thrown down at random. I started only a few years back, with Talking to Anorexia (2017) and Drinking to Oblivion (2016) and then went back to 1998 for Weird Weekends, before fast-forwarding to 2007 for a show on plastic surgery, and so forth. Theroux’s work is easy to dip in and out of. But there is something about taking in the creative products of a long career in one concentrated sweep that allows you to see an edifice emerging, the overall aim of one man’s life’s work: illuminating and humanising the misunderstood. I began my weird weekend with Louis by watching his 2017 special on anorexia. The documentary received criticism for focusing on the very extreme example of eating disorders (in Australia anorexia and bulimia occur in less than 1% of the general population, while other kinds of eating disorders, such as binge eating disorders, affect a much greater number). But focusing on the most harrowing aspects of eating disorders does make for gripping television. Theroux spends time in two of London’s largest eating disorder clinics, meeting patients and grappling with the thorniness of the disease. Why do so many patients not want to get better? What is the best way to treat them? How do you stop people from dying? Attending weigh-ins, eating with them in the clinic, visiting their homes and their parents, sitting in on appointments with doctors – Theroux is pretty gentle here. He’s part therapist, part friend. His questions are searching rather than pointed, but mostly he listens, and the women open up to him. Next up is Savile. This is Theroux’s mea culpa. In the years since Theroux filmed a documentary with him in 2000, Jimmy Savile was revealed to be a sex offender on a grand scale. But for Australian audiences, a lot of the backstory is missing. How did this bizarre and incredibly grim looking man in a string vest end up becoming a beloved children’s entertainer? How on earth could Theroux – evidently so intuitive and intelligent – miss all the signs? Theroux goes back and interviews some of Savile’s victims and interrogates his own work. “What did I miss? What did I get wrong? I really had to look at my own conscience,” says Theroux. One of the victims turns the tables on him. “Do you feel like you were groomed?” No, because he wasn’t abused, Theroux says. “Mentally groomed,” she says. “He mugged you off.” Then I go all the way back to Weird Weekends. Filmed when Theroux was in his 20s, all gangly limbs and John Lennon specs and oversized shirts, he appears to be more easily swept along by the enthusiasms of his subjects; more agreeable and less likely to be confrontational. There are five episodes, all from series one, on Stan. I start with an episode on Christianity. Theroux is in Texas, where he visits an assortment of Christians: some televangelists who hope he’ll decide to become Born Again, a man who hopes to convert people by driving around the state with Christian bumper stickers, and a group called The Family who walk around a nightclub district singing Christian hymns in the hope of converting passersby. Theroux doesn’t ask too many hard questions in this early series. His shtick is to fit in and make people comfortable, so they’ll relax and maybe reveal something of themselves. He’s charming and young, but the early shows lack the ambition to go beyond the first layer of skin. By 2016, there is less drift (and also less joy) but far greater empathy and much deeper engagement with his subjects. He’s less about trying to fit in, and more about illuminating subcultures from different angles. It’s evident, as my weird weekend with Louis progresses back and forth through time, how good he is at interviewing people. He’s not even really interviewing them – he’s having a conversation, trying to create a connection. This empathetic connection to his subjects is Theroux’s greatest contribution to the documentary genre. He’s made films about sex work and pornography, addiction, religion and far-right political extremism. His subjects have traditionally been in peril, marginalised, misunderstood or just plain odd. He is our bridge from their world to ours. His empathy is not merely a passive flow of connection and goodwill towards subjects but involves the work of listening, challenging them, spending time with them and properly seeing them in all their humanity, flaws and complexity. Friday turns into Saturday, which turns into Sunday. I watch Louis watch people shoot up. I watch Louis have liposuction in LA. I watch Louis watching people make porn. I watch Louis hang out with paedophiles and Nazis and the most hated family in America. I learn something new and fascinating about human nature in each episode. After 10 hours of documentaries, I wonder if the universities should just shut down the journalism schools and make people just watch Louis Theroux’s shows. It’s all there. How to gain trust with a closed group. How to interrogate someone’s position without totally alienating them. How to give someone the space to tell their own story. When to go hard with questions, when to pull back, how to learn from your mistakes when you miss the story, and how, without empathy, the stories will die through lack of heart."
"In Guardian Australia’s series, Ask A Children’s Author, writers open themselves up to questions from their young readers – about their books, about their characters, about anything at all, really. First up was Andy Griffiths – the author of the Bad Book series, the Bum series and, of course, the number one bestselling 13-Storey Treehouse series – who answered all manner of questions about writing, about his next book, and about whether or not his bum has ever come off. Then we had Garth Nix, whose bestselling books, including the Old Kingdom, Seventh Tower and Keys to the Kingdom series, are read by fantasy enthusiasts of all ages. He talked about queer representation, perfectionism and his writing tips – and answered some very curly questions too.  Now we have Alison Lester, who has been delighting younger readers – and their parents – for more than 30 years with her beautiful illustrated children’s picture books including My Farm, Imagine, and Magic Beach, as well as her board books and young adult novels.  If your child loves her stories, her illustrations, or both, and would like to ask her a question, please post it in the comments along with their first name, age and city. Or you can film them asking the question and email the video to australia.culture@theguardian.com with the subject heading “Alison Lester”. The question might make it into the video we publish with all her answers – so long as you send it before Monday 6 July."
"The comedian Jo Brand will not be investigated further for a joke about throwing battery acid at politicians, the broadcasting watchdog has said. Last June, Brand had joked on BBC Radio 4’s Heresy show, after milkshake had been thrown at several political figures by members of the public: “I’m thinking why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid.” The remark triggered a debate about the limits of freedom of speech, particularly in terms of satire, and the Metropolitan police briefly considered launching an investigation. An Ofcom spokeswoman said: “Acid attacks are extremely serious crimes. We found that these comments had clear potential to offend listeners. But we also considered the audience’s likely expectations of Jo Brand’s style – and of this established show, which sets out to challenge accepted views in society through provocative comedy. “We also took into account that Ms Brand immediately qualified her comments, making it clear they shouldn’t be taken seriously or acted upon.” Responding to complaints after the show was broadcast last year, the BBC initially defended the comedian, but later said the remark was inappropriate for a Radio 4 comedy show. The broadcaster dismissed claims from Nigel Farage that Brand was inciting violence. The Brexit party leader was doused with a milkshake in the run-up to the European elections. The BBC added that jokes made on Heresy were “deliberately provocative as the title implies”, and were not intended to be taken seriously. The Heresy show is billed as a “discussion programme which challenges established ideas and questions received wisdom”. After making the comments, Brand immediately made clear she was joking and criticised the milkshake stunts. “That’s just me. I’m not going to do it,” she said. “It’s purely a fantasy, but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I honestly do, sorry.” The comedian later apologised for making a “crass and ill-judged” joke."
"Despite rising case numbers in numerous states – Florida, Arizona and Texas each reported their highest single-day case totals to date – the Trump administration “has decided to just move on from the coronavirus pandemic”, Seth Meyers noted on Wednesday’s Late Night. Donald Trump has blamed the uptick in case numbers on an increase in testing, a deflection Meyers found ludicrous. “I can’t believe I have to explain this,” Meyers said. “If we stopped testing, that wouldn’t mean the cases went away. That would just mean we don’t know about them. When you play peekaboo with a baby, the baby can’t see you but that doesn’t mean you actually disappeared. “Now this is a sentiment Trump has repeated several times – if only we could stop testing, we’d look so much better – which is just insane. It’s like if you went to your optometrist, and they said, ‘I could give you an eye exam, but then you’d need glasses to drive.’ That doesn’t mean you don’t need glasses, it just means you’ll probably get in more car accidents.” Meyers also noted that top US infectious disease experts such as Dr Anthony Fauci agree that recently rising case numbers are tied to loosened social restrictions in various states, and have openly contradicted the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Fauci said the increase in cases could not be explained by increased testing, “which is just obviously true”, Meyers said. “What do you think is more likely to be responsible for an increase in cases of infectious disease: increased testing, or reopening gyms, malls, barber shops, bowling alleys, massage parlors? “And yet, the Trump administration is committed to the lie that the coronavirus has just disappeared, when in reality it never went away, and it is in fact getting worse.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert dug into the much-hyped book by Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton. Several newspapers released excerpts from The Room Where It Happened on Wednesday, Colbert explained, and “I can’t believe I’m saying this: it’s worse than even I imagined.” Bolton’s book, which the Trump administration has attempted to block from publication, features stories about the president and his administration which ranged, according to Colbert, from “amoral idiocy to just downright evil”. “According to Bolton, Trump’s ignorance is near-bottomless. Apparently, Trump didn’t seem to know that Britain was a nuclear power and asked if Finland was part of Russia. Now, you can understand his confusion there, because under President Trump, it feels like we’re kind of part of Russia.” Bolton, who is scheduled to appear on The Late Show next week to discuss the book, also claims that he was told on his first day of work in 2018 by then chief of staff John Kelly – who was reportedly “desperate” to leave – that the White House was a “bad place to work”. “Sounds like working there was like the movie Get Out, except the characters were more hostile to black people,” Colbert said before turning his glare to Kelly. “While we’re on the subject, boo-fucking-hoo, General. It’s the White House, not Dairy Queen. If it’s this horrible of a place, you’re obliged to tell the world about the crimes and save the nation. Not privately bitch about it with your buddy until there’s an opening at Cold Stone Creamery.” Colbert also condemned Bolton, who wrote that “obstruction of justice” seemed to be “a way of life” for Trump that “we couldn’t accept”. “John Bolton knew it was wrong to stand idly by and accept the president repeatedly obstructing justice. He knew that the right thing was to stand idly by and wait on that book deal.” “See you Tuesday, sir,” he added. And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed the resurgence of coronavirus cases, which have very much not gone away. China, for example has enacted shutdown measures in Beijing after 100 new cases were reported in the capital. “Wait a minute, China is shutting down Beijing because of 100 cases? Either China takes this way more seriously than everyone else or there’s something they’re not telling us again.” Meanwhile, cases are also on the rise in several US states, which Donald Trump has blamed not on reopening measures but on the increase in testing. Earlier this week, he told reporters that there would be fewer cases if fewer tests were conducted – logic which is “technically right”, Noah noted, because “if you don’t test anybody, then you don’t have any cases. The same way if black people stopped recording the cops, we would have zero cases of police brutality. Ignorance is bliss.” In other coronavirus news, researchers have generally reached consensus that the most risky environment for the spread of virus is mass indoor gatherings in which people are talking – such as, for example, the political rally Trump plans to hold in Tulsa, Oklahoma, this weekend. “Now, we know the total nightmare scenario for catching coronavirus would be like a big crowded indoor event where thousands of people are packed together, screaming and chanting about locking someone up,” Noah said. “But luckily, no one would do such a thing.”"
"Lily Cole has apologised for posting a photograph online in which she is wearing a burqa as part of an attempt to promote her new book. The model and activist was criticised for posting in the same week as Kabul fell to the Taliban, raising fears for women’s rights in Afghanistan. Her Instagram story, which has been deleted, contained two images: one of her in a blue burqa covering her face and body, and another in which the garment was pulled up to show her face. A caption read: “Let’s embrace diversity on every level – biodiversity; cultural diversity; diversity of thinking; diversity of voices; diversity of ideas.” Among those who challenged her was one Instagram user who told her that the Taliban forced women to wear the burqa. It comes as women in Afghanistan speak out about their fears of hard-fought rights being taken away. In a Guardian report last week, one Kabul woman told of haggling with shopkeepers over rapidly inflating burqa prices. As the Taliban’s final advance picked up pace, once again the burqa has been pulled out of dusty storerooms and cupboards by women who remember life under the Islamist group’s rule. Cole subsequently wrote in a statement of apology that she had shared “an old photo” of her wearing a burqa that had been loaned by a friend. “As she pointed out I was undermining its original purpose by wearing it with my face exposed, but I understand why the image has upset people and want to sincerely apologise for any offence caused,” Cole said. “I hadn’t read the news at the time I posted so it was incredibly ill timed. Thank you for pointing that out to me.” She said her heart was breaking as she read about events in Afghanistan and she was looking for organisations who were helping women on the ground there. The columnist Janice Turner wrote of the model’s original post: “Lily Cole and the vacuity of modern hashtag-feminism. Putting Instagram posturing before universal human rights. I bet Afghan women are celebrating the ‘diversity’ of wearing this shroud.” Cole’s original post had been used to promote her new book, Who Cares Wins. Its publisher, Penguin, bills it as providing “a plethora of solutions guaranteed to inspire and create lasting global change”."
"The actor formerly known as Thandie Newton has said she will reclaim the original Zulu-derived spelling of her name for use in her professional career, declaring: “I’m taking back what’s mine.” For more than 30 years, the actor, born Melanie Thandiwe Newton Parker, has been known by an anglicised version of her name since the “w” was dropped “carelessly” from her first acting credit. Thandiwe, meaning “beloved”, said she was setting the record straight and that in all future projects she would be credited with her name spelled correctly. In an interview with British Vogue, Newton, who played a character called Thandiwe in her first film, Flirting, in 1991, declared: “That’s my name. It’s always been my name. I’m taking back what’s mine.” The Westworld actor, who will appear on the cover of the May issue hailing the “rebirth of an icon”, spoke to the writer Diana Evans for the magazine about her three decades-long career and what had and had not changed in the industry. “The thing I’m most grateful for in our business right now is being in the company of others who truly see me. And to not be complicit in the objectification of Black people as ‘others’, which is what happens when you’re the only one,” she said. Evans says Newton’s awareness that she was a role model for little brown girls who aspired to be dancers or actors or activists was one reason she considered it essential that her clothes in the Vogue photoshoot reflected her dual heritage. As she had become older, she had been inspired to use her personal experiences to be more outspoken, Newton, 48, said. “I’ve changed a whole lot. Many lives have been lived since then.” Last week, the actor expressed outrage over the government’s  report on race disparity and suggested it had to be an April fool’s joke. “There’s no way it can be real – it would be unethical insanity,” she tweeted of the report, which claimed institutional racism did not exist in the UK. The Emmy award-winning actor was born in London to a white British father, Nick, and a Zimbabwean mother, Nyasha, a princess of the Shona tribe, and the family settled in Penzance, Cornwall, when she was three. “We may as well have been the first Black people anyone had ever seen. We didn’t have conditioner. We didn’t have anything,” she told Vogue. She and her younger brother attended a Catholic primary school run by nuns, where she was once excluded from a class picture for wearing her hair in cornrows, and was repeatedly overlooked for dance trophies. Newton said she calls herself a Londoner as opposed to British, reflecting on her Bafta win in 2006 when a UK newspaper pointed out that she was not really British because one of her parents was Black. “I remember thinking, ‘But it’s a British win! Why don’t you wanna take that? Why would you not wanna dig that and embrace it and feel really good?’” The actor also discussed why she recently spoke publicly about the abuse she had suffered at the hands of a director when she was 16 and the moment she realised she needed to seek help for an eating disorder. “There’s a moment where the ghost of me changed, you know, and it was then, it was 16. He derailed me from myself utterly. I was traumatised. It was a kind of PTSD for sure. “I was so distraught and appalled that a director had abused a young actress, and that it was happening elsewhere, minors getting abused and how f**ked up it was. I was basically waiting for someone to come along and say, ‘Well, what shall we do about this?” She told Vogue she refused to be silenced: “I have a seventh sense for abuse and abusers, which I believe is one of the reasons why I was rejected a lot in Hollywood. I’ll talk about it until the cows come home, because I know I’ll be helping someone.”"
"Born in Dublin in 1962, Anne Enright studied English and philosophy at Trinity College Dublin and received an MA in creative writing from the University of East Anglia. Formerly an RTE television producer, she has written two collections of stories, published together as Yesterday’s Weather, one book of essays and seven novels, including the 2007 Booker prize-winning The Gathering and The Forgotten Waltz, which was awarded the Andrew Carnegie medal for excellence in fiction. In 2015, she was named the inaugural laureate for Irish fiction. Her latest novel, Actress, published by Vintage, is out in paperback now. Killiney Hill, near Dublin This is my local lockdown park and it has been a kind of privilege to walk the same woodland path through the changing seasons. It turned into a series of anticipations. From first growth through to the blackening rust of autumn, each week was a peak for some absurdly beautiful effect – and you might miss it somehow. You might come just after the first spring leaves, you might miss the best autumn display. And of course you don’t miss anything – the woodland is always just what it is. Now, the gorse is finished but the hawthorn is out, a blossom whose scent makes me feel a little drunk. Next week, something new. Mare of Easttown (Sky Atlantic) I was not convinced by the first few minutes of Mare of Easttown, which looked like another humourless procedural shot in the goddamn dark, but there was something so utter about Kate Winslet’s joylessness, I could not click away. It took me a while to see the thin east coast light and the texture of ordinary lives coming through. Winslet is a miracle of containment. This isn’t like watching a performance, it is like watching a woman take herself back from all the ideas we might have about her. Mare is a slow and splendid “fuck you”. Lankum I can’t believe how much live music I casually missed in my old life, because there would always be another gig coming along. I have never seen Lankum live, for example, which is now a top regret. They are steeped in tradition and completely contemporary. Their work is a reminder that folk music is not about twinkly-eyed peasants tapping the foot – this is fearsome stuff, it is the music of dispossession and of dissent. But you can also tap along if you like. Which, when the world comes right again, I intend to do. The End of the World Is a Cul de Sac by Louise Kennedy I don’t want to spook the talent and Louise Kennedy may be well spooked by the enthusiasm and praise that have been lavished on her debut book of short stories (no pressure, Louise!). But there is much to celebrate when someone catches a moment, when their prose brings something both new and recognisable to the page. Kennedy has presence and that presence has been enlivening various small publications for some years now, so it is terrific to see her at full stretch in this collection. This writer does not stint. Brain, Mind and the Narrative Imagination by Christopher Comer and Ashley Taggart (2021) This is a recent look by a neurologist and a literary theorist at how stories happen in the brain. You can think about thinking all you like, you can be conscious of your consciousness, or imagine what it is to imagine things, but there is nothing like an MRI scan to take you out of yourself. This hybrid volume is clear enough to be used as an overview of the issues, both philosophical and scientific, as it moves carefully through the territory of the human imagination to ask the question: “Why does a good story blow your mind?” Ferns This spring, I couldn’t stop looking at the baby fern fronds unfurling on the hill. Back home, on the internet, their wonderful symmetries starred in various YouTube discussions of fractals and Fibonacci numbers, but the curls within curls also reminded me of a bishop’s crozier and suddenly I was scrolling through various kinds of foliage in medieval manuscripts. And what a wealth of vellum there is, online. The internet is a terrible distraction but, sometimes, there is a kind of mystical, over-connected quality to it all that floats me through the day. If you don’t believe me, Google ferns."
"Thirty-one British-based cross-generational painters feels too many for getting much of a handle on anyone’s work in this survey of both better and lesser-known artists. All play with the medium, and with what figurative painting can be, how it slides into abstraction and fantasy and back again, and what it can describe. AS Hayward Gallery, London, 9 September-12 December Having been postponed from early summer, the sixth edition of Photo London finally goes ahead with exhibitions, events (in-person and online), and works on display from 91 galleries from 17 countries. Highlights include the UK premiere of Lands of Dreams by Shirin Neshat, this year’s recipient of the Master of Photography award, and Close Enough, a Robert Capa retrospective. SO’H Somerset House, London, 9-28 September. In Coventry for the first time, as part of the city’s UK year of culture, the post-pandemic shortlist consists entirely of artist collectives from London, Belfast, Hastings and Cardiff, all using different kinds of social engagement – agitprop, music, film, food – in collaborative, funny, serious and absurd ways. Too much to unpack here, and I would not be surprised if they all win. AS Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Coventry, 29 September-12 January. Considering clay from its transformation of mute silicates into artistic and utilitarian objects, and working with and making interventions in the V&A’s ceramic collections, Gates looks at eastern and western craft and artistic practices. As well as his own work – including film, installation and large stoneware vessels, Gates examines global trade, colonialism, slavery and abolitionism. A parallel show at White Cube and his conception of next year’s Serpentine Pavilion are all in the pot. AS Whitechapel Gallery and other venues, London, 29 September to 9 January. The energy and flow of Hokusai’s waves, winds and volcanoes make him one of the first modern artists. Mixing Chinese landscape tradition, European perspectives and his own restlessness in early 19th-century Japan, he brought the woodblock print into a new age. Here, a rare find of original drawings gives an intimate encounter with genius. JJ British Museum, London, 30 September-30 January. Kikuji Kawada’s original version of Chizu (The Map), an elegiac visual meditation on the trauma of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is the most acclaimed, ornately designed and coveted Japanese photobook – a first edition from 1965 currently changes hands for £18,500. This new edition by Mack is a facsimile of the two-volume maquette handmade by Kawada and acquired by the New York Public Library in 2001. Not as elaborate as the first edition, but a thing of dark beauty in itself. SO’H Mack Books, published September 2021. Figuration and abstraction, the legacies of minimalism and the Harlem renaissance, Robert Rauschenberg’s Combine paintings, the experiences of growing up in Grenada and New York, the digital and the handmade are all in the mix of Barrington’s steadily evolving art. As soon as you point to a reference, it has slid somewhere else. Sometimes Barrington is a poet, endlessly figuring things out. AS South London Gallery, from 1 October. The celebrated sculptor shows his paintings – and they reveal him as a fan of Francis Bacon. Like the Soho master, Kapoor paints flesh turned inside out. Gory sensual streaks and smears of bloody reds and organic purples will make this an imposing, even claustrophobic and shocking journey to the butcher’s shop of the heart. JJ Modern Art Oxford, 2 October-13 February. Korean American Anicka Yi has worked with bacteria, DNA swabs and scents. She uses anxieties about smell and infection as metaphor as much as material. In Yi’s disturbing and timely art, she considers bio-politics and the relationship between the living and non-living, microbiological processes, pathogenic spread and contagion. The interconnectedness of inside and outside, the macro and the micro might be considered sculptural and cultural as much as they are scientific. AS Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London, 12 October-16 January. As the climate crisis intensifies this may be the most urgent exhibition of the year. Salgado has journeyed through the Brazilian Amazon to reveal its hidden worlds, showing how much there is still to save, and how tragic it would be to let rapacity and ignorance destroy such resources. His photographs are as rich and authoritative as great paintings. JJ Science Museum, London, 13 October-March. This retrospective of Bristol-born photographer Stephen Gill takes us from inner-city life in London to rural Sweden, where he now lives. Gill’s photographic experiments including burying his images in the ground, introducing pieces of detritus and live ants into the camera’s body and adulterating his photochemicals with fizzy drinks. Recent work uses remote cameras to record the teeming night-life of the forest. Gill has a magical eye. AS Arnolfini, Bristol, 16 October-16 January. Glasgow-born and Brussels-based, McKenzie might be taken for an old-fashioned exponent of trompe l’oeil and painted architectural illusions. There’s much more to her though, including her open-ended collaborative fashion design as Atelier EB with Scottish designer Beca Lipscombe. This promises a rich and surprising show. AS Tate Liverpool, 20 October-27 March. Taking us from 1825 to the artist’s death in 1837, from the clouds over Hampstead and south coast storms at sea, Stonehenge undisturbed and falling down and an impossible rainbow, Constable’s late work, skirmishing with light and intemperate weather and reveals as much about the artist’s state of mind as his subjects. From the closely observed to the hugely dramatic, there’s nothing bucolic here. AS Royal Academy, London, 30 October-13 February. A deep dive into the V&A’s collection of contemporary art photography that aims to show how the medium can subvert and transform the familiar into something more resonant and even unsettling. Expect a wide range of approaches, from Mitch Epstein’s portraits of New York’s oldest trees to Tereza Zelenkova’s darkly enigmatic monochrome tableaux that reference Victorian spirit photography, superstition and folklore. SO’H Victoria and Albert Museum, London, from 6 November. The future has happened and it’s bleak. The river has risen and there are seasons of fire. Imagine the blackened stumps of Sherwood, the evacuations, the shortages and the new religions. The result of conversations and speculations by school students, geographers, climate scientists, artists and a novelist, Our Silver City, 2094 takes place in what was once an art gallery, now a home to a new culture, filled with repurposed artefacts, ghostly radio transmissions and – God forbid – a new spirituality. AS Nottingham Contemporary, 20 November-18 April. Albrecht Dürer was the most curious artist of the Renaissance, drawing a rhinoceros, risking his life to see a beached whale, awestruck by Aztec art and, visiting Venice, feasting his eyes on good-looking soldiers. This is an eye-opening encounter with the truly open mind of Nuremberg’s answer to Leonardo da Vinci. JJ National Gallery, London, 20 November-27 February. The most convincing recent winner of the Turner Prize is also the oldest, receiving it in 2017 in her 60s. Now she has a retrospective of her radical and restless art that shows why she so stands out, moving easily – yet never comfortably – from painting to installation to conceptual analysis with a raw Hogarthian edge. JJ Tate Modern, London, 25 November-3 July. In his film Caravaggio, this inimitable British visionary portrayed the great baroque artist as queer outlaw. His own artworks have a visceral intensity that has much in common with Caravaggio: brutal, slashing paint congested with emotive, poetic found stuff. His films, cross-cutting punk and Christopher Marlowe, popularised the moving image as art. JJ Manchester Art Gallery and Home, 1 December-10 April. The artist who painted Barack Obama’s official portrait takes on the European canon in one of its holiest temples. Wiley dives into the National Gallery’s collection of sublime landscapes to provocatively remake the Romanticism of Turner and Friedrich. This should be an explosive encounter that brings a venerable gallery kicking and screaming into now. JJ National Gallery, London, 10 December-18 April. From its oval entrance lobby lined with a disorienting array of mirrored doors, to the whirlpool bath shaped like an upside-down baroque dome, the house of the late architectural theorist Charles Jencks is a beguiling postmodern fantasy. This autumn, it is opening to the public for the first time. Don’t miss the library, designed as a “city of books”, with shelves reflecting the different styles of the architects whose books they house. OW 19 Lansdowne Walk, London, from 24 September. “Sickness, madness, and death were the black angels that guarded my crib,” wrote Edvard Munch. The tormented Norwegian painter has a suitably forbidding new home, looming above Oslo’s waterfront in the form of a crooked grey watchtower. Clad in a ghostly shroud of perforated aluminium, bent at the top as if peering down over the harbour, the Munch Museum provides 13 floors to show the collection of almost 27,000 works. OW Bjørvika, Oslo, opens 22 October. A surreal thicket of trees pokes above the top of the new Boijmans Depot in Rotterdam, like lettuce leaves sticking out of a gigantic salad bowl. This huge mirror-polished vessel is a new open-storage facility for the city’s illustrious Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, where the public will be able to see its entire 150,000-item collection, alongside restorers and archivists in action. OW Museumpark, Rotterdam, from 6 November. Concrete bowls and half-pipes bulge from the cafe ceiling of F51 in Folkestone, signalling the presence of the world’s first vertical skatepark overhead. Billed as an “adrenaline building”, this dramatic new youth hub will house facilities for skateboarding, BMX, climbing, bouldering, boxing and more – in a building that was originally planned to be a multistorey car park. OW Opens November."
