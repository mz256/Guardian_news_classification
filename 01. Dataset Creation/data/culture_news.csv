"Over three centuries, it has been ravaged by fire and the wrecking ball. But now the world’s first factory will rise again from the ashes of its former self, repurposed as a new cathedral for the maker movement. Amid huge interest in creating and refashioning things, Derby’s Museum of Making, which opens this spring, is launching at an auspicious time. “Look at how popular TV programmes like The Repair Shop are,” said Tony Butler, executive director of Derby Museums. “Making resonates with the public.” The maker movement is a subculture that embraces and celebrates the physical act of creating something. Borrowing from traditional hobbies such as woodworking, textile design and metalwork, there is a strong emphasis on repurposing existing objects and finding fun and fulfilment in the act of creation. Couple the huge interest in making with the UK’s desire to understand its new post-Brexit role in the world while grappling with its colonial past and the climate crisis, and it may transpire that the museum is the attraction the country did not know it needed right now. “We are really keen on putting forward the idea that every young person can be a maker,” Butler said. “The challenges that we face in the 21st century, things like climate change and environmental loss, much of that will be mitigated by technology, engineering and ingenuity, and those are the kind of makers we need in the future.” The museum is located in Derby city centre on the site of a silk mill that opened in 1721 and whose claim to being the world’s first factory lies in the fact that it was the first fully mechanised mill supplied by a single power source. With £18m funding from the national lottery, local development agencies and the Arts Council, there are hopes that the museum, located in the Derwent Valley Mills Unesco World Heritage Site, will show how people can be attracted back into city centres in a post-Covid world. Those behind the museum say there has been extensive consultation among the local community, with their feedback helping shaping its design. Volunteers even cleaned 11,000 bricks from the original factory to be repurposed in the new building. “The site has changed since the first factory burned down,” explained Hannah Fox, director of projects and programmes at the museum. “Bits of it have fallen down and there have been major disasters over 300 years of its life, but every single time something happened it was rebuilt by the city because it was so important.” The new building, designed by Bauman Lyon Architects, retains the original factory’s Italianate tower, its arches and Grade I-listed gates but, in Fox’s words it will be “a kind of mash-up of lots of different periods”. “We are redefining it for what it needs to be at this time, and that is a place that really tells a story and inspires people to see themselves as makers,” Fox said. Butler explained that an “entire culture” had emerged out of the worldwide maker movement. “It’s not just lads with beards in their sheds in Shoreditch tinkering with old bikes. That whole culture of making resonates with someone, whether they’re in San Francisco or London or Derby.” He said the new museum would explore the links between the factory in its first incarnation and the Derby of today, home to the likes of Rolls-Royce and Toyota. But it would also confront the relationship between the industrial revolution and today’s problems, such as the devastating legacy of fossil fuels and the textile industry’s reliance on slavery. “The general, pervasive view of the industrial revolution in Britain is very much that of the ‘great man’ narrative,” Butler said. “There’s this idea that the industrial revolution was down to unique British exceptionalism. We want to acknowledge that innovation can be driven by individual revelation and genius, but the revolution also did rely, in the factory system’s case, on a ready supply of workers and raw resources.” Almost all of the museum’s 30,000 artefacts will be on display. “Most museums have the majority of their collections in store but this museum will have pretty much everything accessible to the public,” Fox said. “They range from a huge engine donated by Rolls-Royce to a fantastic little engine run by a single human hair that was showcased at the Chicago World’s Fair in the 1930s.” The museum will also return to the manufacturing roots of the original factory by making things – including exhibition displays that will be built on site and sold to other museums. “It will be a full workshop space for new businesses to prototype and manufacture things they want to take to market,” Fox said. “It’s a place of making in every sense.” A previous museum on the site closed in the mid 2000s. “Visitor numbers were dwindling,” Butler explained. “It was to do with the way in which the narrative was framed as something that was inherently in the past. It meant fewer and fewer people were coming to visit the museum. It was seen as almost a paean or a longing for a lost industrial age. What we are trying to do with this museum is make it contemporary and relevant to the sorts of work in which people are engaged today.”",culture
"Of course, everyone had a cameo in Ricky Gervais’s TV industry comedy. But even in this crowded field, Bowie stole the show. After all, funny as Ross Kemp was, he wasn’t going to be able to perform a deliciously cruel song (“He’s banal and facile, he’s a fat waste of space”) mocking the sitcom’s hero. In a show about empty fame, Bowie was a reminder of what talent actually means. God moves in mysterious ways. And like most religious figureheads, his son can manifest him or herself in any form. If, like Johnny Vegas’s Moz, you were a grubby stoner seeking guidance, why wouldn’t Jesus take the appearance of the Fall frontman? Bathed in a heavenly glow, Smith swears lustily as he dispenses enigmatic advice. Amusingly, Leslie Knope begins the scene containing Biden’s cameo by pondering the possibility that she might run for the presidency in 2020. She then meets the man we now know as the president-elect – and their encounter suggests that, for all Leslie’s charm, when it came to taking down Donald Trump, America made the right choice. Kingsley is very much in Hollywood luvvie mode here, not Don “Sexy Beast” Logan mode. He’s approached to star in Christopher Moltisanti’s film Cleaver but is unimpressed by the idea. His dismissive tone leads to Christopher reverting to gangster type – as Kingsley’s fellow guest star Lauren Bacall discovers to her cost. Created specifically for Minogue by Russell T Davies, waitress Astrid Peth was a very temporary companion for David Tennant’s Doctor in the 2007 Christmas special. Although we barely got to know Astrid, she still managed to save the world. Even then, reviews were mixed. Tough crowd. Part of Swift’s appeal is her quality of being simultaneously striking and deeply normal. So her brief cameo in New Girl – where she suddenly upends Cece and Shivrang’s wedding by declaring her feelings for Shivrang – worked perfectly. Her appearance provided both a startled jolt and a knowing smile. The “blink and you’ll miss it” quality of this cameo adds to its appeal. In the last ever episode of Father Ted, “Father Brian Eno”, as he’s introduced, is on screen for a couple of seconds. In pre-streaming days, when watching something again meant waiting for a repeat, you might even wonder if it happened at all. Much as The Bill was an essential stamp in any young British actor’s passport, so it was in the US with Law & Order. The show always liked a cameo, too – but even viewers used to surprising guest appearances did a double take when tennis star Serena Williams turned up, playing a basketball player and revenge porn victim. The premise for this cameo was that Will (Pitt) was an old school friend whose dislike of Rachel had led to him start a rumour that she was intersex. It is offensive and surprising in equal measure, but back in 2001 the main source of intrigue was the fact that Jennifer Aniston was starring opposite her real-life husband. “You look like me. Magnum, as well.” The nightclub encounter between Bernard Hill’s tragic hero Yosser Hughes and Liverpool FC’s moustachioed hard man Graeme Souness is both funny and deeply sad. Hughes is a desperate man, robbed of agency and identity by forces beyond his control; Souness is both a point of aspiration and a focus for his anger.",culture
"Ballet dancer Francesca Hayward was born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992 and moved to West Sussex at the age of two. She began training at the Royal Ballet School aged 11, and on graduating joined the company. Within a year, she was cast as Clara in The Nutcracker and in 2016 became a principal dancer. She played the role of Victoria in Tom Hooper’s film of the musical Cats and last year starred in the film Romeo and Juliet: Beyond Words. The Royal Ballet and Opera is streaming productions via its website. Full details at roh.org.uk. Apartamento I am about to move flats and it has got me really into interiors. I’m a massive magazine hoarder, which I got from my grandmother. I love this magazine because it’s a little less done than the usual interiors magazines. It’s off the beaten track, a bit quirky and original. People pick up things from flea markets and it’s not about having really expensive stuff - it’s about the way you put stuff together. I feel that people don’t really tidy their rooms before the photographers come in, which I like. More real! Pina (Directed by Wim Wenders) This whole year, being at home and not being able to dance and not having the freedom or the space to move the way I like to, I have found myself going back to one of my favourite dance films, about German choreographer Pina Bausch. She died some years ago, but I love her work. It is very modern and very ahead of its time. There’s this particular walk the dancers all do in a procession. There are four hand gestures they do with facial expressions and it brings me so much joy. When I was getting a bit frustrated at home, I would just be in my tiny flat doing the Pina Bausch walk by myself. Night Sky With Exit Wounds by Ocean Vuong I just read Night Sky With Exit Wounds and considering I’m not a poetry fanatic, I found it really beautiful. Sometimes, I find poetry a bit too vague; I don’t really understand it and I don’t pretend to. I love dance, as sometimes there is so much stuff you can’t particularly express, but you get it when you watch it though you might not be able to explain it. And this book is the kind of poetry you can understand. It is pretty special. Succession (Sky Atlantic/NowTV) It’s about a billionaire family living in New York. They’re all fighting to lead the family company. There is a lot of betrayal and twists and turns, but it is kind of comical. They’re a crazy bunch of characters but what I loved about it was that each actor in it was really committed to their role. They were so believable as their own individual person. The one who made me laugh the most was probably Roman, played by Kieran Culkin. Pastificio Gentile pasta I hate cooking with a passion. I hate everything to do with it. I’m not a natural chef. It stresses me out! But I do a lot of pasta. This spaghetti brand — I discovered it by accident. I just picked it up in the supermarket and it changed my life. It sounds really dramatic but I just love it. My most simple meal is caramelised onions and parmesan and my most indulgent is tomato, mascarpone and burrata. The spaghetti just tastes the best with everything and is so satisfying when you twirl it around the fork. Secret People (Thorold Dickinson, 1952) I haven’t watched this yet but it is on my list because there was a documentary about Audrey Hepburn that recently came out [Audrey] that I was involved in and I learned so much about her. I never knew that her first dream was to be a ballerina before an actress. She actually does a lot of ballet in Secret People. I’ve seen clips and she looks very beautiful as a dancer, so I’m intrigued to see her doing her thing. We all just know her as a beautiful woman and presence on the screen but it is very different to know that she fell into that and her real passion was for ballet.",culture
"Dust and rain storm at Parkes, NSW, AustraliaJason Davies/Severe Weather Australia 19 January Dust storms are a pretty common occurrence in Central New South Wales but a colleague said to me: “You might want to come and look at this one.” He was right. It looked far more apocalyptic than usual – so I quickly got my drone up to take some shots. This image captures the gravity of the storm and makes it look really dramatic; I was in the right place at the right time. It went viral in Australia but I still love showing it to people for the first time. You see their jaws drop because it looks so surreal – a lot of people think it’s a scene from a movie! AM Locust swarms plague KenyaDai Kurokawa/EPA 24 January These huge swarms of desert locusts caused devastation across East Africa and the Middle East. We had a Kenyan reporter from Kitui County as part of our team who was able to locate affected farmers, including the young man in this picture. As you can see, the locusts were pink, which wasn’t what I expected. The ones that came from Yemen and Somalia were yellow, but then they died and were replaced by a new generation – young locusts are pink during their first week of life. You can take pictures of locusts in the sky, but I wanted to capture the magnitude of the swarm, which meant getting people in the shot. The farmers were desperately trying to chase away the insects – they tried many techniques, including banging pots and pans to create as much noise as possible. This farmer was chasing the locusts around with a machete. There were hundreds of them landing on his face and flying under his shirt. He was trying really hard to chase them away, but it didn’t really work and, sadly, his crops were badly damaged. AM Elephants eating on a rubbish dump in Oluvil, Sri LankaTharmaplan Tilaxan/Cover Images 22 February One evening, I saw a herd of wild elephants foraging for food in a garbage mound close to the forest bordering the Oluvil-Palakkad area of Sri Lanka. I was aggravated by the sight of the elephants living this way and I wanted to draw attention to their plight by capturing these images. The conditions I was shooting in were tough. Breathing was difficult because of the stench, and I began to develop a skin condition due to spending so much time in the garbage dump. While awareness of elephants eating plastic that has been dumped near their habitat is growing, many Sri Lankans remain unaware, or simply think it’s the government’s responsibility. My hope is that as awareness spreads, a positive change is bound to follow. AM Harry and Meghan arrive at the Endeavour Fund awardsJustin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images 5 March By the time this photo was taken, the rumour that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were departing for Hollywood had been around for a while, so I was hoping to get a picture with a bit of Hollywood glamour. There’s always a bit of luck involved with shooting royals or celebrities because there’s only so much control you have over the environment. For instance, a member of their security team could step in and block the shot and then there’s nothing you can do to move them. People have commented on how magical this photo looks and I think that’s down to the way the rain interacts with the flash to create a dramatic silhouette of the couple. They did indeed leave the UK shortly after, so it was really satisfying to get this shot before they went. AM Goats run wild in deserted Llandudno, WalesChris Furlong/Getty Images 31 March The story broke on Twitter that goats were taking over Llandudno town centre and I went there to try to get some fun pictures. It was like a weird good-news story: animals reinheriting the Earth in the chaos of that early lockdown period. At the time, I was mainly just documenting the emptiness, taking photos of empty streets, empty beaches, empty parks. Getting to photograph those ebullient goats definitely made for a few smiles and a nice break from the monotony of those bleak days. It was really just a case of keeping my distance and letting the goats do their thing. AM  Yasmine Protho graduates in Cusseta, GeorgiaBrynn Anderson/AP 15 May Yasmine and her family all walked in with the image of her on their masks – they’d had them made specially, it was really sweet. Because of Covid restrictions, only 10 students and their families were allowed to be present. The school set up a stage on the football field and all the graduating students had to keep 6ft apart. The stands were completely empty so it was very quiet. When I spoke to Yasmine she said she was excited to graduate, but she also seemed kind of sombre. She looked very beautiful; she’d had her lashes done and I think she wanted people to see who she was with the image on her mask. This was early in the pandemic and there wasn’t as much information as we have now, so I didn’t know what to expect, but it was a very interesting and eerie graduation. LH BLM protester in Atlanta, GeorgiaLynsey Weatherspoon 29 May Being there to document the BLM protests was extremely important to me as a black woman in America. I’ve always gravitated to images that reflect my own identity, and the fact that this image conveys the power of black women in our society is a great source of pride. That was my first time taking photos of a protest and I didn’t know what to expect, but it was really powerful to witness and document. Complete strangers were looking out for each other and I think the emotional significance of that was heightened by the pandemic. When I took the photo I thought it was a cool shot, but it was only when I posted it to Instagram that I realised how powerful the image could be. Da’nai [the woman in the photo] looks like a spiritual figure; I feel like you learn so many things about her, the BLM movement and America when you look at this picture. AM Protests over the killing of George Floyd in MinneapolisPhilip Montgomery 30 May When George Floyd died, it struck me that this community mourning the loss of one of their own was an important moment and I needed to get up to Minneapolis. This photograph was taken in front of the fifth police precinct. The night before, demonstrators had set fire to a number of structures across the street from the police station. The presence of law enforcement was non-existent and, in a lot of ways the police had lost control of the city. However, they would occasionally charge out of the station in full force, in an attempt to clear the area of demonstrators. I remember taking pictures outside the station when there was this wall of teargas and these Hollywood stormtroopers emerged from the smoke. I had covered similar situations in Ferguson and Baltimore, but the police in Minneapolis were taking a real gloves-off approach. For me this photo really speaks to how militarised the police force has become. AM Patrick Hutchinson rescues BLM counter-protesterDylan Martinez/Reuters 14 June This picture was taken at the third or fourth major UK BLM demo in the space of a month. The counter-protesters had advertised that they were going to be around Westminster protecting statues and in the back of my mind I was looking for an opportunity to juxtapose the two sides in one frame. I saw one of the counter–protesters – since identified as Bryn Male – go to the ground and I immediately thought he was in serious danger. Through the fray, I saw another man, Patrick Hutchinson, a BLM protester, dive in and whip him up on to his back before running towards me. It wasn’t just Male – I saw Patrick and his team protecting another three or four people moments later.  Most pictures that resonate with people are heart-wrenching: there’s something about them that draws you in, but they’re never particularly easy to look at. To get two stories together in a positive image like this is quite rare. The stars aligned for me that day. AM Marcus Rashford support in WythenshaweMolly Darlington/Reuters 16 June I saw this sign on social media one evening and I immediately went out to get the shot. I live about 20 minutes away but I knew I couldn’t wait around, because if someone took it down then it would be gone for ever. Once it was taken down, the National Football Museum in Manchester put out a call online for the sign and someone posted it to them anonymously. Marcus Rashford’s campaign was obviously a big story and this picture represents the community of Manchester’s support for him. AM A couple draws guns on protesters in St Louis, MissouriLawrence Bryant/Reuters 29 June People were protesting against the city mayor Lyda Krewson – they wanted her to resign [for revealing the names and addresses of people who called for police reform]. They were marching towards her house when I saw these two people – one on the porch and one on the lawn – pointing guns at the protesters and shouting: “Get out!” I was nervous; I didn’t know their intentions – the woman was angrily shaking the gun and her finger was on the trigger. It felt surreal, to have a person that is angered by you pointing a gun at you, and you don’t even know why. It was mind-boggling.  Plenty of photos just showed the couple, but I really wanted to show who they were pointing the guns at. You can go all the way back in history and you can always see a white person pointing a gun at black people. It’s like nothing has changed. LH Young football fan celebrates Liverpool’s Premier League victoryOli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images 22 July The Champions League celebrations in 2019 were bonkers – 750,000 people lined the streets – but we knew the [Premier League] title celebrations would be different because of Covid. Even though it was during the summer, when many of the lockdown restrictions had been lifted, we had no idea how many people would turn up – but there were thousands of jubilant supporters outside the stadium. I’ve covered Glastonbury a few times and it was a similar atmosphere. What I love about this picture is the raw human emotion. It’s just this little kid celebrating one of the goals [Liverpool beat Chelsea 5-3] and he’s totally oblivious to me and the camera. When someone’s lost in the moment like that, it’s hard to go too far wrong. AM A naked sunbather chases  a wild boar,  Teufelssee lake, BerlinAdele Landauer/AFP/Getty Images 5 August I was swimming at the Teufelssee lake when I saw a boar with her babies eating a discarded pizza. Boars are common here, but my granddaughter lives in LA and I thought she had probably never seen one, so I took out my phone to photograph them. I had the camera ready when I saw the boar grab a yellow bag in her mouth, and then a naked man chasing her – you are allowed to be nude in this area. He was yelling: “Argh, in this bag is my computer!” and clapping his hands in the hope the boar would let it go. I’m a life coach and I thought it was a good example of someone staying focused and doing whatever it takes to achieve their goal. Everyone around was cheering him on, and he was successful in getting the bag back. With his permission I posted the picture online – I expected to get my usual 30 likes, but my daughter called an hour later and said it had gone viral! LH Wildfire and Covid in CaliforniaNoah Berger/AP 19 August I’ve been photographing fires since 2013, but this year has been mind-blowing in terms of the scope of land enveloped in flames and the scale of the devastation. Over one million acres [400,000 hectares] were badly damaged and thousands of people were forced to leave their homes. I spent four or five days out in the field, sleeping in my car, which allowed me to stay immersed in the world I was trying to capture. At this particular fire in Napa County, I spent about an hour and a half with an 84-year-old man and his son who were defending their home. I was looking to photograph something that would signal the location, but this sign gave me an opportunity to combine two major events into one image. In this photo, I see the downward spiral of 2020: you’re worried about this horrible thing and something even worse comes along. AM Lone protester at anti-government demonstrations, BangkokJorge Silva/Reuters 16 October There had been pro-democracy protests in Bangkok all year but I knew this one would be different because they were taking place after the government banned mass gatherings. This meant the police were allowed to employ force to break up groups, which spurred thousands of people into action. I had run back to a higher position to get shots of the police assembled in formation when I saw this man pushing against the barrier on his own. I must have got four or five shots, but within seconds the demonstration was a complete mess, with the police firing water cannons and bodies flying everywhere. The protesters rely heavily on Twitter and this picture was all over Thai social media within a day. AM Dominic Cummings leaves Downing StreetHollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images 13 November I got a call from my editor in the morning saying Cummings’ departure was imminent but spent most of the day waiting around with nothing to shoot. Around 4pm, I started to get anxious because the light was fading but I was determined to get the shot. A little later he just walked out, holding a box. I had pictured it as a wide shot of him by the door, but it came out underexposed, so I decided to follow him down the street. He didn’t seem fazed by the camera, or to even acknowledge it, which in my experience is bizarre. I remember being annoyed that he didn’t turn to face me but I think his silhouette, with the Houses of Parliament in the background, works pretty well. AM Gang members in a cell at Quezaltepeque jail, El SalvadorJosé Cabezas/Reuters 23 November It’s not easy to photograph inside a jail in El Salvador, particularly those full of MS-13 gang members. A month before this photo was taken, [Latin American news site] El Faro alleged that the government had offered gang members benefits like fast food and favourable treatment in exchange for a reduction of violence on the streets. With elections due to take place next year, the government then invited the media in to prove how harsh their treatment of prisoners really was. I had been to the jail in 2012 and was astonished at how bad it smelled and the gang-related graffiti everywhere. This time the jail was still crowded, but it was much cleaner. Every government wants to look tough but, internationally, the reaction to this image was very negative, which I can understand. It seems inhumane to cram thousands of prisoners in like that during a pandemic. AM A  hug through a  Covid safety curtain in São PauloNelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images 13 June I’ve been a photojournalist in São Paulo for 32 years, so I’ve covered big health scares such as Aids and Zika before, but this pandemic is on a different level. I heard about a care home that was using a “cuddle curtain” to allow families to touch their loved ones – many of them had gone months without visitors, and they had begun to complain about how lonely they were. This picture shows Luiza Yassuko, 76, being embraced by her sister-in-law, who visited with her husband, Silvio. It’s been an intense year. I’ve followed the suffering of many people who have been negatively affected by coronavirus, but I’ve also seen people act charitably and with resilience, which has affirmed my faith in the human spirit. AM People pay tribute to Maradona in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaPaula Acunzo/Zuma Press/eyevine 25 November I received a WhatsApp message from a friend saying Maradona was dead. I was in shock and, because of Covid, I didn’t know if it would be possible for people to gather to say goodbye. I decided to go to the Argentinos Juniors club, the first place he played football – the drawing on the wall there is very popular and I knew it would give the picture context. People started to come and cry, giving kisses to the wall – it was so emotional because he represented so much for us. He was a controversial man, but people didn’t see that on this day. They were just sharing their memories and showing pictures they’d taken with Maradona. I’m not a football fan but it was still really sad for me; he’s like a hero. LH  Margaret Keenan becomes the first person in the UK to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine Jacob King/Pool via Reuters 8 December I got to the University Hospital in Coventry at 5.15am and Margaret was vaccinated at around 6.30am. It would have been quite nerve-racking for her, but the nurse put her at ease straight away. I knew this was an important moment, and there was a lot of excitement on the clinical side of things. I took a few pictures of Margaret actually getting the jab, which I quickly filed before taking this image of her being wheeled back to the ward. The nurses were there to applaud her return – it was a really positive atmosphere and you could feel the relief. Even though there’s no glossing over the fact that a lot of people are still dying every day, it was good to see a positive news image, and hopefully the beginning of the return to normality.

"A simple wrought-iron footbridge built by a 19th-century rights of way activist has joined some of the England’s grandest buildings and monuments on the national heritage list. The bridge in Essex was one of 423 additions to the list in 2020, along with an 18th-century smugglers’ shipwreck in Kent; an Italianate villa-style railway station in Nottinghamshire; a water tower in West Yorkshire that can be seen for miles around; and Selfridges department store in London. Historic England on Wednesday published a list of what it called the “most captivating” sites listed this year. Duncan Wilson, chief executive of the government body, said that despite the challenges faced by the heritage sector in 2020 there had been “many brilliant additions” to the list. “From a picturesque footbridge in Essex to an excellently preserved railway station cafe in the Midlands, we want to ensure England’s rich and varied cultural heritage is protected so that the public can continue to cherish the heritage that makes their local places so important.” The footbridge is called Nunn’s bridge and spans the Blackwater River near Coggeshall. It was erected in 1892 by a blacksmith and social campaigner, Henry “Dick” Nunn, who had spent years calling for the replacement of the previous wooden footbridge, which had fallen into decay and washed away. Historic England said the bridge was unique in its design, craftmanship and installation, funded and constructed by Nunn himself. Nunn was well known locally: popular, eccentric and argumentative, he campaigned for the welfare of people and animals as well as being an early advocate of rights of way in the countryside. His activism predates the establishment of the National Trust in 1895 and the Ramblers Association in 1935. The bridge, originally pink, has been given Grade II listing, one of 371 new listing entries to the register. A total of 27 new places have been protected as scheduled monuments including the Old Brig shipwreck at Seasalter in Kent, which was exposed by tides after lying in the mud of the Thames for hundreds of years. Archaeologists think it was probably used by smugglers who operated in the area: the Seasalter coast is known as a place where contraband such as liquor was brought ashore. The remains of the hull, including framing timbers and decking, have been explored and there is potential, Historic England said, “for more exciting finds to be found preserved … which could reveal how the sailors lived on board and what goods the ship was carrying”. Selfridges on Oxford Street, London, has been upgraded from Grade II to Grade II*. The department store was, Historic England said, “key to transforming the British high street at the turn of the 20th century”. The railway station highlighted by Historic England is at Retford in Nottinghamshire. Built between 1891 and 1892 by the Great Northern Railway, it replaced a smaller station unable to cope with the growing volume of passengers. A particularly striking feature is the recently discovered ornate tiling in its dining and refreshment rooms; most other such examples have not survived. It has been listed at Grade II, as has Gawthorpe water tower in West Yorkshire, which was constructed between 1922 and 1928 and used to store drinking water for the village. Known by locals as the “iron giant” it is, say experts, far more interesting than a typical water tower, with panelling that makes it aesthetically pleasing as well as functional.",culture
"The electoral college certified Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election on Monday, which means that “for the 30th time, Donald Trump’s attempts to undo the election have once again finally come to and end”, said Trevor Noah on Tuesday’s Daily Show. With that vote, a constitutional formality reflecting state election results known weeks ago, “even some of [Trump’s] biggest enablers are accepting reality”. On Tuesday, the Republican senators Pat Toomey, John Thune and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, all publicly acknowledged Biden as president-elect. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, also congratulated Biden with a message that reportedly read: “I am ready for interaction and contacts with you.” “Putin doesn’t sound human, he sounds like a self-checkout at a CVS – ‘Ready for interaction. Pleased to place item in the bag,’” Noah joked. “What a weird phrase – ‘I am ready for interaction and contacts with you?’ Sounds like Mike Pence getting frisky. “And you know Trump’s luck has run out now that Mitch McConnell has conceded the election,” Noah continued. “Because forget Putin – if Mitch can’t find a way to subvert American democracy, then it just can’t be done.” In other news, attorney general and longtime Trump stalwart William Barr announced Monday he would step down from the lame-duck administration just five weeks before the Biden transition. The decision “surprised some people”, said Noah, “because for a long time, it seemed like he was ride or die with Trump. He whitewashed the Mueller reports, he protected Trump’s cronies, he even reportedly ordered peaceful protesters to be teargassed just so that Trump could walk over to a church and wave a Bible next to it.” The point is, “these two were like Batman and Robin, if Batman and Robin couldn’t fit into their tights”, Noah joked. Which means only one of two things happened: “Either Barr quit, because Trump is too batshit crazy even for him, or Trump fired Barr because he’s not batshit crazy enough to roll in this White House.” Seeing that the whole Trump White House will be out of a job come 20 January, Noah concluded, “at least Bill Barr is beating the traffic”. With the electoral college certification of Joe Biden’s victory, “some Republicans have been forced to face their biggest fear: reality”, said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. On Tuesday, McConnell “took to the Senate floor and bravely faced a fact”, which is, in his words, that “the electoral college has spoken. So today I want to congratulate President-Elect Joe Biden.” Similarly, the Texas senator John Cornyn told reporters: “There comes a time when you have to realize that despite your best efforts, you’ve been unsuccessful.” “It’s like we tell kids when they play sports,” Colbert mocked. “It is important to realize when you’ve lost, and then six weeks later drive back to the field so you can shake the other team’s hands and say, ‘Good game, you cheater.’” Still, even with the concessions of leading Senate Republicans, “some in the GOP are still struggling to mince words in a way that will appease he who shall not be named”, Colbert explained, such as the Wyoming senator John Barrasso, who called a straightforward question on whether or not Biden was president-elect a “gotcha” question. “Yeah, classic gotcha question,” Colbert deadpanned, “like ‘Who’s the president?’ and ‘What’s your name?’ and ‘What year is it?’ and ‘How many fingers am I holding up?’” Even Putin has acknowledged Trump’s defeat, Colbert continued, and it’s “not a great look for Senate Republicans when the guy who interfered in our election is like, ‘Come on, he won, at a certain point you guys are poisoning democracy.’” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel panned “turtle-faced” McConnell’s belated congratulations to Biden. The Senate majority leader announced Tuesday that “as of this morning, our country has a president-elect” – “as if we hadn’t had one for the 40 more mornings before that”, Kimmel said. Biden’s congratulatory message from “Trump’s KGBFF” Putin that the Russian leader is “ready for cooperation and contacts with you” should be “easy”, Kimmel continued, “because Russia just hacked all of our contacts”. “But wait, if Putin is offering a congratulatory handshake to Joe Biden, then what is Trump eating pellets out of?” he added. Meanwhile, Trump continued to deny the electoral reality, tweeting on Tuesday more baseless claims of election fraud eventually flagged by Twitter as misleading or untrue. “I can’t believe they’re still bothering to put up that little warning under every one of his bogus tweets,” Kimmel said of Twitter’s post-hoc factchecking. “Why not just post a banner at the top of the whole feed that says, ‘This space is condemned?’”",culture
"By any standards it was an epic lunch: the finest soup, jellied trout and rice with prawns, quail stuffed with truffles and foie gras, chicken, beef, duck, asparagus, wonderful Viennese doughnuts, sweet soufflés decorated with gold leaf, and not forgetting tiny songbirds, which are either a luxurious delight, or a gastronomic disgrace. The birds, called ortolans, weigh about an ounce and were hunted and kept in darkness for weeks to fatten up. They were then drowned in Armagnac, roasted and served sizzling to be eaten in a single hedonistic mouthful. The late chef Anthony Bourdain once described eating an ortolan as a “sort of a hot rush of fat, guts, bones, blood and meat … really delicious”. Today ortolan hunting is banned and eating them frowned upon, but in 1890 they were very much on the menu for what ranks as one of Queen Victoria’s favourite meals. The story of the meal is to be told in a new display exploring the history and secrets of the kitchen at one of Britain’s grandest country houses, Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire. Pippa Shirley, head of collections and gardens at Waddesdon, said kitchens were the “unsung heroes” of the UK’s mansions and country estates. “There is just so much more interest now from the public in how these big houses worked, how they ran, so it is nice to be able to discover more,” she said. “Downton [Abbey] has played a huge role, but I also think that people are more interested in their history, if you think of people using Ancestry, or programmes like Who Do You Think You Are?.” Waddesdon’s kitchen was particularly impressive. The house was completed in 1883 as a weekend retreat for one of Britain’s richest men, Lord Ferdinand de Rothschild. It was at Waddesdon, now run by the National Trust, that Rothschild would host his lavish Saturday-to-Monday house parties with the finest food and drink as well, of course, as the Sèvres porcelain to eat off and Gainsboroughs to admire on the walls. In 1890, Victoria came for lunch, arriving at Aylesbury by train from Windsor. The menu for the royal visit is the only one that survived from the time. As was the royal custom, the Queen ate separately from other guests. She was in the main dining room with her daughters while everyone else was in a smaller dining room. The Royal Artillery Band played jolly tunes between the two rooms. Victoria evidently enjoyed herself, with Rothschild later noting: “The royal appetite is proverbial, and it was not until about half past three that the Queen … reappeared.” His butler reported that her majesty had returned to the cold beef for a second helping. The meal made quite an impression on the Queen, Shirley said. “We know that she sent people from Windsor to learn secrets from the Waddesdon kitchen. The standard of cuisine was very, very high.” The menu will go on display along with photographs that curators hope will help fill in gaps in knowledge about the people who worked in the kitchen. “We have rather less information than you might imagine about the staff here, and it would be nice to know more about the servants and their lives,” Shirley said. A grainy black and white photograph, taken around 1900, shows how accurately the Waddesdon kitchen was restored in the 1990s, but curators would love to know who the people gathered round the table are. Rothschild died in 1898 and the running of the house was passed to his sister Alice. Catherine Taylor, Waddesdon’s head archivist, said she was fairly certain Alice’s chef at the time was a Monsieur Bonnar, of whom very little is known apart from he died in a car accident in Brighton in 1915. According to the scant records which do exist, other kitchen staff members were called Annie Gough, Susan Smith, Susan Cole and Fanny Sams. Taylor said: “If you have been researching your family history or know of ancestors who worked at the manor at this time, we’d be delighted if you got in touch. Especially if you have any old family photos that may help us to identify the individual members of our turn-of-the century kitchen brigade.”",culture
"Born in 1965, Gretchen Rubin is a bestselling author and speaker who grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. Best known for writing on the themes of happiness and wellbeing, she published The Happiness Project in 2009 and, most recently, Outer Order, Inner Calm in 2019. Her podcast, Happier With Gretchen, which she co-hosts with her sister Elizabeth Craft, has won several awards, including a Webby earlier this year. She lives in New York with her husband and two daughters.  Mule Skinner Blues by Dolly Parton I came across it randomly, this old, almost yodelling song covered by Dolly Parton in 1970. It’s a country classic and has this refrain of “hey hey” – If you need a lift, it will make you happy. I love Dolly Parton. I feel like she’s one of the few universals. All of the books that she’s donated over the years for her Imagination Library… She’s done so much for the people of her state and country – and now the world with her donations to vaccine research. She’s a secular saint, in a way. Twenty Thousand Hertz One of the ways I work off my restless energy from all the Zoom meetings and not travelling is by going for long walks in Central Park while listening to a terrific podcast. I’m loving this one. Beautifully produced, it’s all about the power of hearing, exploring noise pollution, special effects in movies and so on… It really awakened my sense of hearing and my appreciation of the auditory world, and made me much more aware. Wild Seed by Octavia E Butler Nothing makes me happier than coming across an exciting new author. I love science fiction, and I discovered Octavia E Butler this year. Wild Seed is the first [chronologically] in her Patternist series. It’s sci-fi fantasy and makes you think about human nature and history. The four books cover freedom, control, science, history – all the big themes. Some are about enslavement, others mind-control, and alien species controlling another species. Each can stand alone, but I read them all, and in the preferred order. Russian Doll (Netflix) This is a comedy-drama about the meaning of life and relationships. The main character is a game developer who keeps dying and reliving her 36th birthday and slowly begins to understand her own life. It sounds like the story would quickly run out of steam, but they’ve figured out a way to explode it open that’s really surprising. Natasha Lyonne stars, and created it with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland, an eminent creative team. It’s just very thought-provoking and incredibly binge-able – I loved it so much I watched it twice! Metropolitan Museum of Art At the start of 2020, I decided I was going to visit the Met every single day. And I did that until it shut down in March because of Covid, but now it’s open again – only five days a week and with cut-back hours but it feels like such a treat after not being able to go for so long. They’re very careful about making sure people don’t crowd. It’s their 150th anniversary and this was supposed to be a huge year of celebration, with the show Making the Met 1870-2020, full of all the greatest hits. Hunger by Roxane Gay This is American writer Roxane Gay’s memoir about her relationship with her weight and it’s so searching it really makes you think about your own identity, expression and relationships. Gay’s struggle with her weight has been an important element in her life and identity. The book looks at that and also tries to understand her childhood. Gay has such a powerful voice. I have read a couple of things by her, and I follow her on Twitter, where she’s hilarious, but I feel like this one went the deepest. It’s a super compelling read.",culture
"Chantal Joffe is an American-born British painter. She completed an MA at the Royal College of Art in 1994 and her work has been shown at the National Portrait Gallery and Saatchi Gallery in London, and the Jewish Museum in New York. Joffe’s large-scale paintings mainly depict women and children, and includes many self-portraits. In 2018, she painted herself each day as she went through a divorce and, in 2019, she created the series Pictures of What I Did Not See, which captured a traumatic illness. Her latest show, Story, focuses on ageing and motherhood and will open at Victoria Miro Gallery, London N1, when restrictions are lifted. Tate Britain winter commission Remembering a Brave New World by Chila Kumari Singh Burman cheered me up when I saw it on a grey December morning. It’s great to see the dour facade of Tate Britain covered in bright lights, eyes, an elephant and an ice-cream truck – eclectic, electric gaiety shining out. It’s beautiful and original, and so much more exciting than a stodgy Christmas tree. Go and see it if you live in London – it’s truly a festival of light and can still be enjoyed in our new lockdown reality. Towpath Cafe, London This restaurant on the canal near the Kingsland Road bridge in east London managed to be open for a bit this autumn. It’s in a lockup that opens on to the canal, with green metal tables in the open air. It’s my favourite restaurant. The food changes but in the morning you can always have porridge with walnuts or fried eggs on toast. It’s run by Lori and the chef is Laura and it’s the most beautiful place to eat food like you wish you could make at home yourself, only much better. Great Women Artists Art historian Katy Hessel’s Great Women Artists podcast about the sculptor Alina Szapocznikow was great. She had a conversation with art historian Griselda Pollock, who spoke with such a passion, I had to see the work. Szapocznikow makes strange body casts, sections of torsos, and when Pollock made me aware of her history as a Holocaust survivor, the trauma in the work made so much sense. The work is somewhere between Eva Hesse and Louise Bourgeois. We Are Who We Are (BBC Three) We Are Who We Are took me a while to get into: the pace is slow and I had to concentrate quite hard to understand what was happening. It’s set on an American army base in northern Italy and is mainly about the teenagers that live there and how they interact with the Italian teenagers. In a funny way it does for a new generation what A Room With a View did for mine: it romanticises what it is to be a young visitor in Italy. Even though it’s a much more modern view, there’s something about Italy itself that steals the show for me: glimpses of Venice, the small coffee bars, even the buses – maybe an attitude to love and relationships. Anyway, I’m completely gripped. Everybody by Olivia Laing The new book, Everybody, by my friend Olivia Laing is out this April. It’s a ride through the history of protest and change in the 20th century with Wilhelm Reich as the guide. I love how Laing presents the movements, and the writers, artists and thinkers who were involved in them, and brings them to life without ever judging them. Andrea Dworkin, Sontag, Malcolm X, Freud – they speak to us and come alive again, but we aren’t asked to decide if they are good or bad; we can listen to their thoughts and ideas. It’s a revelation in an age when we seem endlessly to judge and condemn our artists and thinkers. Artemisia Gentileschi, National Gallery, London  For my final choice I am torn between two exhibitions that I loved – Artemisia Gentileschi and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye at Tate Britain, both of which felt radical and exciting. The Artemisia reduced me almost to tears. The sense of her courage, those extraordinary Judith of Holofernes paintings where she seems almost to be cutting off his head while giving birth to him. Art school memories of always being taught an all-male canon came back to me. The self-portraits where she literally paints herself into art history made me want to cry and shout and scream. Yiadom-Boakye’s show was exhilarating. Large, paintings gleaming on the walls, full of energy and mystery – they made me excited to see them.",culture
"Dance schools are expecting to see an increase in men of a certain age signing up for lessons after the soul-stirring Strictly success of Bill Bailey. The comedian, 55, was named winner of the show on Saturday, triumphing over contestants who were less than half his age. On Monday, Bailey said he hoped his example would inspire men. “I think a lot of blokes of my vintage do feel self-conscious on the dancefloor,” he said in an interview on ITV’s Lorraine presented by his fellow contestant Ranvir Singh. “We are always aware of that term ‘dad dancers’ and that makes people feel a bit nervous and, ‘Oh, I don’t want to be that guy shuffling around at the end of the night’. My hope is that me having this success will mean more men of my age might consider taking up a dance class, or maybe just getting fitter, or whatever.” Dance schools said they had already seen an effect and expect that to accelerate when they are allowed to reopen properly. Damiano Soldati, of the Dance Lab in south London, said he had noticed more people of Bailey’s age signing up for beginners’ lessons “and they all talk about Strictly”. His partner, Laura Fox, said it had been great to see Bailey not only win, but deserving to win. “In a dance competition, we have age categories so you would never get an 18-year-old dancing against a 55-year-old. His quickstep … there is nobody in our classes that does it as well as he does. He really does have a talent and what’s good about Bill is that he shows you don’t have to be a specific type of person to do ballroom and Latin. You can like heavy metal but still like to waltz.” Wiecke Eringa, the CEO and artistic director of Yorkshire Dance, said: “It is just fantastic, isn’t it, that someone who doesn’t look a dancer can win, to have an older man showing just the sheer joy of it. I do hope that means dad dancing will become a thing of the past.” Ballroom dance was so much more than glitz and sequins, she said. “I hope this will inspire men to give it a go because it is so good for your health and your relationships and it is so much fun.” She said Bailey confounded expectations about older people and “that is something we as an organisation are massively into. What is beautiful? What is sexy? It can be so much more than what the mainstream would have you believe.” Tracie Gooch, of Tracie’s Latin Club in Southampton, said: “I think it will definitely inspire men and I think we’ll see it more in January.” Already there were older women buying online beginners’ dance lessons for their husbands for Christmas. “I am sure there are people out there that have bought and looked online for dance classes because of Bill Bailey.” She said everyone she knew had been rooting for Bailey after his “phenomenal” quickstep in week two. The younger contestants, Hrvy and Maisie Smith, were stronger dancers – but Bailey captured “imaginations and hearts” she said. All dance schools have had a rollercoaster year of being open with reduced numbers and then closed offering lessons on Zoom and prerecords. “Who knows what the new year will bring but we’re now ready for everything,” said Gooch.",culture
"Barney Bubbles was once described as the “missing link between pop and culture” producing record sleeves, T-shirts and stage sets for the likes of Hawkwind, Elvis Costello, Ian Dury and Nick Lowe. He also directed the 1981 video for the Specials song Ghost Town, featuring the band glumly crammed into a 1961 Vauxhall Cresta being driven through the empty streets of London. On Monday, it will be announced that an archive of Bubbles’ work is now owned by the UK public, as part of a list of treasures by artists including Manet, Rembrandt and Chagall which are going into public collections thanks to the UK’s cultural gifts and acceptance in lieu (AiL) schemes. The latter scheme, created in Lloyd George’s 1910 “people’s budget”, allows cultural objects be left to the UK as a way of offsetting or settling inheritance tax bills. The cultural gifts scheme was introduced in 2013, and allows people to leave treasures in their lifetime. The 2019-20 year was a record one, an annual report reveals, with objects worth nearly £65m left to the public, settling tax of £40m. The Belinda Syme archive of Bubbles’ work and paraphernalia was comparatively small in terms of tax settlement (£16,500) but it is arguably one of the most fascinating collections on the list, shining light on a figure who his many fans say deserves to be better known. Born Colin Fulcher, Bubbles produced distinctive designs in the 70s and 80s for a huge swathe of punk, post-punk and new wave acts. He also designed the masthead for NME and the archer logo for Strongbow cider. The science fiction writer Michael Moorcock described Bubbles’ record covers as “lasting images for fleeting times” while Factory Records designer Peter Saville called him the “missing link between pop and culture.” Bubbles rarely signed anything he produced, shunned publicity – apart from an interview with The Face – and took his own life in 1983, aged just 41. The archive includes sketchbooks, drawing equipment, collages, photographs, badges, stickers, album covers and his library of reference books. It has been permanently allocated to Liverpool John Moores University in accordance with the wish of the donor. Edward Harley, chair of the AiL panel, said two-thirds of allocations had been made to institutions outside London. “The variety of objects remains as diverse as ever, and it is particularly exciting that the number of institutions receiving items through the scheme continues to grow.” Harley also highlighted significant acquisitions made to national museums in devolved nations. Wales has received an important Manet portrait of his cousin Jules Dejouy and a Corot landscape; Scotland a gouache titled L’Écuyère (The Horse Rider) by Marc Chagall; Northern Ireland six etchings by Rembrandt. Paintings by Leonard Rosoman that include the first gay kiss in British theatre history have been allocated to the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, West Sussex. Other archives now owned publicly include those of Lord Carrington, foreign secretary under Margaret Thatcher, which has gone to the Churchill Archives Centre; and barrister Jeremy Hutchinson, who defended Penguin in the Lady Chatterley’s Lover trial, which has gone to the University of Sussex. The annual report reveals that this is the first year that the maximum amount of tax which can be settled, £40m, was utilised. Among the more eclectic objects left is a collection of more than 50 fossils found in a West Lothian quarry which includes Westlothiana lizziae – or “Lizzie the Lizard” – thought to be the oldest known reptile. The collection was allocated to National Museums Scotland.",culture
"A chill wind is blowing through Sydney’s theatres this week, with major productions cancelled in the wake of the Covid lockdown on Sydney’s northern beaches and the city-wide outbreak which has so far infected 90 people. The freeze is on for Disney’s Frozen, which has cancelled all scheduled performances up to the planned Christmas closure on 23 December. Prior to this announcement, made on Monday, the show played to in excess of 1,700 people per performance, under the NSW Health Department exemption for performing arts venues. Frozen is hoping to reopen on 26 December. Magic Mike Live did not open in the Entertainment Quarter in Sydney’s Moore Park on 20 December as advertised; instead, its producers hope to reopen on 27 December. The musical Pippin, which has been playing at the Lyric Theatre, has also closed its doors until 27 December “out of an abundance of caution”, said Graeme Kearns, the CEO of Foundation Theatres which operates the Capitol and Lyric Theatres. “It’s been a rough few days,” Kearns said. “The venues asked all patrons from the northern beaches not to attend the theatres over the weekend and relocated a small number of staff from the northern beaches into the city. “I think we have broken a lot of hearts and for that I am sorry,” Kearns said. “But it was the socially responsible thing to do. We want to do our part for NSW health and safety.” Christmas is a time when family groups come to the theatre, often for the first time, said Kearns. “It’s one of the great strengths of Sydney; families really come out for shows pre-Christmas, but I can assure people we have the capacity to reschedule tickets so they can come again soon. We know clusters can pop up and we are ready for that.” At the time of writing, Sydney Theatre Company’s (STC) production of The Picture of Dorian Gray in the Roslyn Packer Theatre is going ahead as advertised, with the reduced capacity of 75% – or 672 seats – mandated by the current NSW Health exemptions for some theatres. The production is a one-woman show starring Eryn Jean Norvill playing 26 different characters. The Roslyn Packer Theatre has maintained strict protocols: Covid marshals ensure all audience members are signed in with a QR code and no one can enter the theatre unmasked. Foyer bars are closed and ushers enforce mask-wearing during the show. Last weekend’s performances of My Brilliant Career at Belvoir theatre were cancelled due to uncertainty about the cluster. But a show is resuming on Tuesday and Wednesday night at 75% capacity – with masks mandatory – before a scheduled break until 29 December. Belvoir asks its audiences to bring their own mask and wear it at all times while in the building. The theatre’s bars are open, however, and guests are allowed to “raise” their masks while drinking. “Belvoir is a small theatre, and we have a Department of Health exemption for 75% maximum capacity although we’ve elected to run at a lower capacity for the next couple of weeks,” said Sue Donnelly, executive director at Belvoir. “This allows for social distancing in our theatre and foyer. Belvoir has strong Covid-safe policies, including being the first theatre to announce that masks would be mandatory.” Both Belvoir and STC are refunding or exchanging tickets to any patrons who reside in or have visited the northern beaches recently, in line with NSW state guidelines for self-isolation.  The recent outbreak serves to remind theatre producers that their business model sits on a knife edge. Quick lockdowns of entire local government areas can seriously impact audience numbers and send box office staff into frenzied rebooking. Worse still, cast and crew can suddenly find themselves on the other side of a line that can’t be crossed. Among those most concerned with the immediate future will be Opera Australia, which plans to open its production of The Merry Widow on 5 January, and Sydney festival 2021, whose productions – all locally sourced due to the pandemic – open in venues across Sydney from 6 January. Across Sydney, it will be a quieter-than-usual festive season. Citing NSW Health advice, City of Sydney has cancelled all live music and pop-up shows, including roving Christmas-themed performances in the city centre and the daily light shows around the Christmas tree in Martin Place. The tree remains in place. Christmas is not entirely cancelled.",culture
"Late-night hosts returned to the air on Monday evening for the new year, although 2021 was already looking a lot like the 2020 mess just left behind. “We’re off to a fresh start,” joked Stephen Colbert on the Late Show, “with a raging pandemic and a president who’s trying to steal the election”. “Turns out 2020 is dropping some bonus tracks,” he added, as on Sunday the Washington Post released a recording of a phone call between the president and Georgia’s secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, who oversaw the state’s election, recount and recount of the recount. During the hour-long call, which took place on Saturday, Trump explicitly demanded Raffensperger “find” 11,000 votes to overturn Biden’s victory in the state, invoked numerous conspiracy theories, and threatened criminal charges against Raffensperger if he did not assist the president in his attempt to nullify the election. “Buckle up everybody, because this call is like if Watergate and the Ukraine scandal had a baby that they made on the Access Hollywood bus,” Colbert joked. “When you’re a star, they let you do it!” While the call was ominous – the president pleaded with a state official and his lawyers “fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break” – the contents were often nonsensical and rambling. “If he wants to steal an election he really needs to sound less like your grandpa complaining about his phone,” Colbert joked. New year, same old conflicts in Washington, reported Seth Meyers on Monday night, as House Republicans and a dozen GOP senators prepared to vote symbolically to refuse to certify the election results. “Virtually the entirety of the Republican party has started off the year by making it clear, in case it wasn’t clear before, that they’re actively trying to destroy democracy,” the Late Night host explained. “Also this story is yet another reminder that while we do a big countdown and watch a ball drop, the beginning of new years tend to be a lot like the year that just ended.” “Predictably, 2021 is picking up right where 2020 left off, with the Republican party callously refusing to do anything about the raging pandemic that’s killed 350,000 Americans or the botched vaccine rollout, choosing instead to focus on their unhinged attempts to light our democracy on fire,” Meyers added, before diving into the Trump-Raffensperger call. Though congressional Republicans such as senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley have claimed election integrity as the reason for sustaining Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud, “with this call to Raffensperger, Trump ripped off the mask and revealed what’s really going on,” Meyers said. “He made it crystal clear exactly what those 140 GOP House members and a dozen senators will be supporting on Wednesday. They’re not standing up for election integrity or trying to restore faith in our democracy, they’re petty henchmen in a harebrained scheme to steal an election hatched by a deranged wannabe tyrant who talks like a mafia boss with a head injury.” During the hour-long call, Trump threatened Raffensperger with criminal charges and invoked numerous debunked election conspiracy theories. “I just like to imagine what everyone else was doing on the other end of the phone call while Trump was rambling like a lunatic for an hour,” Meyers said. “It’s like when you put your grandpa on speaker phone while you do household chores and then he just casually confesses to a crime in the middle.” “While most of us are back to reality today, Donald Trump is further from it than he’s ever been,” Jimmy Kimmel said on Monday night, referencing the Raffensperger call. “I listened it to it twice,” he said, “I listened to the whole thing like it was a surprise Taylor Swift album.” During the call, the president “tried everything”, Kimmel said. “He bragged, he challenged, he threatened, he told the secretary of state he’d come to Georgia and eat all their peaches, nothing. “He really is the weakest, whiniest little dictator imaginable,” he added. “If you haven’t listened to it, listen to it, it’s pathetic.” And yet, numerous congressional Republicans intend to vote in favor of Trump’s attempt to overturn democracy this week, citing baseless election fraud claims. “During his last ‘perfect call’ – the one he got impeached for – Republicans lined up and said ‘we can’t impeach, Congress shouldn’t decide who’s president, the people should decide!’” Kimmel said. “And now these same Congress people are like, ‘what, the people decided on Biden? In that case, let’s let Congress decide who’s the president.’”",culture
"Once upon a time, in the old, old days when the mouse was a barber, and the donkey ran errands, and the tortoise baked bread, there was a great mountain called Kaf Daği on the border of the spirit realm, from which many of the fairytales and myths of the Middle East sprang forth. Today, Kaf Daği is thought to be somewhere in the Caucasus mountain range that separates the Black Sea from the Caspian. In this magical place – also known as Jabal Qaf in Arabic and Kuh-e Qaf in Persian – princes are cursed by witches, who turn them into stags; beautiful maidens are birthed from oranges; and sultans, courtiers, slaves and farmers alike are at the mercy of the peri (fairies) and ifrit (demons) that populate the Turkish fairyland. The oral folktales of the Anatolian plateau are a remarkable blend of storytelling motifs and traditions, drawing on the Arabian Nights and Brothers Grimm, as well as Kurdish, Persian, Slavonic, Jewish and Romanian influences. Dr Ignatuis Kunos, a Hungarian Turkologist who was one of the first academics to collect and write some of them down in the 1880s, compared the treasures of Turkish folklore to “precious stones lying neglected in the byways of philology for want of gleaners to gather them in”. He worried that the steady creep of modernisation – particularly the railway – would erode Anatolia’s cultural heritage. Happily, more than a century later, the oral storytelling tradition has survived, and a mammoth academic project called Masal is collecting and indexing a goal of 10,000 stories to preserve for future generations. Members of the public and academics from university literature departments around the country can submit a fairytale to Masal’s online portal, where it is then examined by three rounds of researchers and language editors. The project is funded by the Atatürk Cultural Centre in what is the first undertaking of its kind in Turkey. The stories are indexed according to which of seven regions they are from and which of five different types of stories: animal tales, magical or extraordinary tales, realistic tales and humorous tales. Zincirlemeli tales follow a strict formula, almost like a poem, in which characters and events at the beginning and end form mirror images. There are often several different variants of one story, requiring painstaking cross-referencing to figure out how a tale can differ over time from one region to another: there are 20 different versions of Tın Tın Kabacık, about two little girls abandoned by their father, in the province of Muğla alone. Many stories and poems over the years have morphed into Turkish from original Kurdish, Laz, Armenian and Circassian versions. If a submitted tale is approved it becomes part of Masal’s online database, which will eventually be available to the public. More than 3,300 tales have been collected from 77 different areas to date, and the project’s directors hope the corpus will be completed by February 2022. Motifs such as magic carpets, animals and birds gifted with speech and enchanted mirrors, apples and pomegranates echo throughout the canon. Characters who brave the dragons and giants of Kaf Daği or survive a trek across the desert are rewarded with marriage proposals in beautiful gardens, and the phoenix-like Zumrutu Anka or Simurgh bird is always on hand to help a hero out of a tight spot. The tales can be ugly, too. Black or Moorish servants, Jews and elderly witches almost always take the part of the villain; pashas have their innocent wives stoned to death and enemies ripped apart by wild horses; a sparrow comes to tell a young woman that death is her kismet (fate). Turkish fairytales also took on an important political dimension during the early days of the republic, when modern Turkey’s founder, Mustafa Kamal Atatürk, attempted to force what was left of the Ottoman empire into the modern world. Folk culture was rejected as backwards, and Turkish scholars such as Pertev Naili Boratav, who pioneered the study of folktales, became a target of Turkish nationalists in the 1940s for highlighting the country’s ethnic diversity in his work. “Boratav’s meticulous scholarship and courageous public intellectualism inspired me,” said author Kaya Genç, whose book The Lion and the Nightingale criss-crosses modern Turkey in an examination of the “contradictory soul of the Turkish nation”. “In folk tales, the heroes are mostly outsiders who suffer the violence of powerful autocrats; for politicians, their defiant tone is dangerous,” he said. Dr Mehmet Naci Önal, a lecturer at Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University’s department of Turkish language and literature, who serves as one of Masal’s researchers, hopes that academics, writers and artists will be able to draw on the project’s database of stories for generations to come. “Fairytales teach us to wonder, to use reason, to be patient, to dream, to overcome obstacles, not to be intimidated, to struggle, to be good people, to fight against evil, to tell the truth, to detect lies and deceit, to resist, and to listen. These values are universal human values: times change, people don’t.”",culture
"Every Christmas, after the ham’s been carved and everyone’s stopped fighting, people all over the world sit down to watch people fight all over again in the iconic festive action film Die Hard.

Instead, I’m dreaming of a white, muscular, mountainous Christmas, courtesy of the Sylvester Stallone mountain climbing action film Cliffhanger. Sure, it’s not technically set during the holidays – but there is a lot of snow (which according to the giant inflatable snowman on my street still has festive connotations, even in Australia), and it does have some explosive Christmas sentiment. For me, that’s enough. In Cliffhanger, which is streaming in Australia on Stan, Stallone plays experienced mountain climber Gabe Walker, who actually only walks in one scene. Generally he’s ... hanging, and climbing rocks, really fast. When we meet him, he’s clambering up an intimidating slab of rock to rescue his mate and his mate’s girlfriend Sarah, who has inexplicably carried a small puppy soft toy all the way to the top of a big stone pillar. With its boneless padded body, the puppy looks better equipped than Sarah for what’s about to happen – namely Stallone and his worthless, ripped biceps dropping them down a vast geological expanse, to die at the base of an oversized tombstone. The traumatised Stallone abandons his grieving friends and girlfriend for a few months, before being lured back by the idea of taking her with him down a shame spiral. Soon though, a bunch of baddies botch a mid-flight heist and he’s roped into tracking down $100m stuffed into suitcases littered across Colorado’s Rocky Mountains – played here by the Italian Alps, which are significantly more expressive than Stallone. The film is all action. There’s truly excellent stunt work, including a guy climbing along a wire between two planes without a harness (allegedly the most expensive stunt of all time, at US $1m), and Stallone doing one of those classic runs along an exploding rope bridge. There’s also mind-bendingly dumb-but-great fight scenes. At one point Stallone manages to lift up a baddie and impale him on a blunt stalactite; and at another he goes full Kill Runnings and repeatedly punches one henchman in the head while simultaneously using the man as a bobsleigh. There’s also a really dramatic bat cave scene, which isn’t scary because bats are actually quite cute. A couple of deaths that raise the stakes are a real bummer – particularly the old mountain rescue guy who likes doing abstract paintings of monkeys (I guess he just likes things that climb good?) and there’s lots of blood-splattered snow. The only reprieve from this ridiculous testosterone avalanche is John Lithgow who, playing the film’s villain Qualen, manages to chew enough snow-covered scenery to give himself brain freeze. As well as being a solid entry to the canon of British-accented evil masterminds, Qualen embodies the same egotistical rich guy disregard for human life displayed in the currently streaming, mountaineering documentaries Free Solo, Mountain and The Summit. Those films focus on (mostly) dudes, whose lust for conquest and disregard for the awesome power of nature frequently claims their own lives, as well as those of their loved ones and exploited sherpas. In this context, Qualen’s suitcases full of money are metaphors for the folly of spending squillions of dollars to line up and take selfies at the top of big, terrifying hills. Which makes it especially satisfying to watch Stallone blow up Qualen and his luggage. No Cliffhanger isn’t set at Christmas like Die Hard. But the way Qualen and his henchmen recklessly charge around the mountain looking for big expensive boxes feels analogous to the Christmas shopping rush, which has claimed the lives and sanity of many. And at the end of the film, after all the suitcases full of money have been destroyed and Stallone has found reconciliation with his old friends and guilt, it’s apparent that all that really matters is holding onto the people you love, rather than dropping them off a cliff. Maybe Cliffhanger is a Christmas film after all.",culture
"The Black Country Living Museum is an open-air attraction that tells the story of Britain’s early manufacturing history, set in the defiantly unstarry town of Dudley, in England’s industrial Midlands. Among the exhibits that have earned it a clutch of awards are two mine shafts, a lime kiln and a collection of postwar trolley buses. This month the visitor attraction gained another, more unexpected accolade, becoming – it believes – the most popular museum in the world on TikTok. It has more than 350,000 followers worldwide, and its short video clips, often featuring a cast of re-enactors in historic dress, can attract many more viewers. A recent video featuring a character called “1920s grandad” offering advice in a tar-thick Black Country accent has been viewed more than 2.2m times. “My favourite TikTok account giving me LIFE right now,” reads one of the clip’s almost 12,000 comments. For the hard-pressed heritage sector, struggling perennially to attract younger visitors and this year reeling from on-off Covid-related closure, this level of engagement with a new audience represents a kind of alchemy. Abby Bird, the museum’s communications manager, admits she had no expectation of such popularity when she launched the TikTok account in late August. “I remember thinking I would be really happy if we got 10,000 followers by Christmas,” she says. In fact, she cleared that hurdle after only her second post, a video of some of the museum’s actors strutting through its historic streets to a booming K-pop soundtrack, in parody of a street-style meme popular on the site. The museum has been named one of TikTok’s 100 top UK accounts for 2020, and after extensive searching, Bird can find no other museum in the world with more followers. The push to get on TikTok, she says, was lockdown itself, when the museum’s reduced schedule left her with some free time. Bird, 31, is a self-confessed TikTok addict, but not all her colleagues got it at first. “Once I explained the process to senior staff, they were very much like: ‘Well I don’t really understand how it works, and I don’t use it personally, but I trust you.’ Part of us being accessible as a museum is being in the spaces that young people are digitally.” That challenge is well understood by Adam Koszary, who had a brief and surreal moment of internet celebrity in 2018 when he was social media manager of the Museum of Rural English Life. One of his tweets, featuring an impressively proportioned sheep, became such a huge global meme that the billionaire Tesla-founder, Elon Musk, briefly changed his profile picture to that of the museum. Now in charge of social media for the Royal Academy in London, Koszary frequently advises other museums and galleries seeking to make their communications more effective. It is ironic, he says, that despite being in the business of telling stories, many “are still playing catchup to social media in a ton of ways. Even if they have massive followings, they’re still not quite connecting.” Both he and Bird agree that the key is in what Koszary calls “meeting the internet halfway”, taking time to discover what works on different platforms, and committing the resources to make the institution’s content and tone translate to that medium. That won’t always mean a sassy riff on viral memes, though the Yorkshire Museum has kicked off a lively Twitter dialogue by challenging other institutions to regular “curator battles” in which they are invited to link to items from their collections. Koszary points to the National Trust as an institution that has done “an amazing job” balancing its members’ interest in nature and history with the need to communicate its properties’ sometimes controversial backstories. The question is how to translate a viral following on social media into real value. “I suppose it really depends on how you define success as a museum,” says Bird. “Just because our doors are closed at the moment, that doesn’t mean our job stops. We’re focusing on visits to the website, conversations happening, the number of comments – all of those are really important indicators that people are taking in the story. And I have absolute confidence that that is going to lead to more visits.”",culture
"Digital-only performances and live streaming to a virtual audience are set to become a permanent feature of the live performance landscape, long after the Covid-19 pandemic comes under control, and leading the way in this new era of post-pandemic art is a new gallery and live performance space in Sydney’s inner city suburb of Chippendale. Phoenix Central Park was conceived and funded by philanthropist Judith Neilson, the founder and owner of Sydney’s White Rabbit gallery, which houses one of the largest collections in the world of contemporary Chinese art. With daughter Beau Neilson as Phoenix’s creative director, the new project, just a few streets away from White Rabbit, continues the family’s commitment to providing creative experiences in the visual and performing arts to the public, free of charge. Beau Neilson told Guardian Australia Phoenix’s ongoing operations would be wholly funded by the Judith Neilson Foundation, with no funding from government sources; a financial model highly unusual in the heavily subsided Australian cultural landscape. Neilson admits the logistics of offering free performances to the public once venues return to 100% capacity have not yet been fully determined. “I think there are a few different ways we can do it,” she said. “We’re looking at having multiple sessions in an evening – we would still film a component of [the performance] but we will have small audiences, so there might be a six o’clock session for example a nine o’clock session. “We’re also looking at some walkthrough performances, where audiences could walk through the space and experience different things in different parts of the space, where we could ensure we could manage a steady flow. “But we’re still working on the practical elements of the details of making all this possible.” The doors to Phoenix opened in February 2020 with a performance by experimental music group Ensemble Offspring, then promptly closed as the nation began the Covid-19 shutdown. The project has since filmed a number of Covid-safe audience-free performances and posted them on its YouTube channel. “At the point restrictions came into place, we were still finding our feet,” said Neilson. “But within a matter of days, we had embraced the full digital possibilities of the space, which, fortuitously, had been considered as part of the building’s design.” Live audiences are not expected to walk through the venue’s doors again until mid-2021 (Guardian Australia visited it by invitation). But Phoenix’s function and design, which has already collected a slew of architecture awards, has been built around the assumption that performance spaces of the future must be pandemic-proof. Sophisticated technology to produce high-quality digital and live streaming performances has been embedded into the building’s finely sculpted bones. It is this principle – that resilience is not enough to ensure future crises will not bring the cultural economy to its knees – that was touched on during a parliamentary inquiry hearing into Australia’s creative and cultural industries and institutions in Canberra last November. “This is not just about resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same, whereas anti-fragile gets better,” said Kate Fielding, the program director for independent arts and cultural think tank A New Approach, at the inquiry. “When we talk about anti-fragile, we’re talking about those things which benefit from disruption – that is, they thrive in disruption. They are nimble and responsive and able to adapt to a situation.” The complex, which reportedly cost $32m to build before a single art work was installed (Neilson would not confirm the building’s cost) earned its designers, Durbach Block Jaggers and John Wardle Architects a number of national and international architectural prizes, including the prestigious NSW Architecture Medallion. On Friday, Phoenix Central Park will mark its shift back into semi-normal mode, with the digital premiere of a new Sydney Dance Company (SDC) work commissioned by the gallery and choreographed by Rafael Bonachela. The work, Touch, not only celebrates the first time SDC artists have been allowed to make physical contact with each other in nine months, but also serves as a virtual tour of the buildings’ interiors, which are based on the German concept of “gesamtkunstwerk” – that is, a total work of art. The stairwells, dressing rooms, car park and basement, as well as the auditorium with its soaring bell-shaped ceiling have all become sets in the SDC’s short production. “Phoenix is an inspirational space, which embodies the nexus between architecture and creativity,” said SDC’s creative director Bonachela. “Working with the Sydney Dance Company dancers to bring to life a creative response to Phoenix Central Park was a delight. Contemporary dance reflects the new, the future, the vanguard and it was incredible to have the opportunity to make a short film driven by the sinuous lines and surprises around each corner of this breathtaking building.”",culture
"Jason Williamson, lead vocalist of English electronic punk music duo Sleaford Mods, was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire in 1970. He moved to Nottingham in 1995, where he began working with rock band Spiritualized and electronic duo Bent. In 2009, he met Andrew Fearn and they released the first Sleaford Mods album, Divide and Exit, in 2014. They have since been called “the voice of Britain” by their fans and “the world’s greatest rock’n’roll band” by Iggy Pop. Their latest album, Spare Ribs, is out now on Rough Trade Records. The band will tour the UK in late 2021.  Over three episodes, this series talks about Rupert Murdoch’s rise and fall, including that massive scandal with Rebekah Brooks. It also looks at the inauguration of Tony Blair into the fold. Murdoch didn’t usually go with [people] perceived to be socialist leaders, so I thought that part was interesting. We now know Blair is very much a centrist, but this series covered his initial invitation to a Murdoch party. It was powerful, the way it showed footage of Blair stepping on to a boat, and there was no going back. It’s really interesting to see how power influences modern politics. It’s about Lanegan’s life, his childhood, the history of his band Screaming Trees, and the eventual heroin affliction that he went through. I wasn’t really a massive fan of the band, but the book is really good. It calmly and matter-of-factly hammers out the experience of a heroin addict. It also paints the scene of the early days of grunge in Seattle, which was really interesting and struck a chord. I connect with the idea of people having a hard time trying to get somewhere, and being affected by childhood trauma. [The book is] a realistic portrayal of someone trying to get somewhere in music. I can’t live without it, to be honest. I’ve tried toast – it’s no good. My mum made it better than my dad. My dad was terrible. He would just boil it. My partner does the same. You just put it in a pot and stir it slowly over a low heat until it thickens. I use oat milk. It’s got to have set, thick honey in it too. I need it to operate: I clean everyone’s room and get all the kids’ clothes out, and you need a bellyful of something. I’m bang into her at the minute. I’m listening to her second album, Party. That’s not left me all year, more so than anything else, music-wise. I listen to lots of drill and grime, I follow [music websites] Trench and GRM Daily, but with this album, I’ve gotten back into singer-songwriter stuff. I saw her at a festival in Tasmania at the start of 2020. She was brilliant: off-the-wall, a bit random but in a good way. It’s folk, a little psychedelic, very minimalist. I know everyone uses it, it’s no shakes, but I spend seven hours a day there. The discourse on it is quite varied and draws me in, whether it’s the current political situation or trying to keep positive through Covid. You can vent your frustrations. You can go there for laughs. I tend to spend most of my time in that space. It’s kind of your only outlet to argue with people you would never be able to approach in real life, like celebrities and politicians. I’m interested in the idea of what hell is. I’m not a religious person, but I am a big believer in hell on Earth. This film tells the story of a van full of coppers driving home one night through the woods. They stumble on a satanic ritual and walk into this brilliant depiction of hell. Absolutely chaotic. People animalised, multiple deaths, you name it. Visually, it’s really unsettling and surreal, but a real comment on human nature.",culture
"Stephen Colbert scrapped a taped monologue and went live at 11.35pm ET on Wednesday night, hours after a mob of armed Trump supporters stormed the Capitol at the president’s behest. “I really want to do the show we’re about to do and I also really don’t want to do the show we’re about to do,” a visibly shaken Colbert said, “because, Lord have mercy, there are some dark subjects that we talk about on the show occasionally, but I’ve rarely been as upset as I am tonight.” The Late Show host then spoke directly to those responsible for inciting the mob, starting with Trump’s allies in Congress who have tolerated or sustained his baseless rejection of Joe Biden’s victory. “Hey, Republicans who supported this president, especially the ones in the joint session of Congress today, have you had enough?” he asked. “After five years of coddling this president’s fascist rhetoric, guess whose followers want to burn down the Reichstag? Because today, the US Capitol was overrun for the first time since 1814, and a woman died. Who could have seen this coming? Everyone? Even dummies like me. This is the most shocking, most tragic, least surprising thing I’ve ever seen. “For years now, people have been telling you cowards that if you let the president lie about our democracy over and over and then join him in that lie and say he’s right when you know for a fact that he is not, there will be a terrible price to pay,” Colbert continued. “But you just never thought you’d have to pay it, too. I really do hope you’re enjoying those tax cuts. And those judges, cause those judges are really going to be working hard. They’re going to be busy throwing these idiots in jail.” Colbert then turned on Fox News: “Do you think maybe years of peddling his conspiracy theories had anything to do with this? ‘Oh, but come on, man, you know we have our opinion side and our news side. And come on, we’re just trying to turn a coin for uncle Rupee, sell a few lubricated catheters.’ Like those lubricated catheters, you know where you can stick your excuses and you can skip the lubrication.” Colbert kept going, pressing Republican senators who until late Wednesday indulged the president’s doubt-mongering over the election: “A little question for the Republican senators who helped foment this insurrection: why’d you run away? I mean, these are your peeps, they love you. Why don’t you hang out with your buddies, Marsha Blackburn, Kelly Loeffler, Ron Johnson, John ‘not that Kennedy’ Kennedy? Because you can run all you want, for the rest of your lives, but you can never escape the responsibility of what you brought upon American democracy today. “This was never some sort of peaceful protest,” he concluded. “This was Charlottesville come home to roost on Capitol Hill.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers issued a sober, measured rebuke of any attempt to minimize what occurred at the Capitol. “I think it’s important, as the first draft of history is being written, and as we’re all processing what we witnessed today, to be as plain-spoken and clear-eyed as possible,” he said. “What we saw today was a violent insurgency, an attempt to overthrow the legitimately elected government of the United States, and it was incited, directed and encouraged by President Donald Trump and more than a few members of the Republican rightwing media.” Trump responded to the mob, which replaced an American flag with a Trump one, brandished Confederate and QAnon paraphernalia, and ransacked congressional offices, with a video of support: “I love you, you’re very special, I know how you feel.” “And he does,” Meyers said. “He knows how they feel, because he spent four years telling them in great and odious detail how they should feel. So we can be shocked, but we can’t be surprised. The president wanted this. He directed it, supported it, he incited it and encouraged it.” Meyers called for Trump’s immediate removal from office and for prosecution – “anything less is tacit permission to continue to use his office and his influence after he leaves office to foment sedition and dismantle democracy” – and redirected attention to the overshadowed runoff races in Georgia, in which the Rev Raphael Warnock became the first black Democrat from any southern state elected to the Senate. “Multiracial, pluralistic democracy is fragile, and precious, and it requires our vigilant stewardship and protection,” Meyers concluded. “And anyone not willing to forward that project with the fullness of their effort must be shamed and disgraced and removed from office.” On the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon struck a much softer if still grave tone. “In times like these I think to myself, ‘How is this happening? How can this be happening?’” he said. “But I’m also thinking, how can I help? And being here tonight, talking to you at home and reassuring you that we’re gonna be OK, and this is not what our country is about, is how I can help. “Today was not patriotism; today was terrorism,” he added, then echoed Biden’s words for Americans to step up. “We’ve seen it over and over again during this pandemic, from the frontline workers to the cashiers at grocery stores to everyone delivering food or raising money for people who need it. We are best when we work together and step up.” He also reiterated the president-elect’s words that “enough is enough is enough”. “I believe that is what a majority of this country has been saying, has been screaming, for a long time now. Enough is enough,” Fallon concluded. “Today was a disgrace. Today was disappointing. But sadly, today was not a surprise. But it’s important to remember that this is not who we are. I assure you that there are more good people then bad. And good will prevail.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the “treason finale of the Donald Trump era” with palpable anger. “The police were very laidback compared to the Black Lives Matter protests,” he said, as some were seen taking selfies with the rioters and opening the gates for them. “It was a terrible day for this country. Our president and the scumbags who have kept this stolen election charade going – that’s you, Josh Hawley, that’s you, Ted Cruz – either intentionally or wildly irresponsibly lit these fires to start a war just to distract us from the fact that Donald Trump lost the election.” Kimmel called Trump, Cruz, Representative Jim Jordan and other Republicans who courted conspiratorial or delusional support based on lies and fear “not Americans”. “There is no ‘we the people’,” in that ideology, he said. “It’s ‘me the people’.”",culture
"In the films of late New Wave director Éric Rohmer, the summer holiday is a site for unmet desires, moral crises and inertia. His young, confused creations live in the languorous space where personal ethics slip and loneliness and listlessness are magnified under the hot sun. With endless leisure time stretching out before them, they stare into the void or entangle themselves in fraught romantic relations – as in the case in his charming yet bittersweet 1983 film Pauline at the Beach (Pauline à la Plage, the third addition to Rohmer’s Comedies and Proverbs sextet), which is currently streaming on Stan. It’s the end of summer and 15-year-old Pauline (Amanda Langlet) has come to a resort town in Normandy to holiday with her older cousin Marion, a fashion designer (Arielle Dombasle, who, with her bulging coral necklace, exuberant hand gestures and fuzzy, blonde blow-out, is almost – but not quite – a caricature of a French fashion person). On the beach, they run into Marion’s old ex, the sharp-jawed, practical Pierre (Pascal Greggory), who in turn bumps into an acquaintance, Henri (Féodor Atkine), a peripatetic (and lecherous) ethnographer. Together they convene at Henri’s house for dinner and discuss love and romance – the kind of earnest conversation that can only arise out of hurried intimacy. Some lines of inquiry: is love all heat and flash, or can it swell slowly? Does love spring from a chance encounter with a total stranger, or only with someone you know? Is blind faith better than pragmatism? Marion, recently separated from her husband, wants to “burn” with love. “I need rapturous delight!” she cries later in the film. Pierre seeks a dependable partner. Henri wants to remain unmoored, led only by his desires. Pauline, a mostly quiet interloper in these disclosures, is looking for romance that extends beyond a glance with a 17-year-old in a restaurant the previous summer. “A wagging tongue bites itself” – a loose translation of a quote by 12th-century poet Chrétien de Troyes – is the proverb that prefaces Pauline at the Beach, where misunderstandings, deceit and self-deception make for lightly farcical ends. Everyone is accused of being in love or infatuated with the wrong person, each slinging choice words about another’s dalliances, which come to involve the town’s ruddy-cheeked sweet-seller and for Pauline, a teenage boy called Sylvain. It’s a cutting yet kind film about how age doesn’t necessitate enlightenment, where the lies of adults collide with the end of childhood innocence. Outside of these amorous antics, Pauline at the Beach hums with the languidness of summer, punctuated by swims, al fresco breakfasts and the infrequent windsurfing lesson. Rohmer, a devout Catholic, saw cinema as a means to faithfully replicate the beauty of God’s creation. In Pauline at the Beach, this creed results in plenty of understated, seasonal splendour: misty ocean vistas, purple hydrangeas in bloom and metallic bathers that stick to bronzed, salt-sprayed limbs. Pauline at the Beach is a good place to start with the work of Rohmer. Like most of his films, talk is eloquent and incessant; the subjects are sex, relationships and fidelity. His characters are tormented by indecision, tempted by their desires (often by a type frequently found in his earlier films: the incorrigible but opaque woman), and even his most despondent individuals still cling to a scrap of hope, and perhaps some magical thinking. Pauline, though, is a rare Rohmer heroine – clear-eyed and unwilling to be sucked into the adults’ charade. “You tell your stories,” Pauline says at the holiday group’s first dinner, as if in premonition of the narratives to be spun. While there might not be much guidance from those “oldies” in her orbit, Pauline does receive a sage lesson about self-delusion. At the trip’s abrupt end, Marion tells Pauline they should convince themselves of contradictory tales about their messy summer romances, in order to assuage their heartbreak. “That way we’ll both be happy,” she asserts, as they drive away.",culture
"Surge by Jay Bernard (2019) Jay Bernard’s powerful and award-winning 2019 poetry collection, Surge,  grapples with the loss of black life. The collection starts by looking over historical scars – “remember we were brought here from the clear waters of our dreams, that we might be named, numbered and forgotten” – but soon the pages are charred and bloody with the presence of new death. The horrors of the night where “flames dem ah fly” are imagined with both tenderness and frankness. These poems often speak in the voice of the New Cross party attendees. Its strong sense of place, its patois, its demand for justice, its curiosity (“Will anybody speak of this?”) are reminders that four decades on, the tragedy remains an open wound. Watch Jay Bernard read from Surge here New Cross Fire Page One by Sir Collins This little-known but significant album was produced and compiled by Sir Collins, who died in 2018, as a tribute to his son, Steve, who, aged 17, lost his life in the fire. Side A features the youthful vocals of his son who sings, chants and toasts on roots and reggae instrumentals recorded as a child and teenager. Steve’s innocent recital of the alphabet is both sweet and sombre on Teach the World ABC while in United We Stand, Sir Collins calls out the names of the New Cross fire victims. Side B covers Bob Marley’s iconic Exodus, a song about freedom, while Peace and Love 1 is a buoyant calypso track that celebrates life with the joyous sound of steel pans. New Craas Massahkah by Linton Kwesi Johnson Celebrated poet Linton Kwesi Johnson’s poem is somewhat of a sibling to his Five Nights of Bleeding, in which he recounts the Brixton riots that occurred in the spring of the same year. Steve McQueen movingly featured the poem in Alex Wheatle in his Small Axe series. The poem illuminates the frustrations felt by black Britain that wanted answers. Beyond its lyrical imagery of melancholy blues and fiery reds, it tells of what followed that fateful night, as Johnson remembers how the event was handled officially. “Plenty papers print pure lie,” he laments, “and the police dem plot and scheme.” In his celebrated dub style, he paints a picture of resistance that sought to remedy the structural biases that exposed the black community to injury and harm. THIRTEEN DEAD 1981 by Keith Piper British artist Keith Piper’s mixed-media artwork features pictures of victims on postcards, each placed on brown and charred patterned wallpaper and skirting board. Hand written in capital letters, next to each image is the nameand the age at which “Babylon snuffed [them] out” and the repeated phrase: “Send this one back to the people and let the people demand an answer.” The artwork was recently exhibited at Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry, together with seminal works from the BLK Art Group, which was founded in 1979 in Wolverhampton to combat racial prejudice in the art world. East of Acre Lane by Alex Wheatle (2001) As historian and writer Paul Gilroy writes in the introduction to Wheatle’s book: “This novel’s historical and geographical setting should be carefully specified. It can be defined by the immediate aftermath of the New Cross Massacre.” The thriller, which culminates in the Brixton riots, begins on 27 January 1981 and follows the life of Biscuit and his sticky relationship to the streets and crime. Wheatle explores the realities of what it meant to be young, poor and black in the 80s, subjected to bad housing, high unemployment and police cruelty. Vron Ware: The Black People’s Day of Action 02.03.1981 Vron Ware captured scenes from the Black People’s Day of Action that followed the fire, when 20,000 people, including Darcus Howe, Alex Pascal and Sybil Phoenix, took to Deptford’s streets, and made their way to Blackfriars Bridge and Fleet Street in order to protest at the failure of the Metropolitan police to properly investigate the tragedy. Captured in vivid detail, Ware’s photographs show the mood of protesters and their powerful signs. The photographs are now part of Autograph ABP’s permanent digital and print archive. Small Axe: Alex Wheatle Steve McQueen’s award-winning film series, Small Axe, is a brilliant depiction of London’s West Indian community between 1969 and 1982. It delves deep into their battles with police, judicial and education systems and also, their moments of euphoria. Alex Wheatle, about the life of the author of East of Acre Lane, follows his journey up to imprisonment for his involvement in the 1981 Brixton riots. The film remembers the New Cross fire with a gripping four-minute montage, featuring Johnson’s New Craas Massahkah and photographs of the aftermath of the fire, the funerals of victims and the Black People’s Day of Action. It’s an unforgettable scene that somehow commands both silence and applause.",culture
"What is going on with Hilaria Baldwin supposedly being fake Spanish? Glad you asked – but there is a lot to cover. Starved of celebrity gossip and, well, all human interest all year, the internet has seized on the suggestion that Alec Baldwin’s wife has – at the very least – habitually over-stated her connection to Spain. I appreciate it doesn’t sound like much but, look, in 2020 we take what we can get.  I understand Hilaria is Alec Baldwin’s wife. But that’s about all I do understand. Where did all this start? A few days before Christmas, Hilaria gave her Instagram followers the gift of a Leibovitz-style photo of her wearing lacy black underwear and holding her bemused-looking baby. The rambling caption suggested that this was in promotion of a lavender ointment cream she claimed at least nominal role in developing. I’m as bemused as the baby. To quote the top-rated comment beneath Hilaria’s post: “What is your point?” We’re getting there. It started to become a saga when the comedian Amy Schumer shared the post on her own Instagram, cracking a joke in the caption that she looked equally glamorous with her own newborn. Schumer later deleted the post after it sparked widespread ribbing and Hilaria took offence. They’ve since made up. That’s a relief. What did Hilaria say? She posted a rambling four-and-a-half minute video in which she suggested that she had been the victim of body-shaming, writing in the caption: “Love a good joke – don’t think this should have been a big deal” – two points which no doubt all of us can get behind.  So far this doesn’t seem to be about, you know, the Spain bit. This is the thing. Bored and observant people on the internet noticed that the Spanish accent with which Hilaria had spoken in the past was mysteriously absent from her verbose video. She has a Spanish accent, because she is Spanish, I assume. Well, until recently, Hilaria’s speakers profile on the CAA website said she was “born in Mallorca, Spain and raised in Boston”. She has said her family lived in Mallorca, and she moved to the US at age 19 to go to university (and so knew “no pop culture”). She also identifies herself in her Instagram bio as “mama to five Baldwinitos” – Leonardo, Carmen Gabriela, Rafael, Romeo Alejandro and Eduardo Pau. But the video resurfaced historic speculation about Hilaria’s Spanish heritage, causing internet detectives to start working overtime – Christmas be damned. Material was unearthed of her American-seeming mother talking about her own childhood in Massachusetts; and the obituary of her paternal grandfather, describing family roots in Vermont that predate the American Revolution. Hilaria was also identified online as a 1992 graduate of the Cambridge School of Weston, suggesting she did not move to the US at 19. There, say people claiming to be her former classmates, she went by Hilary. “You have to admire Hilaria Baldwin’s commitment to her decade-long grift where she impersonates a Spanish person,” tweeted @lenirbriscoe, before sharing clips of Hilaria speaking of married life (“it feels really different”) with a marked Spanish accent and apparently forgetting, on a cooking show, the English word for cucumber. “This woman grew up in Massachusetts,” @lenibriscoe tweeted. Yes, as drama and intrigue go, it is low stakes – but many people seized on it as exactly what they needed at the end of a high-stakes year. So does Hilaria – or Hilary – really have no link to Spain at all? Hilaria’s parents live in Mallorca, and have done since 2011, according to Page Six. According to his online company profile, her father did study Spanish literature and visited the country frequently. Has Hilaria responded?  Oh yes. She addressed the question in another Instagram video – this one is seven-and-a-half minutes long. To summarise, Hilaria says the discrepancies in her biography can be explained by inaccurate reporting, which she has endeavoured to correct; and personal insecurities about her (justifiable) claim to Spain. Hilaria confirms she was born in Boston but as a “different kind of Bostonian”, having spent time in Spain while growing up (those frequent visits!) and speaking both languages. Most of her family lives there now and calls her Hilaria, making it habitual for her – though she will also answer to Hilary. As for her accent, Hilaria denies putting it on: it simply changes, she says, depending on how much Spanish she has been speaking in the recent past. “This is something that I’ve always been a little bit insecure about, but I’ve decided maybe 2021 we will get over that.” We can only hope. And by “definitely addressing it very openly right now”, Hilaria says, she is starting as she means to go on. The speculation troubles her because “my thing is about being authentic — and then if people say I’m not being authentic, it hurts my feelings”. She concludes where we started off: “I don’t really understand why it’s turning into such a big thing.” Shortly afterwards, Hilaria returned to Instagram to dispense further clarification, over six and half more minutes. “I love you,” her husband commented. Is that all Alec has had to say? Oh, no. He has posted his own video, captioned “Consider the source”. It is eight-and-a-half minutes of him railing against media companies, preceded by a frosty festive greeting. Amy Schumer must feel awful about all this. She posted a photo of herself looking wistful in a a large-brimmed sunhat and sunglasses, with the caption: “I get it. I went to Spain a couple times and loved it too.” Schumer concluded with a cucumber emoji – then later deleted the whole thing. ‘Deleted the whole thing’ – now she’s talking my language.",culture
"For someone who professes to be “not a very Christmassy person”, comedian Sara Pascoe managed to enjoy our festive photoshoot. “It was fun,” she insists. “I smashed a bauble and everything.” Why isn’t she very Christmassy? “My parents are atheists and thought it was silly to lie to children, so we never thought Santa was real,” she laughs. “And my dad’s anti-Jesus. We never went for it as a family, so I don’t have that nostalgic relationship with this time of year. But I’m definitely a wintry person. Cold weather, cosy jumpers, walking the dog on a misty morning. And as a vegan, I’m a massive fan of roast potatoes and sprouts. Christmas is worth it just for the sprouts. They’re the main reason it’s not cancelled.” She might have been missing live standup but it’s still been a busy year for the 39-year-old Londoner. Pascoe’s second book, Sex Power Money, came out in paperback. Her sitcom, Out of Her Mind, debuted on BBC Two. Now comes a travel series, The Last Woman on Earth.  As a keen pub quizzer and panel game regular, who better to present our puzzles special and to compose some fiendish questions about the year’s TV for our Quiz Of the Year? Let the games begin. Why do you love a quiz so much?Even if I get all the answers wrong, it’s a fun way of learning. My husband [Australian comedian Steen Raskopoulos, who she married last year] and I went to the local pub and it was hosting an upside-down quiz. If you come second to last, you win all the money. Because we were the only ones there as a pair, we thought we were in with a chance. Then we came absolute last, which was humiliating. The quizmaster felt so sorry for us, he found a book of limericks as a consolation prize. Do you get overcompetitive?I do but it’s enthusiasm for joining in, rather than desperation to be the victor. I did Richard Osman’s House of Games a couple of years ago and was on against Rick Edwards, who’s also very competitive. They repeated that episode recently and I got a message saying: “I got my daughter to watch it because it’s so rare to see such a competitive, bossy woman in the public eye.” [Laughs]. I think it was a compliment. You wrote the foreword for The Feminist Quiz Book…Yes, I did that during lockdown. The book celebrates all these pioneering women forgotten by history. I interviewed Sandi Toksvig at the British Library recently and she’s so passionate about this stuff. Her 2021 Almanac is full of these incredible stories. She was telling me about Kathrine Switzer, the first woman to run the Boston Marathon, illegally, in the 60s. She registered under a gender-neutral name, wore a baggy tracksuit so everyone assumed she was a man and ran it. An official realised two miles into the race and tried to grab her but she finished. Five years later, they finally opened it to women. Do feminism and quizzes go together?Very much. Quizzes are best when you assume you know the answer but you’re wrong. Like on QI, when the buzzer goes off. That’s why podcasts No Such Thing As a Fish and You’re Wrong About are so great. Feminism and quizzes are a nice fit because sometimes we’ve learned stories the wrong way or overlooked a woman’s work. For example, Francis Crick and two male colleagues were awarded the Nobel prize for discovering DNA but Rosalind Franklin wasn’t. It’s important for these women to be recognised. How about board games?Trivial Pursuit is my absolute favourite. Word games, too: Scrabble, Boggle, Bananagrams. I love Settlers of Catan if you’ve got enough people. When I was a child, my sister Christina was in hospital a lot, so we’d play Guess Who? on her bed because it had the least amount of components to fly around and get lost. You can’t play Hungry Hungry Hippos in a hospital ward. Loads of Connect Four, too. Christina’s still unbeatable at it. She’s now a mum of two in her 30s but she can hustle you. It doesn’t matter who starts first, she’ll win. Have you watched The Queen’s Gambit and been inspired to play chess?Yep, within about 10 minutes of the first episode, I was like: “Right, I’m going to get really good at chess.” So many people are going to get chess sets for Christmas. What’s the premise of your new BBC travel series, The Last Woman on Earth?It’s me learning how to do the world’s most endangered jobs. Some professions are going to stop existing soon – whether it’s down to technology, climate change or other factors. I go to Cuba, which is opening up to the global market; Georgia, where traditions are being lost due to modernisation; and Finland, where so many industries are dependent on ice and snow. Are you a fan of celebrity travelogues?I like Anthony Bourdain’s because he’s so passionate about food. I don’t tend to watch other comedians’ ones. One of our directors had worked with Romesh Ranganathan and there was one time in Georgia when I didn’t want to do this traditional dance because it would be disrespectful. He said: “Romesh had to clean a horse’s penis, surely you can do one little dance?” I was like: “OK, I’ll do the little dance.” God bless Romesh for doing whatever he gets told but he’s set a dangerous precedent for the rest of us. “Look, Romesh won a Bafta, so just do it, OK?” Some of the jobs you try are quite dangerous. What was the most hair-raising experience?So many things sound fun during a production meeting in London but turn out to be horrific. I had to climb a giant tree in Cuba to collect coconuts. They told me it was all about core strength and I was like: “Cool, I do yoga, I can plank for 46 seconds, I’ll be straight up that tree.” But I couldn’t believe how hard it was. Meanwhile, this little old man who’d had two brandies with his lunch was whizzing up. It was scary in Georgia when there were armed Russian soldiers around. But the only time I feared I might die was when I fell off a horse and thought it might trample me. It didn’t. I was just covered in mud and a bit embarrassed for the rest of the day. Your sitcom Out of Her Mind aired in October. How do you feel it went down?Because it’s a bit boundary-pushing and non-traditional, we knew it might be divisive but I’ve had lovely responses. What was it like having Juliet Stevenson and Ade Edmondson play your parents?I always had Juliet in mind but people kept telling me I wouldn’t get her. It’s fine to have her on your moodboard but don’t be disappointed. But I hand-wrote her a letter saying “Will you be my mummy?” and she said yes! I met Adrian on [BBC show] I’ll Get This. We played this game where we had five clear shots in front of us. You had to down them, then your opponent guessed if it was vodka or water from your facial expressions. He drank all five like water and beat me, then he admitted he’d been filming War & Peace and had got really good at downing vodka. Anyway, I ended up adapting the father character for him and luckily he said yes as well. They were both brilliant. Amazing at their jobs but great fun to be around too. Jack Gleeson (AKA Joffrey from Game Of Thrones) appears as the ghost of your abortion. How did that come about?He’s friends with my husband from the comedy scene. We begged him and he did it as a favour. He was so perfect. His babyface was heartbreaking. I’ve never seen Game of Thrones but I hear he’s a villain, which I can’t imagine. I don’t see him that way at all. Is it annoying that female-led sitcoms tend to get seen as autobiographical?I understand why. We want to know if we’re being lied to. It happens to me with standup too – people really want to know which bits are true and which are fictional. But it’s not just women who get asked. Male novelists get it when it seems like they’re drawing from their own experience. Dolly Alderton sent me this quote the other day: “All of it’s true, none of it happened”, which sums it up perfectly. I was trying to deal with true emotional responses while not being entirely autobiographical. Do you ever get in trouble with friends, family or exes for telling their stories?I always check first. Because I’m a confessional comic, I’ve learned the hard way from upsetting people in the past. Nowadays there’s a lot of: “Hey, you haven’t heard from me in five years but I’ve got a book deal and…” How has your lockdown been?We got Covid in March, so we got it out of the way early. Since then we’ve been pretty much housebound, just pottering around. We’ve been growing herbs and cooking more meals. I’ve read piles of books and been learning to knit. The poor dog has never been so walked. I get his lead and he looks at me like: “Please, I’m tired, Let me sleep.” It’s what I imagine retirement feels like, apart from the queueing outside Sainsbury’s. My friend was telling me yesterday that everyone’s menstrual cycles have gone crazy. Apparently we’ve all got pandemic womb on top of everything else. Great! You turn 40 next May. Will you throw a party?I’m not really a party person but I’m looking forward to doing live standup again. That’s my proper job, my happy place and a gig will be my party. When we can all be in a room together again, that will be the sign that everyone’s OK and everything’s back to normal. The Last Woman on Earth With Sara Pascoe airs on BBC Two, Sunday 27 December at 9pm. All episodes of Out of Her Mind are on BBC iPlayer",culture
"The future of a museum that tells the astonishing story of the British “father of immunology” is hanging in the balance because it has been forced to close throughout the Covid crisis and faces uncertainty over how it will operate in the post-pandemic world. Edward Jenner’s former family home in Gloucestershire has been shut since February, and the decision has been taken to keep it closed until spring, meaning it will lose more than a year’s vital admission fees. Supporters of Dr Jenner’s House, which bills itself as the birthplace of vaccination, have pointed out the irony of it facing financial crisis in the year when its subject matter is so pertinent. Owen Gower, the museum’s manager, said Jenner’s work had taken on a new relevance in 2020. “But unfortunately we’ve had to close our doors for it,” he said. Born in 1749, Jenner spent much of his childhood exploring the countryside around his home. He was a polymath who studied medicine, horticulture and the natural world, achieving his fellowship of the Royal Society for a paper on the nesting habits of cuckoos. In 1796, he carried out the world’s first controlled vaccination against smallpox and established a free vaccination clinic in the Temple of Vaccinia, a summerhouse in the garden of Chantry House. The museum in the village of Berkeley tells the story of Jenner and the wider history of vaccination. Visitors are invited to view his study, the gardens and summerhouse and study the wider history of vaccination. Boris Johnson name-checked Jenner this week at his press conference on the day the first Covid vaccine was given approval for use in the UK, saying the techniques used by today’s scientists were “pioneered in this country by Edward Jenner”. But despite Jenner’s place in history, his former home – which opened as a museum 35 years ago – is not particularly well known. Only about 7,000 people a year visit, with most tourists to the region heading to the Cotswolds or the cities of Bath and Bristol rather than Berkeley. Until 2020, it had just about scraped through but faced a crisis when Covid meant it had to close completely to visitors. Gower said: “Seventy per cent of our income is visitor admissions. That disappeared overnight. That’s the core funding. We don’t have any regular government grants.” Reopening is proving difficult because its modest size makes social distancing difficult. Gower said: “It’s a small family home, that’s the charm of it, but it’s also the challenge of operating safely and sustainably in the age of Covid-19.” A crowd-funding effort was launched and helped raise enough money to secure the museum’s future until the spring, but the museum warns that it has not been saved from permanent closure. The Jenner Trust, the charity that runs the museum, has ambitious plans to reshape what it does, expanding its remit to inspire not only those who visit in person but reach out to people around the world through online events and conferences. It is seeking funding for this concept and also wants to build an endowment to allow the building to be looked after in perpetuity. Gower said: “We are trying to look to the future. We want what we have here to be accessible to the whole world, not just to people who come to Berkeley.”",culture
"It began with a fabulous 19th-century dress and a box of jumbled photographs cleared out of a Guildford attic before a move to the country. It has resulted in being able to tell the true, poignant story of Ranavalona III, the last queen of Madagascar. Ranavalona’s remarkable life of can be revealed thanks to the auction this week of personal effects unearthed by a descendent of Clara Herbert, who worked for the Madagascan royal family from the 1890s to the 1920s. Herbert was the paid companion to a queen whose adventures were the stuff of fiction. Widowed at 22, she was made to marry an elderly prime minister, dethroned after a French invasion and exiled to Algiers, never to return. The auctioneer Kerry Taylor has pieced together Ranavalona’s story from the box of photographs, postcards, souvenirs, receipts and diaries that she is selling on Tuesday. “It has been the most fascinating detective work,” she said. “The queen I think was a very brave woman. She was very strong in adversity … she had to make the best of what life dealt her.” Ranavalona’s husband was poisoned when she was about to accede to the throne. The finger has been pointed at the prime minister, a much older man who had been married to two previous queens and wanted Ranavalona as his bride. “This poor girl had to marry this horrible old man,” said Taylor. “She was told she just needed to do needlework and look nice.” Bigger trouble was on the horizon. Soon into her reign, in 1895, France invaded and annexed the island. Ranavalona was initially allowed to stay as a puppet queen, but the French authorities accused her influential aunt Ramisindrazana of inciting Malagasy rebels. Ranavalona, her aunt and other members of the royal family were packed off to the island of Réunion, where photographs in the archive show how miserable they were. “They all look so upset, thin and drawn,” said Taylor. “You have Ranavalona and her aunt and her nephew in a bowler hat outside this weird-looking palace that they had built for them, it is like a villa in wood.” The cast of characters in the photographs includes the 14-year-old princess Razafinandriamanitra, heavily pregnant with the child of a French soldier. Soon the royal family was put onboard a boat for France. They dreamed of Paris, but when they docked in Marseille it became clear that was not the plan. On being told they were going to Algiers, Ranavalona burst into tears and declared: “Who is certain of tomorrow? Only yesterday I was a queen. Today I am simply an unhappy, broken-hearted woman.” Algiers turned out not to be so bad. It had a lively social scene and the queen became something of a local celebrity. The archive includes musical programmes dedicated to her and a biscuit wrapper with her portrait. There are photographs showing how happy she looks. The contrast from earlier images is remarkable, said Taylor. “You have to pinch yourself, you say that can’t be her, it looks like a different person. She has put on weight, she looks healthy and beautiful … She seriously looks a different woman altogether.” In 1901, she finally got to go to France, where she spent a fortune on dresses and was followed everywhere she went, said Taylor. “People are fascinated … She’s beautiful, she’s dressed in the best French fashions and she’s a queen. What’s not to like?” After Ranavalona’s death in 1917, her aunt was given permission to move to the south of France, accompanied by the ever-loyal Herbert. Ramisindrazana died in about 1923 and it is her elaborate dark purple velvet and cyclamen pink satin court dress, probably made in Madagascar, which ended up in the Guildford attic, along with the box of mementos. Herbert briefly sought work in Nice before returning to the UK, where she lived in Reading. Her thirst for travel soon returned and she went to China as a Methodist missionary. Taylor said it was incredibly rare to find high fashion from the 19th century worn by black women, “and even more rare to find such a wealth of documents, photographs and ephemera to augment our understanding of them”. Taylor has an estimate of £1,000-1,500 on the archive, but she admits the figure is a stab in the dark. “How do you value it? Where do you start?” she said.",culture
"Cate Blanchett-led refugee drama Stateless and Shannon Murphy’s coming-of-age film Babyteeth have blitzed the 2020 Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (Aacta) awards, sharing 22 wins between them at an unusual ceremony capping off an unusual year. A seemingly smaller than usual selection of films and TV shows graced the nomination lists this year, with the industry mainly celebrating productions that were completed before Covid-19 restrictions hit. Russell Crowe, newly inaugurated president of the academy, addressed the socially distanced ceremony at The Star casino in Sydney on Monday afternoon remotely – from a locale he referred to only as “the bush” – saying he hoped to see more federal support for film and television in post-Covid Australia. “Twelve months ago this area around here was scorched and burnt,” he said. “I imagine there’s a lot of you feeling the same way for what has been a very challenging year for the arts. Just as these paddocks and trees have new growth, the same thing will happen with our screen industry.” He noted the Australian government’s handling of the pandemic and the fact that low case numbers meant screen production had restarted here. “I want to encourage the federal government to use this time to set a platform so this rise in production can be facilitated to continue,” Crowe said. “Given the right support, the screen industry can be used as a powerful driver for economic recovery.” This year, the main ceremony was split into two events: film, followed by TV. The TV categories were dominated by the ABC drama Stateless, which Blanchett co-created, co-executive produced and co-starred in. The series, directed by Emma Freeman and Jocelyn Moorhouse, follows four people as they interact with Australia’s notoriously harsh immigration detention system, and is reportedly based on true stories. Guardian reviewer Luke Buckmaster called it a “gripping” drama with a “curious mixture of nail-biting verisimilitude and psychologically charged aesthetic”. The cast of Stateless, including Fayssal Bazzi, Yvonne Strahovski, Darren Gilshenan, and Blanchett won all of the acting awards for TV drama. The show was announced best telefeature or miniseries, and also swept up statuettes for best screenplay (Elise McCredie) and best direction. It bested other multiple nominees Bloom and Mystery Road; the latter of which, however, did win best drama series. Meanwhile, the film categories were dominated by Babyteeth, which Observer reviewer Wendy Ide called “possibly the most joyous, life-affirming film ever to be made about terminal disease.” Babyteeth – Shannon Murphy’s directorial debut – won for best film, best screenplay (Rita Kalnejais) and best direction, and also cleaned up in the acting categories, with Eliza Scanlen winning best lead actress for her turn as cancer-diagnosed teen Milla, Toby Wallace best lead actor, Ben Mendelsohn best supporting actor and Essie Davis taking home best supporting actress in a film. Mendelsohn accepted his award from Sicily, appearing in a prerecorded video in a bathrobe at 4am after a late night shoot. “I love Babyteeth,” he said. “Of the films of mine that I’ve seen, it’s my favourite.” Babyteeth also received awards for best casting and best original score, bringing its total awards to nine, from 12 nominations. In slightly lighter fare, Tim Minchin’s comedy TV series Upright won best in that category, while Minchin himself won best comedy performer. Shaun Micallef’s Mad As Hell won in the marginally different category of best comedy entertainment program. The wildly popular Emmy-award-winning cartoon Bluey was awarded best children’s program. The Aactas are traditionally presented across two dates, the first being the industry luncheon – this year replaced by an online event last week – which honour the less high profile craft practitioners, such as those in cinematography, costume and make-up, editing, score and sound. Stateless also dominated the craft awards, with its first episode, The Circumstances in Which They Come, yielding five of the six awards the show picked up last week. The others were for best cinematography, costume design, editing, production design, and sound in the television categories. Episode six of the series also won the award for best original score. The True History of the Kelly Gang, which had seemed a strong contender in the film categories and was nominated for 10 awards, picked up three in craft: best costume design, hair and make-up, and production design. The Invisible Man, starring US actor Elisabeth Moss, also picked up three craft awards, for cinematography, editing and sound. Indigenous legal academic, writer and filmmaker Larissa Behrendt won the award for best direction in nonfiction television for her work on Maralinga Tjarutja, a documentary about the nuclear testing on Indigenous country in the 1950s and 60s and the consequences for the local people. Also honoured was Jennifer Kent, who was announced as the recipient of the Byron Kennedy award for low-budget genre filmmaking and creative resilience over the past decade for her international success with the 2014 film, The Babadook. See the Aactas website for a full list of winners and nominees. Highlights from Monday’s ceremony will be broadcast on Channel Seven on Wednesday at 8.30pm.",culture
"After months of confinement and inactivity, you might think you know the sound of absolutely nothing happening. But Radio Lento is determined to prove you wrong. The weekly podcast, which is becoming something of a lockdown hit, plays unedited recordings of rural environments across the UK – with no talking, no music and no other enhancements. It’s just the wind, the water and the cries of animals. Tides turn, owls call softly and the sound of far-off church bells carries over the fields. “It’s for people who want to put the outside on their ears,” says co-founder Hugh Huddy. “It’s like photographs – but sound photographs.” Listening to such rich soundscapes instils a sense of peace, says Huddy, who calls the result “visceral relaxation – your body letting go but your brain switching on”. Lento has now clocked up more than 14,000 downloads since it launched in March, an astonishing result for a kitchen-table podcast created by first-timers. Artists have been recording nature for decades. Whalesong was huge in the 1970s. More recently, Jana Winderen and Chris Watson have used field recordings in their compositions, to haunting effect. But these sound artists tend to treat the audio as material for highly crafted creations. Radio Lento takes a different path, giving us the raw sound as a way to express the spirit of a place. “What we’re trying to do,” says Huddy, “is find places that have a beauty about them, that are empty of people – and capture their essence.” Huddy has been capturing nature since 2004, initially making short field recordings, then experimenting with hiding microphones in trees. Along with his partner, Madeleine Sugden, they honed their technique on epic family walks. As the spring lockdown began to bite, they listened back through their archive recordings and found them unexpectedly fulfilling, which gave them the idea for Radio Lento. “We were struck with cabin fever,” says Huddy. “Listening to the recordings blocked out distracting noise – loud music, the neighbour’s angle grinder. The soundscapes suddenly had a value they hadn’t had before. It’s slow radio, but not like the BBC’s slow radio, where they cherrypick moments when something happens. That’s guided listening. We make ourselves transparent.” Lento’s artistry lies in selecting the right section from hours of recording, not just the highlights. One 40-minute episode is called Tawny Echoes in the Cathedral of Trees, while Night Beside a Stream in Wales lasts a full hour. “We’re not interested in getting ‘the perfect owl’,” says Sugden. “To really appreciate an owl, or a stream, you need time, within the context of everything else that’s going on. The concept of time is what we want to preserve.” Before long, Huddy and Sugden were leaving microphones out overnight to capture the most peaceful hours, staying in a youth hostel nearby with the kids. Unlike the cutting-edge recordings made by professionals such as Watson, Radio Lento is a family affair. With two lively – “very lively” – children and no car, the family must travel by train from London to find their quiet places, lugging a flask of tea, copious biscuits and warm clothes, as well as the audio kit. Sugden and Huddy reckon they’ve walked more than 150 miles since the podcast began. To camouflage the microphones and protect them from the elements, they designed their own rig and built it on their kitchen table. “That’s taken a lot of trial and error.” And to work out where to site the mics, they simply stand in a promising spot and rotate their heads like a radar antenna. It’s surprisingly successful. That said, there have been some disasters. Nature itself doesn’t always cooperate. “Once, some wasps found the rig,” says Huddy. “They were chewing on the wood to get it for their nests. You would never normally hear that sound – it’s so subtle. They did it for two hours. Their little jaws scratching, scratching. It makes your skin crawl.” The recording had to be ditched. On one beach recording in Essex, an audibly strong gust of wind is followed by the metallic thunk of the mic toppling over on the shingle. Running footsteps are heard and then there’s a scraping noise as the rig is righted. You can almost hear a sigh of relief. “If the tide had been two inches further in,” says Huddy, “we’d have lost the whole lot.” Moments like this remind listeners that people are a part of the landscape, too. Radio Lento doesn’t attempt to capture “pure nature”, unspoiled by human contact, if there’s any such thing. It is not unknown for a distant jet to make a faint appearance, or for far-off road noise to be heard as a hedgehog snuffles through the undergrowth. In future, Sugden and Huddy hope to expand the therapeutic uses for Radio Lento. “There was a geography teacher who was playing it to her classes,” says Sugden. “She said they had the calmest lesson they’d had for ages.” People with tinnitus and insomnia also sing its praises. Even pets are fans: one listener’s dog took refuge from fireworks in a Lento podcast, while another’s cat appreciated the birdsong. Best of all, subscribers are starting to send in their own field recordings. “We’re getting people to listen, to sit and take stock, and think, ‘That sounds nice’,” Sugden says. In a world of angle grinders and next door’s techno, listening to wind rustling in the trees for a few hours may be exactly what we need.",culture
"I know it is tedious to look back on 2020 and force everything through the prism of coronavirus – “Hey, remember that absolute horrorshow of a year we all just-about lived through? Well, let’s look back on the horror again, shall we?” – but it is slightly unavoidable when recapping what is arguably the weirdest year in television since the format was invented. We have, each of us, watched more TV in the last nine months than at any other time in our lives. And yet, with so little of it being newly produced, there has been an odd staleness to our viewing habits. I’m bored of live TV and I’m bored of box sets, so what else is there to do? Read a book? Behave. The first thing we need to confront is the short-lived Zoom era of Lockdown 1.0, which wasn’t very good. It’s harsh of me to single people out, but The Steph Show on Channel 4 was an early example of form clattering up against need, as a cheery Steph McGovern tried to hold together a light magazine show from the comfort of her own home. Yes, it was rubbish (and the less-constrained Steph’s Packed Lunch studio variation shows that the desperately-broadcasting-from-a-house was the faulty part, not the rest of the show’s format), but crucially it started airing on 30 March – the date we still thought we’d all be back at work within a couple of weeks – and the sheer fact that someone tried to launch a magazine show to keep us all entertained in the middle of a history-shaping global emergency is something to be commended. Then we started to cope. This was officially The Year TV Presenters Started Standing Really Far Apart, and that will probably continue deep into 2021. Some formats have coped pretty well with social distancing, because they were basically socially distanced anyway – Sunday Brunch has done just fine, proving Tim Lovejoy is a sort of TV cockroach that even nukes cannot finish off – and, once it restarted, Sky’s bombastic blokes-shouting-opinions-at-each-other-while-absolutely-not-touching-at-all football coverage remained largely the same. It is possible our standards dropped a little – The Queen’s Gambit and The Undoing were both feted simply because they were new TV, rather than good TV – but then I suppose one of the major symptoms of coronavirus is a loss of taste. It should be said, though, that I May Destroy You, Normal People and Industry more than made up for, say, Netflix’s The Stranger. Part of me is hopeful for the next couple of years of TV – if nothing else, writers have had nine months to develop stellar ideas, and those scripts that didn’t go into production before the pandemic have had almost a full year of polish – but I don’t want to diminish the here and now. TV has been there for us, and for that reason, one of my shows of the year was The Great British Bake Off – normally something I dismiss as twee nonsense for people who only go to Glastonbury to drink gin – but this year elevated to essentially a public health service, with cast and crew bubbling together to make a cosy competition show that felt like a tranquil island of normality. So that’s 2020, then: not the best year for innovation, nor for the premium quality drama we’ve grown accustomed to in the golden age of TV, but it’s kept going, and that’s something to be thankful for, at least.",culture
"As president of the United States – at least, for 49 more days – Donald Trump retains the power to pardon anyone of a federal crime in “one of the weirdest quirks of being an American president”, said Trevor Noah, “sort of like a cheat code for America’s criminal justice system. “And it looks like President Trump is going to spend the next two months mashing those buttons,” the Daily Show host continued, as Trump has reportedly considered issuing pre-emptive pardons for his three eldest children, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, none of whom have been charged with a crime. “Aw, guys, that is adorable. Trump is pardoning his kids and his house pets,” Noah joked, referring to Giuliani. “And he’s not even pardoning them for anything specific. Trump is just handing out pardons like they’re gift cards.” In another layer to a scandal sandwich, the Department of Justice revealed an investigation into a bribery scheme for presidential pardons. Basically, Noah explained, “Trump managed to shove one of his scandals in the middle of another scandal. So impressive.” Unsealed documents from the investigation reveal someone, name redacted, contributed a large sum of money to the Trump campaign in exchange for a presidential pardon; it is not clear if Trump pardoned the person in question, considered a pardon, or even if he knew about the contribution. “We don’t know what Trump did,” said Noah, but “after knowing Trump for this long, I think we can assume that my man is not gonna turn down some pardon cash. If anything, I think we should be impressed that he hasn’t started targeting Instagram ads to former felons.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert replayed an emotional, bracing speech from Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who oversaw the implementation of a new voting system in Georgia, in which he decried the president’s refusal to rein in his supporters and pleaded with Trump to “stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence”. The speech went viral, and Sterling “was praised for his courage, his clarity and his call to civility”, said Colbert. “The president heard that … and popped open a can of ‘suck it’.” On Wednesday afternoon, Trump posted a conspiracy theory-filled rant on Facebook – “no press, no questions, not even the mediating lower third graphics of cable news”, Colbert explained. “Just uncut blue-flake crazy packed into a straw and blown right into the brain stem of the kamikaze Maga dead-enders.” Colbert described the video as “just another rambling mass of lies that lasted a full 46 minutes” that should’ve been released on Thanksgiving, “not because he said anything worth hearing, but at least the people who canceled a big family Thanksgiving could’ve pretended they were still eating with their racist uncle.” At one point in his rant, Trump demonstrated a “surprising amount of self-awareness”, in revealing “even knew how poorly his stupidity would be received” – “Even what I’m saying now will be demeaned and disparaged, but that’s OK,” said the president. “Well, as long as it’s OK, you’re a petty, angry man desperate for validation you will never receive and have never deserved,” Colbert snapped. “And in 50 days, you’ll be out of the White House without the protections of executive power, and no court is going to uphold you pardoning yourself.” As of Tuesday, all contested states had certified their election results, cementing Biden’s victory. “And yet, still, still Republicans are terrified to speak that basic truth,” Colbert said, pointing to Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson, who admitted in a phone call with a reporter that he knew Biden had won but saying so publicly would be “political suicide”. “Really? I would say the real political suicide is refusing to distance yourself from a president who has lost and is willing to destroy democracy and your party out of spite,” Colbert responded. “It’s like the GOP is saying, ‘hey, let’s play hands on a hard body on this running pickup inside this closed garage – do not open the door to let oxygen in. That would be political suicide and it would hurt the truck’s feelings.’” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped a less-than-safe Christmas gathering at the White House, where numerous guests attended the indoor event without masks. Trump “told revelers it’s been an amazing four years”, Kimmel reported, “which is a sentiment shared only by white supremacists and the guys who make money impersonating him on Cameo”. “All anyone at the White House wants for Christmas this year is a pardon,” Kimmel added, gesturing to reports that the president was considering pre-emptive pardons for his children “for whatever crimes they may or may not have committed”. “Usually, presidents grant pardons after they’ve been vetted very carefully by the justice department,” Kimmel explained. “Trump is shooting them out of a T-shirt cannon right now.”",culture
"Another post-election day, another round of Donald Trump’s “bar fight with reality”, according to Trevor Noah, although that may be coming to an end with a death knell dismissal from the supreme court of a Republican-backed lawsuit to overturn the election in Pennsylvania. It took just 34 minutes from the brief’s filing for the court to issue a one-sentence rebuke: “the application for injunctive relief presented to justice Alito and by him referred to the court is denied”. There was no recorded dissent from any of the nine justices, including Trump’s three appointees. In other words, “Trump is taking L’s, people,” said the Daily Show host. “Not only did they shut this case down, but they shut it down in just 34 minutes. They didn’t even pretend that they were going to consider it! This is like asking somebody out and they just shut you down immediately. “You can’t blame the supreme court for not wanting to get involved in Trump’s case,” Noah added, “because we all have that one friend that when you see them crying, you think, ‘You know, I’m just gonna keep walking. Because if I try to help, it’s gonna become a whole thing …’” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee celebrated Trump’s final days in office, although “unfortunately, along with stealing all the copper wiring in the White House, Trump may spend his last days doing what he does best: making sure nobody in his life ever faces consequences”. The president has reportedly discussed pre-emptive pardons for some of his closest allies, including his three oldest children and son-in-law Jared Kushner, or perhaps even himself. “Presidential clemency is supposed to correct injustice,” Bee explained, “which, to be fair, some presidents have actually done.” Barack Obama commuted the sentences of hundreds of non-violent drug offenders, Jimmy Carter pre-emptively pardoned Vietnam draft dodgers, and George HW Bush “pre-emptively pardoned his digestive system before vomiting all over the Japanese prime minister.” “Presidents can use pardons for good, but abusing them doesn’t just protect bad people now, it also influences bad people later,” she added. Ford’s pardon of Nixon, for example, was ostensibly to heal the nation after the bruising Watergate scandal, “but if Nixon had faced real consequences, it could’ve made subsequent administrations think twice before abusing their power. That’s why whether or not Trump pardons himself, states still need to investigate him and his allies. “It’s not about vengeance, it’s about restoring our faith in institutions and strengthening the guardrails that have barely held over the last four years,” Bee concluded. “Because if we fail to learn from Trump’s attempts to defeat democracy, we’ll have no one but ourselves to blame when the next Republican administration comes along to finish the job he started.” “January 20 cannot come fast enough,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show, as he looked forward to the date when “America will usher in a glorious new era of basic competence” with newly announced, experience-based cabinet appointments. Biden announced this week that Dr Vivek Murthy will serve as his surgeon general and replace “the old surgeon general, a tongue depressor with googly eyes,” Colbert joked. Meanwhile, “despite Biden’s appointments, our current president continues to deny reality”, Colbert continued, as he reportedly considers mass pardons for staff, even those not accused of any crime. It’s “not really the behavior you expect to see from someone who’s going to be around for another four years”, Colbert explained. “If your 90-year-old grandpa starts taking a trip to Italy, skydives and has a threesome, he’s not crossing items off his ‘live forever’ list.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers blasted the president’s bungling of a deal with Pfizer for additional coronavirus vaccines. Because Trump passed on the deal months ago, Pfizer might not have more doses for the US until next June, while America faces potential vaccine shortages amid global competition. “I knew Trump was a shit businessman, but I didn’t realize he was this bad,” Meyers said. “I’m starting to think if you gave him a time machine, he’d go back to the year 2000 and buy stock in apples and Enron. “Trump championed the vaccine as the one thing he was doing to combat the virus,” Meyers added, “and even that he fucked up. It’s like if the Flash showed up to the Justice League with a pulled hamstring.” Meyers also recapped a peak Trump-era moment in which Fox News interrupted his campaign-style event for Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s vaccine initiative, to inform viewers of the supreme court’s dismissal of the Trump campaign’s Hail Mary lawsuit to overturn the election in Pennsylvania. “I’m not sure there’s a single moment that captures this farce better,” said Meyers. “It’s like if halfway through Sesame Street, Big Bird interrupted a song about the alphabet, looked straight into the camera and said: ‘Breaking news, kid. No one likes you, and you’re never going to learn how to spell.”",culture
"Survivors, families of victims and the local mayor have expressed deep misgivings about the production of a new film that will depict the days leading up to the Port Arthur massacre, which claimed 35 lives in 1996.  On Monday, streaming service Stan announced the film NITRAM, which has already commenced production in Geelong, Victoria. It is being helmed by Snowtown director Justin Kurzel, and stars Judy Davis, Anthony LaPaglia, Essie Davis and American actor Caleb Landry Jones as the gunman, whose first name is spelled backwards in the title. But while little is known about the film at this stage, many have expressed their dismay at its potential to glamorise the killer, reignite conspiracy theories and retraumatise survivors of what, at the time, was the largest single shooter killing ever. Hobart writer Justin Woolley was 12 years old when he witnessed the shootings from 100 metres away. On Twitter on Tuesday he said “the largest peace-time massacre by a single shooter in history” needed to be remembered and commemorated. “But turning it into a piece of money-making entertainment? You’ll have to excuse me, and I would have though any right-minded person, for believing that is tasteless.” Woolley said he wasn’t calling for the film to be censored. “I will be steering clear of it for obvious reasons, but I’m not advocating it be stopped,” he wrote. “They are free to make this movie, sure, but that also means I’m allowed to say I think it’s a horrible idea.” Stan has undertaken to respond to the Guardian’s questions about whether any affected parties were consulted prior to the film going into production, and to concerns voiced by survivors and people in the Port Arthur community. Stan was unable to respond before publication of this story. The film is being shot in regional Victoria instead of Tasmania, a decision that the Guardian understands was made out of respect for the residents in and near Port Arthur. The producers have also made it clear the film will not portray the actual massacre; only the events leading up to it and what may have been going on inside the head of the gunman. But for Woolley this does not pass muster. “As an author I know well that in order to create a story about this individual it is necessary to generate sympathy in the audience, at least have them relate to the subject. It is this, in a film portraying the life of Martin Bryant, that I strongly object to,” he wrote on Twitter. “We do not need a study of the motivations of the perpetrator of this crime. We know them already.” While little is known about the film at this stage, a spokesperson for the Alannah and Madeline Foundation, a children’s charity established by Walter Mikac after he lost his two young daughters and wife in the shooting, said the foundation was firmly against any film that could cause distress to those affected. “The foundation is consistent in its views that out of respect for the survivors, it is not appropriate to give any platform to the perpetrator,” the spokesperson said, telling Guardian Australia that Mikac did not wish to discuss the project personally. “Films like this do nothing to help the understanding of such grotesque, violent and inhumane acts,” she said. “We don’t want to suppress creativity and art … we understand it’s a really difficult balancing act. But we’re not interested in giving the perpetrator a moment in the sun.” The film was commissioned by the Melbourne international film festival, where it will premiere in 2021. On Tuesday, Screen Australia posted a tweet saying it had not funded NITRAM. The Police Association of Tasmania, whose members were among the first on the scene of the 28 April 1996 shootings, also indicated their wariness over the potential impact of the film. “A commercial movie about the Port Arthur mass murderer has the potential to severely affect the mental health of many, many Tasmanians, including current and past members of the Police Association of Tasmania,” the association’s president, Colin Riley, told the Guardian in a statement. Kelly Spaulding, the mayor of Port Arthur municipality Tasman Council, said news of the film going into production could have already retraumatised some of those close to the tragedy. “The community is pretty upset down here,” he said. “Every time the media brings this up it brings back a lot of feelings which are obviously still quite raw, and it affects families not just down here but those living across Australia and overseas as well.” Spaulding said Monday’s announcement “came like a bolt out of the blue”. “It’s a bit disappointing nobody [the producers] thought to give us a heads up,” he said. “Obviously there’s nothing we can do to stop them ... I just hope people don’t mention [the gunman’s] name.” The Alannah and Madeline Foundation said the producers had contacted them early on, but prior to Monday’s announcement they “weren’t aware of any logistical details or project development”. The foundation is regularly contacted by researchers and creatives seeking to retell the story, they said, but “we politely decline as our focus is on the prevention of violence to children … we do not seek to glorify or publicise this crime”. Apart from retraumatising survivors, the foundation’s main concern was the influence it might have on other deeply disturbed individuals. “What we have seen in the past is that every time we put a spotlight on someone who has [committed a violent crime], the idea of instant celebrity attracts others,” the spokesperson said. The film has divided people on Twitter: while many have rejected its premise, others have highlighted how little we know about it. “The discourse already is so perplexing,” tweeted film critic Glenn Dunks. “While I understand the desire to not put victims through the trauma of a reenactment film (is that what it will be? we don’t quite know), we have likely all watched stuff on 9/11 or Columbine. What makes Australian crime so off limits to artists?” Composer John Haddock was among a group of six Opera Australia artists who sat next to the gunman at the Broad Arrow cafe that day. He later hid with many others in a stable at the far end of the complex, as the shots repeatedly rang out across the eerie landscape. “My first reaction [to the film] was ‘this a tricky one’,” Haddock told the Guardian. “Is this appropriate? It brings back terrible memories, even now as I talk about it. But this is fine with me because I read that the film won’t be reliving the massacre. If that was the case I could not bear it.” Haddock said the trauma had lessened over the years, to the point that the events of that Sunday afternoon are now just a bad memory. But he is concerned that fresh attention will stir up the conspiracy theorists and people like Pauline Hanson, who in March last year implied in comments recorded secretly by al-Jazeera that the 1996 massacre was a government conspiracy. “It makes me angry, having lived through it,” he said.",culture
"The Adelaide festival has launched its 2021 program after a nightmare year that has seen more than 200 international artists scratched from its form sheet – and the program announcement itself pushed back after South Australia went into immediate lockdown a day before it was due. Staging the international arts event in unprecedented times, organisers are still coming to terms with a massive hit to revenue from the 50% capacity rule in venues and an overhaul of insurance cover that will ensure festivalgoers and the artists themselves will not be out of pocket if another pandemic-led shutdown is called early next year. Only a handful of international headline artists will make it to South Australia, arriving early to quarantine before rehearsals in January and February, ahead of the festival opening on 26 February. But a number of international acts will now be livestreaming their performances into Her Majesty’s Theatre from their home bases in Europe and the US, on a scale believed to be most ambitious yet embarked on by an international festival. “At this point now we’re quite Zen,” Rachel Healy, co-artistic director with Neil Armfield, told Guardian Australia in the days leading up to the postponed launch. “One thing you can guarantee is that the situation will remain entirely dynamic until a vaccine is distributed globally. “So even though it was incredibly disappointing to have to postpone our launch, by now we are all very experienced at rolling with the punches.” Bearing in mind the unenviable predicament of Adelaide’s equivalent in Scotland (the Edinburgh international festival had to cancel the entire event in August), Healy said planning was in place to cover the worst possible scenario. Yet-to-be determined, however, is how game Australian audiences will be to pay for tickets, in uncertain times, for events that aren’t scheduled until the end of February. “I think everyone in the arts has tried to ensure that anxiety in ticket buyers doesn’t become a barrier to purchasing a ticket, that people don’t start thinking if the state closes down or there’s an event cancellation then I’ve done my dough,” Healy said. “If the borders do close again or if you’re sick and you can’t come, there will be an immediate refund.” The festival was not prepared to go into the details of the additional insurance hoops it had to leap through to deliver on that promise if called upon. But it is watching closely Live Performance Australia’s concerted lobbying of the federal government to establish a temporary interruption fund for the arts, not unlike the $49.5m fund already in place to get the film industry back on its feet. A handful of international artists will arrive well in advance of the festival to comply with the 14-day quarantine rule. American countertenor Aryeh Nussbaum Cohen, who will sing the role of Oberon in Benjamin Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, will arrive mid-January. The choreographer for the festival’s opera centrepiece, Denni Sayers, will arrive early February, as will New York artist Robin Frohardt and her team to install her Plastic Bag Store, fresh from its run in New York’s Times Square. When the first lockdown was announced, Healy said the festival believed it would be able to create a bubble of sorts. “We knew the [overseas artists] wouldn’t be able to go into the community, they wouldn’t be able to attend sponsorship functions and the things that festival artists normally participate in, but we believed that we would be able to create this bubble where they could be taken from airport to hotel, hotel to theatre and back again, so they could at least perform for Adelaide audiences,” she said. “But the second wave in Victoria didn’t just affect Victorians. It meant that the entire country had to recalibrate, and we knew this sort of model was not going to fly.” It was then that Armfield and Healy realised their original program would be impossible to deliver. They estimate more than 200 artists, including authors from the writers’ festival and Womadelaide acts, had to be cancelled. One of the largest annual events in the country’s music calendar and a staple of the festival for the past 28 years, Womadelaide has been pared back from a four-day extravaganza spread across seven stages in Adelaide’s Botanic Park to just four concerts on a single stage in the city’s CBD Park Lands. Salvaged from the wreckage was four major performances that will now be part of one of the world’s most ambitious livestreaming projects to date. Australian director Simon Stone’s production of Euripides’ tragedy Medea, created for Ivo van Hove’s International Theatre Amsterdam, will be relayed to a live audience in Adelaide’s Her Majesty’s Theatre. The audience reaction will be livestreamed back to the performers. Young South London choreographer Botis Seva’s Olivier award-winning BLKDOG will be seen by Australian audiences in the same mode, as will a concert by Russian-German pianist Igor Levit, and the Vakhtangov State Theatre production of Alexander Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin, which will be streamed live from Moscow. “It’s a grand experiment, we’re not pretending it’s anything other than that,” Healy told Guardian Australia. “But companies around the world are saying that we don’t know anyone else who’s doing this and we’re so excited to participate because maybe it’s something that we can all learn from and take into the future.” This is one year the festival will not have to weather time-worn criticism over its overemphasis on international artists – a criticism that has always been unjustified, says Healy. “Those who criticise the Adelaide festival for not being completely Australian forget that we are not on the eastern seaboard, and we don’t have a massive parade of international artists coming through our state on a regular basis in a way that Sydney and Melbourne do. “This is the only opportunity [South Australians] have – that’s 17 days a year – where they will see great international artists, without having to fly anywhere to see those artists. For 365 days a year there are local artists and Australian artists in Adelaide.” Many of those artists are in town at the same time as Adelaide festival, performing at Adelaide fringe.",culture
"Melbourne Museum will become permanent home to the world’s most complete triceratops skeleton, with the “immense and unprecedented” $3m acquisition of a 67m-year-old dinosaur fossil. After two years of negotiation and due diligence, the Victorian government and Museums Victoria have brokered a deal to bring the triceratops horridus – which was discovered on private land in the United States in 2014 – to Melbourne next year where it will go on display for the first time. “It’s immense, and frankly, unprecedented in terms of this sort of item of such global iconic stature and quality being in an Australian museum. There’s no precedent really,” Dr Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of palaeontology at Melbourne Museum, told Guardian Australia on Wednesday. The skeleton is at least 87% complete, measures up to seven metres long from tip to tail, stands at more than 2m tall, and literally weighs a tonne. Its 261kg skull is also 99% intact. It’s so finely preserved that even skin impressions and tendons are visible. “Triceratops skeletons that are almost completely intact are rarely found – in fact, are vanishingly rare for triceratops, despite its popularity, and iconic status,” Fitzgerald said. “T-rex now is almost a dime a dozen – a garden-variety dinosaur. It’s basic, a vanilla dinosaur … But there’s really just a handful, maybe four or five substantially complete triceratops skeletons on the entire planet.” The fossil was discovered on private property in eastern Montana by independent commercial fossil prospector Craig Pfister. Museums Victoria became aware of the fossil in 2018 and began investigations into its provenance and authenticity. A spokesperson from the organisation said they could not share details about the landowner in order to preserve the integrity of the excavation site. Fossil ownership and trade laws are complicated and vary between countries, but in the US, fossils found on private property belong to the landowner and can be sold commercially. Independent prospectors need permission from landowners to dig on private land, but will often negotiate deals with landowners that allow them to share in the profits of sale for any significant find. Trade in fossils can also be extremely lucrative: a near-complete tyrannosaurus rex skeleton sold for US$31.8m in October. Museums Victoria is a member of the International Council of Museums that requires the organisation to adhere to a code of ethics around the purchase of fossils. “Acquisitions by Museums Victoria have to go through an extremely rigorous due process, due diligence around provenance, and that includes a fully detailed investigation of the origins of any item that is under consideration,” said Fitzgerald. “That was quite an involved process, which is why it actually took some time just to get this point of announcing that we have acquired this fossil.” This particular fossil was discovered in an area known as Hell Creek, a place Fitzgerald said “for a long time has been known as one of the globally richest sources of dinosaur fossils, and indeed, fossils of plants and other animals that lived in the environment with dinosaurs”. Hell Creek was also where the famous “Duelling Dinosaurs” – a tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops locked in permanent battle – were discovered in 2006. Museums Victoria’s triceratops dates from the end of the cretaceous period, “almost a blink of an eye before the cataclysmic events 66 million years ago that followed the asteroid striking the Earth and leading to a global mass extinction,” said Fitzgerald. “The final moments before we transitioned into the era of life that we live in, the Cenozoic era.”Fitzgerald, whose own research in palaeontology focuses on the fossils of ancient marine animals, said a fascination with dinosaurs is universal in his field. “Anyone who is fortunate enough to become a palaeontologist is amazed and in awe of dinosaurs,” he said. The triceratops is at the final stage of preparation – the process of cleaning the bones out of the rock in a laboratory in Canada – before its move to Australia. Fitzgerald said he hoped it would bring visitors to the museum for “the thrill and wonder of seeing something like this, for the first time”. “It’s the right fossil for a public museum that has a palaeontology program to acquire,” he said. “It’s fantastic for public display as an attraction, fantastic for public education, and a scientifically priceless fossil that will inspire and be used in research for generations.” The museum expects the skeleton will allow the scientific community to properly map, for the first time, the full “atlas of anatomy for triceratops” and allow them to definitively answer basic “vital stats” about the dinosaur, such as how big and heavy they really got. “Triceratops is almost like the last of the big guns – the really big name, household name dinosaurs – for which we don’t have answers to those questions yet,” said Fitzgerald. Despite being about to welcome such a scientifically significant specimen to his home city, Fitzgerald said that the triceratops wasn’t his favourite dinosaur. “Dinosaurs are still alive. Dinosaurs are all around us. We call them birds,” he said. “My favourite dinosaurs are penguins, because they are the best examples of dinosaurs that went to sea … Penguins evolved, we think from a flying ancestor. And that flying ancestor was a bird.”",culture
"“This is not the time to get complacent,” said Samantha Bee on a remote Full Frontal filmed during the second day of the Democratic convention. “We don’t know what’s about to happen! Next week, the president is going to accept the nomination from the White House, or Gettysburg, or Epcot Spaceship Earth, we just don’t know.” Which is why Full Frontal’s theme for the 2020 election, Bee revealed, is “expect the worst.” Case in point: though there are valid reasons to criticize Kamala Harris as Biden’s running mate, such as her “controversial record as a prosecutor or the fact that she met her husband on a blind date set up by the director of House Party”, Bee noted, Republicans are “instead choosing to criticize her for being a black woman”. Bee played a series of Fox News clips dismissing Harris’s bid as “identity politics”, calling the California “nasty” and claiming she was just “supposedly African-American”. “If these attacks on Harris’s gender and race sound familiar, it’s because a lot of them are just repeats of the bullshit used against Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama,” Bee explained. Less well-trodden territory is the Trump administration’s dismantling of the US post office ahead of an election that will probably depend on mail-in ballots. “We already know to expect that Republicans will do whatever it takes to prevent black and Hispanic people from voting,” said Bee, “but it’s truly terrifying to see how the pandemic is allowing them to suppress voter turnout at warp speed.” Still, “we should allow ourselves to feel hope for the future,” Bee concluded, “and then we should get right back to work, because when you are dealing with a pack of decomposing racists, you have to expect the worst.” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah blasted Fox News and other conservatives for trotting out the “not black enough” line against Kamala Harris. Noah played several clips in which conservative commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and Dinesh D’Souza called Harris, whose mother was born in India and whose father was born in Jamaica, not “African American” or “American black”. “You can dissect Kamala Harris’s heritage however you want,” said Noah. “But to say she’s not black?” You have to ask yourself, he added, “is she black enough to get kicked out of a restaurant back in the day in the Jim Crow South? Would she have been black enough to get redlined? Is she black enough to be kept out of a whites-only school as a little girl? Then she’s black!” What’s “especially ironic” about conservative media “trying to exclude” Harris from blackness, Noah continued, is that “it’s the reverse of what white America did for centuries: defining as many people as black as possible, whether they wanted it or not.” He explained the “one-drop rule”, the historical practice of defining blackness by the existence of a single black ancestor, which was “never meant to accurately portray the black experience or many shades of blackness itself. It was made with the singular intention of finding the most efficient way to exclude as many people as possible from whiteness. “So yes,” he concluded, “it is disgusting that these people are now trying to exclude Kamala Harris from being black.” Stephen Colbert continued the Late Show’s live coverage of the virtual Democratic national convention on Wednesday night, during which Barack Obama delivered a fiery speech to introduce Kamala Harris. The former president’s address was “everything I miss”, joked Colbert. “Obama! The constitution! A president! Haircuts!” Obama admitted that he had hoped “for the sake of our country” back in 2016 that Donald Trump “might show some interest in taking the job seriously”. “Look, sir, I know you’re the guy who coined the ‘hope’ slogan, but even your poster doesn’t buy that,” said Colbert. Nevertheless, the former president transitioned from “no drama Obama” to “trash talk Barack” and said Trump had “shown no interest in putting in the work, no interest in finding common ground. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t.” “It’s true, Donald Trump hasn’t grown since he was a toddler,” Colbert added. “He’s the only president who still needs a sippy cup.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers discussed a damning report from the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee which confirms that Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort briefed a Russian intelligence officer on campaign data. “This is as definitive as it gets,” said Meyers of evidence for election collusion with Russia, “and the worst part is, no one cares because it’s old news. It’s like finding out now that the characters on Lost really did die in the plane crash. “I just want to say to the Senate and Robert Mueller and everyone, everyone else involved in the Russia investigation: way to slow-walk it, fellas,” Meyers added. “You couldn’t have released definitive proof of a criminal conspiracy to cheat in the 2016 election before Trump botched the deadly pandemic? “I can’t wait till August 2022 when the Senate announces that, yes, Trump did burn all the mail-in ballots from blue states the day before the election.”",culture
"‘Daddy, my Daddy!” With these three words at the climax of the drama, Jenny Agutter 50 years ago created one of the best-loved roles in British cinema – as Roberta in Lionel Jeffries’ adaptation of E Nesbit’s 1906 novel The Railway Children. Now Agutter, who is about to start filming the tenth season of the BBC drama Call the Midwife, in which she plays Sister Julienne, has reprised her role in the story of the three children who move from London with their mother to a dilapidated cottage in Yorkshire, suddenly impoverished after their father disappears. This time she is taking part in a remarkable project by a charity set up to help rehabilitate prisoners into society. Her involvement – which comes as the 1970 film is enjoying a new lease of life on the BBC iPlayer – reflects her own commitment to working with prisoners and children from disadvantaged backgrounds, which stretches back to her youth. The actress has recently become an ambassador for Liberty Choir UK, a charity whose work begins inside prisons – through weekly rehearsals of a choir made up of prisoners and volunteers from community choirs – and which blossoms when the choir’s ex-offender graduates leave prison and are supported by the team and volunteers. The charity has been grappling with its role in the coronavirus pandemic, with prisons not allowing groups to congregate and with singing forbidden. How can it replace that human bond, where for two hours every week people gather in prisons for conversations, and care for one another’s lives?  The charity – which I co-founded in 2014 with my wife, MJ Paranzino – has had to replace that physical engagement with the men and women in prison with virtual support. Two weeks after lockdown was imposed, Liberty Choir Radio was launched – a one-hour show of musical history, chat and songs, with breathing and vocal exercises (such as in the live sessions) and – so crucial, this – messages of hope and solidarity from the volunteers, supporters and the Liberty Choir graduates themselves who know so well what lockdown feels like, and can imagine this extreme version of it; some prisoners are only getting out for 30 minutes at a time, and have to choose between a shower or a phone call.  Liberty Choir Radio is also being launched with National Prison Radio next month to take the charity into every prison in England and Wales – more than 100, with an audience of 80,000 prisoners – so the charity’s delivery has actually expanded in this frustrating time, albeit nothing beats being together and singing together in a room. Our new ambassador was asked if she would record a message for the prisoners and also read a passage from The Railway Children. The line everyone recalls is when Roberta (nicknamed “Bobbie”) first sees her much-missed absent father through the steam on the platform of the local railway station. He has been in prison for so many long, anxious months after falsely being accused of being a spy, and when his oldest and most resourceful child realises it is him, she runs into his arms weeping “Daddy, my Daddy!”. Well, how wonderful for those people in prison to hear such a touching reading by Agutter – some of them will know the story and for those who don’t, the words would still be meaningful to them. Edith Nesbit, the author, was a political activist, co-founder of the Fabian Society in 1884, a lifelong socialist and unconventional – she was seven months pregnant when she married and lived in a ménage à trois. Her father died when she was three and she felt his absence keenly all her life. What tugs at the heartstrings, hearing Agutter read the passage so movingly, with the same slight catch in her voice as her teenage self had 50 years ago, was the line about how the father feasts his eyes on the flowers in the garden, such a contrast to the ragged tufts of grass erupting from the cracks that was all he could see through his prison cell bars. Agutter has been engaged in social issues and volunteering all her life. She is a patron of the St Giles Trust, which supports prisoners and their families as well as other vulnerable groups.  In her early twenties, having acted since she was 11, Agutter moved to west Hollywood. Not long afterwards , she started volunteering at a school, Sheenway, in Watts, south Los Angeles, which was and still is a poor African American neighbourhood. Only 10 years earlier there had been riots where 34 people died and thousands were injured.  It was a fellow actor who asked Agutter to take over from him at Sheenway, but what made her decide it was something she wanted to do? “I just hooked into it immediately as something that intrigued me, partly because it was a very different place to where I lived and also because I had been given so many opportunities – whether it was doing The Railway Children, or getting into theatre and ending up at the National Theatre, or going to America and doing Logan’s Run,” Agutter said. “And I’ve been very grateful, but I’m also very aware that many people do not have opportunities in their lives. So there’s a part of me that has a strong sense of ‘I can’t just live by taking stuff and not giving stuff back.’ ” Agutter recently sent an email to Dolores Sheen, the 82-year-old executive director of Sheenway school (established by Dolores’s father, Dr Herbert Sheen) in a gesture of friendship which goes back 40 years. “It was after George Floyd’s death,” said Agutter, “and I said, ‘I hope you and the kids are doing OK, and I’m so sad and sorry that these things we thought would have passed by now have not passed.’ ” Her “giving stuff back” was to introduce the schoolchildren to Shakespeare. Agutter recalls taking a group of 10 to see Richard III which was playing in an affluent part of Los Angeles. The head had given permission and a coach was organised and then “as the children are leaving with me, Dee [Dolores] says, ‘Now you children, you just behave yourself because when you’re out there people will look at you and they’ll say, look at those black children behaving badly.’ “And I thought, ‘that’s a terrible thing to say’. But what she was doing was giving them a message, which is that is the way people behave – so you’ve got to be extra on top of it because that is how people assume – will be about your blackness and not about you being kids. So it was a lesson for me to learn.” What does Sheen remember about the actress when she first met her? “She was a vibrant young woman, full of purpose with an exciting charm who was quickly beloved by the students and faculty, and thank God she didn’t change. She invited us to be a part of her journey, and we welcomed her into ours ... an odyssey that takes children victimised by a zip code to heights of freedom for their minds and spirits – the Sheenway experience.” But why have they kept in touch over decades and continents (Agutter taught at Sheenway for six years)? “Jenny holds a special place in our history,” said Sheen, “and I shall always love her for the gifts of hope that she fed into the dreams of our students.” As Agutter remarks, neither the St Giles Trust nor Liberty Choir are “comfortable” charities – “It’s not dealing with children or ill health. It’s dealing with people that most people want to turn away from,” she said. “People that seem to have almost no hope in their lives, and we don’t want to recognise ‘no hope’.” So why not pick a safer option for a charity to support? One with an easier sell? “Lots of people are doing that already and it also seems obvious to me that if you don’t take care of the most difficult elements of our society, we’ll never get anywhere because they’ll always remain.”",culture
"Airing as the second night wrapped, The Daily Show recapped the first evening of the virtual Democratic national convention, in which numerous ordinary Americans, politicians and celebrities launched a weeklong celebration and call to action for candidate Joe Biden. One of the first and most moving speakers, said host Trevor Noah, was Kristin Urquiza of Arizona, whose father died of the coronavirus in June. “His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump,” she said of her father, adding that he felt “betrayed” by the president at the end of his life. “Wow, that was absolutely scathing,” said Noah of her remarks. “And she’s right, believing Donald Trump is truly one of the most harmful things you can do.” That fact was true even before Trump was president, he added – “just ask Atlantic City, his first two wives, or any graduate of Trump University.” But the real highlight of the first night was former first lady Michelle Obama’s speech, in which she calmly declared Donald Trump unfit to lead. Obama’s words were both “brilliant” and “ice cold”, said Noah, “and what made it even more devastating was that Michelle Obama wasn’t angry – she wasn’t yelling, she just stated Trump’s complete failure as a president as an obvious fact”. Noah also appreciated that Obama “didn’t shame people. In the last few years, it’s been standard in politics to shame people who don’t agree with you, and don’t intend to vote like you. A lot of it is fueled by the toxicity of online culture and how divided the country is right now, but instead of doing that, Michelle acknowledged that there are people who don’t want to hear what she has to say, and then she respectfully and earnestly engaged with those who might want to listen to her, and asked them to back Biden.” Trump, of course, did not respond to Obama’s words well; at an event celebrating the centennial of women’s right to vote, he criticized her speech for being taped instead of live. “Not only was it taped,” he said, “but it was taped a long time ago because she had the wrong [coronavirus] deaths.” “Goddamn, that is one of the biggest self-owns I’ve ever seen,” Noah responded, then imagined Trump’s logic: “A hundred fifty-thousand dead? I’ve killed 20,000 more since then, you idiot!” For the second night in a row, Stephen Colbert processed the DNC highlights live immediately following the virtual broadcast. The first night’s theme was “we the people”, while night two pivoted to “leadership matters” – “which, of course, has forced the GOP to rename the second night of their convention ‘all qualities matter’”, Colbert joked. The convention’s second night was a “magical evening”, he continued, which included segments on women’s suffrage, America’s healthcare crisis and a “beautiful travelogue of Joe Biden’s hairline – it’s evidently been on quite a journey these last 50 years”. The key speakers for the evening included former presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, who called the Oval Office under Trump a “storm center” rather than a command center. “That’s a good point, but I don’t think Bill Clinton gets to lecture anyone on what should happen in the Oval Office,” Colbert responded. “Those in glass houses should not be allowed near the interns.” Several speakers referenced Tuesday’s anniversary marking 100 years since women were constitutionally given the right to vote through the 19th amendment. “Fun fact: my mother was born three days after women could vote for the first time,” Colbert said of the occasion. “That’s how recently [this was]. Another fun fact: women have been able to vote for 100 years – Joe Biden has been in office for half of that.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon recapped Michelle Obama’s widely praised address on Monday night, in which she used Trump’s words against him. Calling Trump “the wrong president for our country”, Obama said he had had “more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he’s clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.” “At that point, Donald Trump squeezed his Diet Coke can so hard it turned into a diamond,” said Fallon. “I’m serious, right after that, a doctor took Trump’s blood pressure and the cuff exploded.” Trump was asked about Obama’s “in over his head” comment at an event celebrating the centennial of the 19th amendment, and responded: “She’s in over her head.” “Oh, yeah, that’s a good comeback,” Fallon mocked. “That was her insult against you. You can’t use her insult – every third-grader who can’t go back to school the next day knows that.”",culture
"There’s a scarcely believable discrepancy between the chilled, hirsute and blue-eyed Luke Treadaway who appears before me in shorts and T-shirt over Zoom from his parents’ house in Devon and the character he plays in his latest show. In The Singapore Grip, ITV’s big-budget costume drama for the autumn, the 35-year-old plays Matthew Webb, an uptight, bespectacled, sexually gauche 1940s colonial Brit. Impeccably outfitted in linen suit and panama hat, he’s everything Treadaway, after months of lockdown, is not. In Christopher Hampton’s adaptation of JG Farrell’s satire (which takes its title from a sexual technique), we first see our hero crawling injured from the roadside, adjusting his specs after the Japanese have routed western forces, the very emblem of the out-gunned and out-thought Brit.  Then we cut to six months earlier, when colonial Britain is in its complacent pomp and Matthew has just arrived in Singapore from Blighty to bury his dad (an all-too-short appearance from Charles Dance). He’s also there to battle with his dad’s evil, grasping business partner Walter Blackett (a chilling performance of reptilian sliminess from David Morrissey) for their rubber firm. “Hold on,” says Treadaway, running his fingers through his enviable locks, which clearly haven’t been tamed during quarantine. “Sexually gauche? I’m not sure that’s right.” Well , I point out, at a jazz dance Matthew finds himself on a veranda with two beautiful women, both striving to seduce him. He looks so uncomfortable his glasses seem poised to steam up. And he has just been on the dancefloor with spoiled Brit toff Joan who, at one point, pulls off her bra the better to seize Matthew’s attention, but he scarcely notices. “Oh, I don’t think that’s fair,” says Treadaway. “I’m coming down with tropical flu when they attempt to seduce me. At the end of that scene, I pass out on the carpet. I’m not totally sexually gauche, just very ill.” There is, I concede, much more to Matthew than mimsy, repressed Brit. “He’s the antithesis of the people he meets when he arrives in Singapore,” says the actor. “He is a vegetarian, an idealist, an internationalist. After going to an alternative public school in Suffolk, where he was taught that patriarchal differences in gender shouldn’t matter, he goes to Oxford, then works for the League of Nations. When he arrives to claim his inheritance, he is disgusted with how workers are exploited by the colonialists and at the racism his peers show for the locals.” Indeed, Matthew is the prism through which we gain an insight into British imperialism and its baffling complacency, with disaster just around the corner. “And that,” says Treadaway, “is why the story is so resonant now. You don’t have to look far to see the exploitation of workers in a more or less racist way – and realise colonial attitudes persist.” He checks himself. “Not that I’m saying all Brits are awful. Matthew is an example of someone disgusted by his countrymen and trying to be a good person.” The Singapore Grip was the third in Farrell’s trilogy about British colonialism, completed before his untimely death at the age of 44; he drowned in Bantry Bay, Ireland, in 1979. The first, Troubles, was set during the Irish war of independence. The second, The Siege of Krishnapur, dramatises the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and won the 1978 Booker prize. The final novel was set in early-1940s Singapore as British hubris unravelled – and this new dramatisation is the antidote to such conservative costume dramas as Downton Abbey or Victoria in which ITV seems to specialise. It goes where the national curriculum fears to tread, showing the racism and greed that underpinned the British empire. “It is the very antithesis of Dunkirk,” says Treadaway. “We like our disasters, us Brits, don’t we? We imagine the best of us comes out in them. But The Singapore Grip shows Britain at its worst, which is the opposite of Dunkirk. We’re divided against ourselves and terrible in conflict.” He hopes the show will enlighten British people about the fall of Singapore, a nearly forgotten disaster. “Churchill said it was the ‘largest capitulation’ in British history. Yet most of us have forgotten it or never known about it, in part because it doesn’t fit with Britain’s self-image.” Treadaway and the rest of the all-star cast, which includes Jane Horrocks and Colm Meaney, spent 10 weeks in Malaysia, filming in sets that recreated a British imperial Singapore that scarcely exists any more. “We filmed a lot in Penang and Kuala Lumpur, where there were old buildings that served as villas for the British colonial set. I remember they were near the botanical gardens in a kind of rural setting, but as we filmed I was really aware of the modern city thrumming away.” He came to feel towards modern Malaysia the way he felt about Iceland when he was filming the Sky drama Fortitude there. In Fortitude, he played British scientist Vincent Rattrey, sent to an isolated Arctic town to research a disturbing outbreak of cannibalism among polar bears. “I came home just raving about these places. Their tourist boards should pay me really.” Did working on The Singapore Grip make you proud or ashamed to be British? “Neither. I’ve never really been a patriot. If there was a patriotism for all of the people on this blue and green marble floating through space, I would be into that. Otherwise? Not really.” But, he suggests, let’s not overstate the politics. “There is also a love story at the heart of this drama. Love in the time of war is always compelling, isn’t it?” At the start, when Matthew is caught in the attack, he has only one thought: to find the Chinese woman he loves and get out of the living hell that Singapore has become. This puts him out of step with another strand of British racism: sexual hypocrisy. Asian women are for sex, not marriage. A French expat tells Matthew that, in their concerns about the purity of the race, the British are like Hitler, a comparison not often made in a costume drama. Treadaway is happy to talk about the role at length, in part because he has had little work since. “I was supposed to be doing a play in New York right now, but lockdown put paid to that.” He won’t tell me anything about it since he has hopes it may still be revived. So has lockdown been terrible for him? “Not at all! How can I complain when people are going hungry or losing their jobs? I’ve had a much easier time than most.” He spent most of it in London with his partner Ruta Gedmintas whom he met in 2011, on the set of the music-festival romance Tonight You’re Mine. “It’s been very peaceful. I’ve been able to recharge the batteries.” Don’t you worry about the future of the theatre? It was on stage, after all, that Treadaway performed his most acclaimed role, as the teenage protagonist in the National Theatre adaption of Mark Haddon’s novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, for which he won 2013’s best actor Olivier award. “I do – and I do think that the arts are everything that’s important for humans. But at the same time, how can I whine about theatre being underfunded when people are losing their homes and jobs?” Instead of acting during lockdown, Treadaway has been making music with his twin brother Harry, also an actor. They played together in a four-piece band called Lizardsun when they were kids and starred, while still at drama school, as conjoined twins in the droll 2005 mock rockumentary Brothers of the Head. For the shoot, the pair had to be attached to each other for 15 hours, wearing sewn-together wetsuits. Treadaway spent 10 years playing in largely ensemble casts – a posh comedy stoner in Attack the Block, a mythological cult leader in Clash of the Titans , a PoW in second world war drama Unbroken – before taking on a job even more challenging than being attached to his real-life brother for 15-hour stretches. In 2016, he starred in the adaptation of James Bowen’s bestselling memoir about begging and busking in London opposite a cat. In fact, in A Street Cat Named Bob, Treadaway starred opposite two ginger toms, since one was deemed not enough. “You do a scene and think it’s come out really well,” Treadaway says. “But then they go, ‘No, the cat was looking grumpy.’ They have to use the takes that were good for Bob.” More challenging still, both the author and the eponymous cat were on set – monitoring Treadaway and the cats’ performances for authenticity.  One final question: what exactly is a Singapore grip? He giggles. There are lots of theories advanced in the drama, one involving a paper clip, and I have read that it’s a a slang phrase for a vaginal rippling technique used by sex workers. “Is it now?” says Treadaway evasively. Then he leans in close and whispers: “You’ll never find out from me.”",culture
"John Mulaney: his specials on Netflix were like an awakening. It was one of those moments where it’s like: “I should probably give up,” when you see somebody doing what you do, but just so good. The couple on the train [Caroline Aherne and John Thomson] on The Fast Show – I’ve always loved that sort of shocking humour: inappropriateness suddenly coming out of nowhere when you’re not expecting it. Terry Pratchett’s Guards! Guards! manages to absolutely nail it: it gets to the nub of what it’s like to be doing a hard job in the middle of a city when you’re trying to do the right thing but the entire system is set up against you.  The scene with the baby-eating Bishop of Bath in Blackadder and the Young Ones episode where they make fun of Rick for being a virgin; I used to be able to recite every single word. Duck Soup by the Marx brothers – my dad had videoed it one night on the telly and I was obsessed with it as a kid. The mirror scene where Groucho and Harpo Marx are trying to mirror each other is one of the most beautiful pieces of physical comedy I’ve ever seen. My girlfriend – she’s the only person I’ve ever met who isn’t a comedian who only thinks in jokes. If she ever decided she needed to get on stage she’d probably be selling out arenas across the world.  I was doing the Download music festival and somebody shouted out: “You did this story last year.” So I replied: “Well, you’re gonna hate Iron Maiden on Saturday night.” I was a punk about 20 years too late, and I used to have a pair of assless PVC chaps that I used to wear on stage occasionally. I think anything with no ass in it has to be the funniest thing. I’ve had loads: bits shaved out and mohawks and big spiky hair, and the haircut that gets called “the Karen” these days – I had one of those in about 2002. The funniest one was the first time I got half my hair shaved off. Half the people told me I looked like Gary Oldman in The Fifth Element, the other half said I looked like Hitler. Once, in France, I accidentally ordered a plate of winkles. They were like little rubber bullets covered in garlic mayonnaise, and it was bloody awful. Thirty. It’s the magic number when deindividuation occurs, the point at which teachers stop being able to control a class and individuals become an audience. Doing a gig to less than that is almost impossible – it feels really awkward. “Bulb” which I use in place of a swear word. You don’t lose the moral high ground because it’s ridiculous. It levels the pair of you immediately. Black’s Unwinnable special is available on gofasterstripe.com",culture
"The weekend before last was something of a post-coronavirus reawakening for cinema. The release of Tenet at last gave mass audiences a new Hollywood blockbuster to queue up for, albeit in a masked, socially distanced, hand-sanitised way. Its healthy $53m opening weekend was as much cause for celebration as the movie world has been able to muster in 2020, but conspicuously absent from the party was Hollywood itself. Tenet opened in 41 countries but the United States was not one of them. Owing to the country’s shoddy handling of the pandemic, cinemas remain closed in most regions, including the key markets of California and New York. So much for “America first”. Another development compounded the US’s humbling: Tenet was not actually the highest-grossing movie in the world that weekend; that was The Eight Hundred, a lavish, patriotic Chinese war movie. In contrast to the US, most of China’s 70,000 movie screens are back open, which helped The Eight Hundred chalk up $69m. Rarely has the world’s cultural superpower looked weaker. For the past century or so, in terms of pop culture, America was the party. If it wasn’t happening in the US, it was barely happening at all. Whatever home-grown movies or TV programmes or music other countries produced, they usually paled in comparison to America’s output in terms of sophistication, glamour and influence. Other countries might occasionally muster a world-beating movie or band, an Amélie or an Abba – and the UK has benefited from the common language like no other country – but these were always mere drops in an ocean of American pop culture that lapped every shore. Many are wondering whether the era of US dominance is coming to an end, with the coronavirus pandemic the final nail in the coffin. “Covid has reduced to tatters the illusion of American exceptionalism,” wrote the anthropologist Wade Davis in Rolling Stone last month, observing that Americans “found themselves members of a failed state, ruled by a dysfunctional and incompetent government largely responsible for death rates that added a tragic coda to America’s claim to supremacy in the world”. On top of its out-of-control pandemic, today’s United States is a place of economic decline, rampant inequality and racial animosity. It is a place where culture is now discussed primarily in the context of warfare. In 2015, Donald Trump famously declared the American dream dead, and since he became president, you could say that’s one promise he has fulfilled. Even before Covid, the tide was already turning. Sticking with the movies for the moment, the distant, carefree days of early 2020 provided another jolt to US supremacy: for the first time, a non-English language movie won the Oscar for best picture: Parasite. Needless to say, Trump was not happy: “The winner is a movie from South Korea, what the hell was that all about?” he complained, “Can we get, like, Gone With the Wind back please?” More prophetic was Bong Joon-ho’s comment at the Golden Globes: “Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” Those floodgates are open, and not just for films. Globalisation is a two-way street, and the US now finds itself receiving as well as transmitting. On the small screen, the rise of streaming services has given global audiences more access to the non-American stuff they have been missing, and the language barriers are coming down. Take Money Heist, originally a hit on Spanish TV. In decades past, a US network might have bought the rights to it and remade it in New York with American actors. Instead, Netflix provided a platform for the original, and it became a global smash. There are still reams of quality US fare being made, but now it’s in direct competition with German sci-fi (Dark), Israeli spy thrillers (Fauda), Indian crime sagas (Sacred Games), even British teen comedies (Sex Education). Then there are ostensibly “American” series, such as Narcos, that sneakily lure audiences over the one-inch subtitle barrier: Netflix’s semi-fictional account of the US’s drug wars in Latin America has more dialogue in Spanish than English. Key to Netflix’s success has been its strategy of producing shows regionally, rather than simply pumping out American content. As a result, local industries have been reinvigorated. In the music industry, the streaming revolution has had a similar levelling effect. In decades past, the US was the gatekeeper: it owned most of the major record labels, it had MTV, and it was the market you had to crack before you could really say you’d made it (sorry, Oasis). When it comes to the biggest acts in the world today, though, you could be talking about Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, who was judged “the world’s biggest pop star” by Bloomberg. Or Korean boyband BTS, who have had four No 1 albums in the US charts in the past two years and who pack out stadiums to adoring American and British fans, many of whom have started learning Korean to understand the lyrics. In August BTS released their first English-language single, Dynamite, which went straight to the top of the US charts. The most-watched music video on YouTube, now at 7bn views, is Luis Fonsi’s Despacito – the Spanish-language original, not the English version with Justin Bieber. Thanks to the internet, what were once regional genres, such as K-pop or reggaeton, are now part of a global conversation. And people who might have been local stars, such as Colombia’s J Balvin, Spain’s Rosalía, Nigeria’s Burna Boy or France’s Christine and the Queens, are now international ones. US performers now queue up to collaborate with them. It usually follows that centres of political and economic power also rule the cultural sphere. But the US was primed to become the world’s cultural exporter, says Lane Crothers, professor of politics at Illinois State University and author of Globalization and American Popular Culture. “If you think about when the movie and music industries developed, they were periods of enormous economic growth and enormous cultural diversity in the US, as vast immigrant populations were arriving,” he says. “If you were going to produce something that was going to be popular in, say, New York in 1907 you were going to produce it for an audience that was already globally diverse, at least in the European, western hemisphere sense of that word, and so you had to figure out a way to make programming that was accessible to people across cultural and linguistic traditions. So when the opportunity emerged, post-second world war, to sell globally, US culture had already had plenty of practice.” After the second world war especially, the US was mindful of pop culture’s soft-power applications. It had a pretty clear idea of the image it sought to project: leaders of the free world, the land of prosperity, opportunity, health and happiness. Even supposedly “anti-establishment” rock music was viewed as a strategic asset during the cold war – all the better to contrast with the boring Soviet alternative. Which would you prefer? Communist folk music or Prince and Guns N’ Roses? Soviet propaganda films or Beverly Hills Cop? The American dream was both a national glue and an export commodity. As economies have grown around the world, the US has had more consumers to export to, but this has entailed certain compromises. In terms of cinema, for example, international box office now makes up 60 to 70% of Hollywood’s income. As China has grown into the world’s second-largest cinema territory over the past decade, Hollywood has been watching with dollar signs in its eyes. But as well as casting Chinese actors in bit parts to whet local appetites, Hollywood has been increasingly careful not to offend the country’s ruling Communist party, which controls which foreign movies get released and for how long. That has meant cutting out all references to locally contentious matters such as LGBTQ+ rights, Tibet, Tiananmen Square, Xinjiang, Taiwan (even Tom Cruise’s forthcoming Top Gun: Maverick quietly peeled the Taiwanese flag off his aviator jacket) – basically anything political. As a result, Hollywood content is no longer dictated by American-style free expression but Chinese-style self-censorship. As PEN America put it in a scathing report on Hollywood last month, “Chinese censors are playing a role in determining the content or message of movies that are released worldwide.” All of this is, potentially, to little avail anyway. While Hollywood has been abandoning its American values, China has been getting better at making its own blockbusters, no less sophisticated and far more relatable to the home crowd, as the success of The Eight Hundred underlines (fittingly, it is the story of a brave band of Chinese fighters resisting foreign invaders). In 2019, for the first time, four of the top 20 highest-grossing movies worldwide were Chinese. They played almost entirely within China, and the country is not particularly set on spreading its influence abroad, yet, but it could only be a matter of time. Last month, the government issued a document encouraging the development of homegrown sci-fi movies as a patriotic imperative, though the call for “implementation of Xi Jinping Thought” could be a barrier to export appeal. As with other film cultures such as India, South Korea and Japan, the growth of the local industry is hitting Hollywood’s share. The coronavirus pandemic hasn’t helped with that. Now, as China reopens ahead of the US, Hollywood is still looking to cash in. Next up is Disney’s live-action remake of Mulan, a $200m fantasy squarely aimed at the Chinese market. Again, conceding to the pandemic, Disney is not releasing Mulan in US cinemas and instead putting it out on streaming platforms. Mulan is getting a release in China, though, and it will doubtless do well there, despite regional pro-democracy movements campaigning for a boycott on account of lead actor Liu Yifei’s expressed support for Hong Kong’s police. Although as a Chinese story, directed by a New Zealander (Niki Caro), entirely cast with Chinese actors, and set in China but largely shot in New Zealand, it bears asking how American a movie Mulan really is. You could ask the same of much of “American culture”. Even before Parasite, only one American has won the best director Oscar in the past decade (Damien Chazelle for La La Land); the rest are Mexican, Taiwanese and European. Ostensibly American stories in film and TV are often set in sci-fi and fantasy worlds (Star Wars, Game of Thrones), or they’re nostalgia trips to America’s 20th-century golden age, such as Stranger Things. The only vibrant areas of contemporary US culture seem to be those that have been traditionally under-represented: African American and female-led storytelling, for example, from Barry Jenkins to Greta Gerwig, Ryan Coogler to Ava DuVernay. Or those that directly critique the country, from horror movies such as Get Out and The Purge to Joker’s dystopian drama, Childish Gambino’s conscious hip-hop This Is America, to true-crime series such as Making a Murderer. Genuinely aspirational showcases for the American dream are hard to find. Does Keeping Up With the Kardashians count? It is a little early to be making predictions of America’s demise. Let’s not forget, the US still has a virtual monopoly over the means of production and distribution. As well as movie studios, that includes most streaming platforms and social media: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO, Apple TV+, Disney+, YouTube, Facebook and Spotify (Swedish-owned but headquartered in the US). If the US can continue to pool the world’s talents and use them to make great art – as it often does – that could still be a good thing. But if insularity, nationalism and ruthless opportunism are America’s future, the rest of the world might well decide it can live without it. If America has stopped believing in the American dream, why should the rest of us?",culture
"He was one of Britain’s most celebrated playwrights, whose work – including The Birthday Party, The Homecoming and Betrayal – transformed the theatre world in the 1960s and 1970s. But now, to mark what would have been Harold Pinter’s 90th birthday, his widow, Lady Antonia Fraser, has spoken of her desire to see wider recognition of her late husband’s impact on British cinema. Pinter, who was awarded the Nobel prize for literature 15 years ago, died three years later at 78, after a writing career spanning more than half a century. “I now have the agreeable habit of showing his films, especially the ones people don’t know so well, in a little private cinema in Soho whenever I can,” she said in an interview staged by the Chiswick Book Festival. Among largely forgotten gems, Fraser lists the 1989 film Reunion, 1976’s The Last Tycoon and Langrishe, Go Down from 1978, starring Judi Dench and Jeremy Irons.  Fraser, 88, who was married to the playwright for 28 years, said she felt his screenwriting was regularly overshadowed and said she held out hope that his screen work might be celebrated in a season of films for the general public. One of her favourite films, she explained, was The French Lieutenant’s Woman, which Pinter adapted from the novel by John Fowles. “It is the dialogue that makes it work so well. I love that film,” she said. Pinter’s plays are often characterised as “menacing”. His commissioned adaptations of novels for the cinema are wider-ranging, though still often stamped with trademark curt and sinister exchanges. Among the best known are The Servant, Accident and The Go-Between, each directed by Joseph Losey, but he also wrote screenplays for the stylish 1960s thriller The Quiller Memorandum, F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Last Tycoon, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale and Elizabeth Bowen’s The Heat of the Day, starring Michael Gambon, Michael York and Patricia Hodge. When Fraser showed this last, little-known, film, she said her audience were particularly impressed. “No one could understand why it is not better known,” she said. Writing for the stage consumed Pinter’s imagination, but Fraser said he had another routine for screen work: “There was a great difference in his habits. If he was doing a commission, which would be a screenplay, as he never did a screenplay on spec, it was work. He sat down and did it. Whereas with a play, he might work all night. When he wrote his last play, Celebration, set in a restaurant, we were staying in a lovely house in Dorset we used to rent, and one night he swung out of bed. I asked what was the matter. He said: ‘It is that waiter. He won’t let me sleep.’ It was never like that with a film script.” However, Pinter did spend a year working on a screen adaptation of Marcel Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past that was never made. Fraser met Pinter when they were both married and in their early 40s. The romance provoked media attention which Fraser said “would seem ridiculous now”. “We were two middle-aged writers, not pop stars. We were not Beyoncé,” she said. “Though it is probably good for the soul to have the press flocking around your doorstep, asking you idiotic questions.” Some of Pinter’s early work was for television and was shown by ITV after Sunday Night at the London Palladium. His second stage play, The Birthday Party, closed after a week following initial bad reviews, but he made his name with The Caretaker, first produced 60 years ago. It became the must-see West End show in a week that also saw Orson Welles directing Laurence Olivier on stage. It is also one of two Pinter plays inspired by real London flats. Pinter lived in Chiswick in the late 1950s with his first wife, the actress Vivien Merchant, and their son Daniel. On the way downstairs he spotted a homeless man talking to another resident. The two became The Caretaker’s stage characters Aston and Davies. In 1975, Pinter left Merchant for Fraser, having previously had a long relationship with Joan Bakewell, an affair conducted in part in a flat in Kentish Town, London. The experience inspired Pinter’s best-known work, Betrayal, where the flat is moved to Kilburn. Fraser, however, said there were “enormous” features of this play that were absent from real life, including “the non-homoerotic male friendship” at its centre. “He simply didn’t have that with Joan’s husband. It is irrelevant. We were very much together when he was writing it, and he felt it was his play. Not someone else’s,” she said. Pinter, who was born and raised in Hackney, east London, was a keen sportsman and lifelong cricketer. Expressing her sorrow that he did not live longer, his widow said she felt “he would have enjoyed [lockdown] because of the chance it offered to read and write; all but for one thing: no cricket”. The playwright had originally trained as an actor, first at Rada and then at the Central School of Speech and Drama, and continued to take acting work throughout his life. “He had always felt, he told me, that if his career as a playwright had not taken off, his acting career would have grown and got better as he had become a character actor.” Although in frail health after a cancer diagnosis in December 2001, Pinter continued to act on stage and screen, performing in Samuel Beckett’s monologue Krapp’s Last Tape at the Royal Court theatre in 2006. He died on Christmas Eve two years later.",culture
"British rapper and visual artist Kojey Radical was born in east London in 1993. He graduated from London College of Fashion with a degree in fashion illustration and his first EP, 23Winters, debuted at number three on the UK rap and hip-hop charts in 2016. His music mixes spoken word, hip-hop and alternative rap and grime to explore sociopolitical issues. He has collaborated with artists and musicians from rapper Ghetts to visual artist Hito Steyerl. His latest single, Good, is out on 11 September. Just a Touch of Love by Slave As I’ve been trying to write my album, I’ve kind of stopped interacting with music, but I have slowly been introducing myself to obscure pockets of it. Recently, I’ve been really into old funk albums. Funk is undefeated and there’s something very timely about the aesthetics behind black music from the 70s and 80s. My obsession has mostly been around the album covers. I recently had a little baby boy, so Just a Touch of Love by Slave has been giving me inspiration. The title song and Funky Lady are bangers. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Martin McDonagh’s film is about a mother who loses her daughter to murder. She wants justice and feels the police aren’t doing enough. She erects three billboards at the edge of the town to call out the police. But the problem is that the town is so small and is mainly old white people who love the police. They all go against the woman because she’s going against the police, even though it was her daughter who was attacked. The film makes really subtle statements about how racism is swept under the carpet in small towns like that. It was a hilarious but also a sad watch. Halfcast Podcast Halfcast Podcast is hosted by Chuckie Online, a TV and radio presenter who got his start in DJing. He discusses anything and everything – from the economy, and how black people can progress and build wealth, to why Wiley beefed with Stormzy. You never know what you’re going to get each week. I’ve always rated Chuckie’s approach to podcasting and his willingness to accept when he’s right and when he’s wrong. I think podcasts can be so opinion-based, and there’s often little accountability, but Chuckie takes his time to pay attention, which makes it a really comfortable listen. Sweet Chick This is a franchise founded by [rapper] Nas. It’s always been my favourite restaurant to go to in New York. They opened one in London last year. It was dope, because all the staff were super-duper friendly and accommodating and were fans of my music. It’s a nice place to hang out. I bump into cool people when I’m there, so it became this hub. The food is mainly fried chicken and waffles, American diner-style food but with black origins. I am going to go out on a limb and say it’s the best fried chicken and waffles I’ve ever had. Big Zuu’s Big Eats (Dave/UKTV Play) Being in lockdown, I was cooking from home a lot more and being able to see someone like me, from the same ends as me, care about food and really put their heart into it – and not really have to change who they are for the sake of being on TV – I had to respect it. Big Zuu does chef up, but I like it when he does simple stuff like a chicken burger – things that are familiar to me, but with fresher ingredients.  The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson It’s about helping yourself by looking at the world and figuring out the best way to exist in your own state of being content. To me, that was a big goal. It gets to the point really quickly. It teaches you that everything you do in life doesn’t have to be for the sake of public opinion, and the more you start doing for yourself and pleasing yourself, the happier you’ll be in the long run. The state of opinion is constantly changing and you can’t place your self-esteem in the hands of something that will ultimately change.",culture
"“I don’t know what’s going on, but I’ve got chills, I’ve got nausea,” said Stephen Colbert airing live after the final night of the Republican national convention. “It’s either the onset of Covid, or seeing 1,500 people with no social distancing, no masks and no testing packed on to the South Lawn of the White House. “I know Republicans like voter suppression,” he added of the packed gathering. “I didn’t know they kicked it up to voter extinction.” Before Donald Trump capped the convention with a nearly 70-minute speech, he was introduced by his daughter and “American Girl doll just following orders” Ivanka Trump, who boasted about working with her father to pass “nine pieces of legislation to combat the evil of human trafficking”. “And then I watched him tell one of those human traffickers that he wished her well,” the Late Show host added, referring to Trump’s friendly comments about alleged Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who was arrested last month in New Hampshire. The president’s daughter concluded her speech with a straightforward message: “Washington has not changed Donald Trump. Donald Trump has changed Washington.” “She’s right, actually, and that’s weird,” Colbert said. “You see, the presidency proverbially changes the occupant. It matures them, it ages them.” Colbert pulled up side-by-side photos of Barack Obama at the beginning and end of his presidency and joked: “The guy on the left looks like he should be persuading the guy on the right to give up his car keys. “But Trump doesn’t do any of the stuff that matures you or ages you,” Colbert continued, “like worrying about the American people or feeling responsibility for protecting them or evidently anything else.” Looking at Trump in 2016 and now in 2020, “I guess it’s true what they say: taxidermy don’t cracks-a-dermy,” he joked, especially when compared with Colbert’s evolution in the same time frame – “the last four years are like Trump is Dorian Gray and we’re the picture”. Colbert also turned to Trump’s keynote speech, a true-to-form ramble filled with too many inaccurate boasts to count, especially about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. But “amid all the lies, he did get one thing right”, said Colbert: “Americans are exhausted,” Trump said. “Yes, we are, after listening to you for 70 minutes,” Colbert responded. “But at last it’s over, after four nights of bone-chilling nonsense from America’s top trash bags.” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped the “extremely boring” third night of the Republican convention, in which Mike Pence – a man “so boring that during his mid-life crisis, he bought a minivan” – delivered the evening’s main speech. It’s interesting, Noah noted, how Pence has long been able to “hide so much bullshit underneath the veneer of a respectable small-town pastor”. While Trump says “bullshit in a bullshit way” – barely disguised BS, as in the clip Noah played in which Trump claimed to love the Bible but badly deflected requests to name a single passage. Pence, meanwhile, “comes across as a reasonable guy”. And the vice-president’s speech on Wednesday night was “Pence at his finest”, said Noah, “cool, calm and full of BS”. Pence doesn’t so much lie as imply, Noah explained, which is why he claimed Americans wouldn’t be safe under an anarchic Joe Biden presidency, which conveniently elides the coronavirus present. “People are not safe now!” Noah retorted. “Forget the riots, coronavirus is waiting to punch me in the lungs as soon as I leave the house.” Most egregious, Noah continued, were Pence’s boasts about Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, “which, to hear him tell it, was more perfect than Trump’s call with Ukraine”. “I’m actually kinda impressed by how much cow excrement Pence managed to pack in here,” Noah said of the speech, in which Pence bragged about the delivery of personal protective equipment in recent months. “What he doesn’t mention is that America was so disorganized on PPE that nurses were wrapping themselves up in garbage bags,” Noah said. As for Pence’s claim that Trump’s actions in March bought “invaluable time” for America to mobilize its response, Noah had a reality check: “What would’ve been even better was if you actually used that invaluable time, to actually do that national mobilization.” Finally, Pence wrapped up his BS with “one amazing, new, terrible” slogan for the Trump campaign: “Make America Great Again … Again.” “This new slogan just sounds like someone got hit in the head with a bag of hammers,” Noah said of the confusing rebrand. “Because what’s implied with ‘Make America Great Again … Again’ is that at some point during your presidency, you fucked up.”",culture
"Artemisia National Gallery, London, 3 Oct–24 JanIt looked for a while as if the most anticipated show of the year – perhaps the past decade – might be cancelled by Covid-19, and Artemisia’s long road to recognition blocked yet again. But tickets are now on sale. Italian Baroque genius, precocious successor to Caravaggio, fearless traveller, defiant witness against her rapist in court – Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1653) is the all-round heroine of art. She painted women as strong as herself: Cleopatra grasping the asp, Lucretia choosing suicide over dishonour, Judith cutting off the head of the despotic Holofernes with a vigour scarcely seen in art. All of Artemisia’s images are narratives condensed into spectacular single-scene dramas, and painted with the strongest originality. Indeed, she was the first woman to portray herself in the physical act of painting, sleeves rolled and sweat on her brow. This survey will include several self-portraits and many stunning images of women from history, religion and myth, most never shown in this country before. Along with actual court testimony and the artist’s passionate letters, it will be a phenomenal show from first to last.

Laura Cumming Summer of ’85 Directed by François Ozon; in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema, 2 OctAdolescent amour fou, accessorised with flicked hair and billowing shirts, and playing out to the Cure and Bananarama: the latest from the prolific French director François Ozon captures first love in all its naivety and DayGlo intensity. Adapted from Dance on My Grave, the 1982 young adult novel by British author Aidan Chambers, this heady, ill-starred romance was on (cancelled) Cannes’s official selection list, and is among the selected films at the San Sebastian film festival later this month. Transposing the action from Chambers’s Southend to a seaside town in Normandy, Ozon sheds his urbane skin and relinquishes the storytelling to lovestruck 16-year-old Alexis (Félix Lefebvre). Alexis is all at sea without many friends when he meets 18-year-old David (Benjamin Voisin) when the older boy rescues him from a capsized dinghy. It’s Alexis’s voice that guides us through this doomed love affair; his perspective that gives the story its super-saturated sense of teen melodrama. The result is a film that feels as fresh as the 80s citrus colour palette, and as heartfelt as sixth-form poetry.

Wendy Ide Sufjan Stevens: The Ascension Asthmatic Kitty, 25 SepGigs continue to be hard to stage this autumn, with safety at a hard angle to profitability. One recompense is the deluge of albums delayed by coronavirus. Even in this current bonanza, a Sufjan Stevens outing is an occasion. Sufjan albums tend to come in two forms – whispered and intense, or rococo and intense. The Ascension – Stevens’s eighth overall – lands with a digital crescendo in the latter camp. He has called it “a lush, editorial pop album”. Recalling, in its scope, the electronic maximalism of Age of Adz (2010), and coming five years since the highly personal Carrie & Lowell, The Ascension finds Stevens wrestling with our slowly unfolding apocalypse. Clocking in at 80 minutes, it represents “a call for personal transformation and a refusal to play along with the systems around us”. Tracks released so far combine this mystical artist’s wide-ranging spirituality with unapologetically pop treatments. On the elliptical, 12-minute-long album closer,America, Stevens conflates the personal and the political, combining a loss of faith with swelling digitals.

The five-part anthology series chronicles the experience of London’s Caribbean community across three decades, beginning with Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech in 1968. Each episode foregrounds a different real-life character, including Letitia Wright as British Black Panthers leader Altheia Jones-LeCointe, Malachi Kirby as civil liberties campaigner Darcus Howe and Star Wars’ John Boyega as Metropolitan Police anti-racism pioneer Leroy Logan. Boyega’s, especially, is an exciting role in an autumn full of great casting.

Michael Hogan Inside Story by Martin Amis Jonathan Cape, 24 SepMartin Amis’s 15th novel (subtitled How to Write) begins with a nod to Vladimir Nabokov, the author who, along with Saul Bellow, has done the most to shape Amis’s distinctive style. Nabokov, Amis writes, was “a very rare case: a writer to whom things actually happened”. As such, “he had every right and warrant to attempt an autobiographical novel”. Which is, of course, just what Amis is giving us now, a novel that appears to veer only marginally from the truth, a memoir dressed up as fiction. Inside Story, in prose that is disarmingly avuncular, self-revealing, digressive, takes us through the signature events of Amis’s life from cradle to late middle age. It feels as if Amis has found his mature voice, one that is warm, generous and deeply moving, whether on the subject of fatherhood, love or friendship (particularly with Christopher Hitchens). This is not only the best book Amis has written in years; it is up there with Money and London Fields as the finest work he’s produced.

Designers Sadeysa Greenaway-Bailey and ULTZ strikingly reconfigured the Dorfman as a St George’s Cross, torn bleeding from the Union Jack. Rafe Spall gave a tremendous performance, propelled by rage, taunting the audience with possibilities of racism. The same writers and designers have now returned to the National with a companion piece; they are the first artists to work in the building since it closed five months ago. Giles Terera, who was impressively chilly last year in Rosmersholm, stars as Delroy, the black best friend of the character played by Spall. As before, Dyer directs.

"After this summer’s protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, “there was definitely a sense that this could be the moment of systemic change”, Trevor Noah said on Wednesday’s Daily Show, in which he addressed the shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man, by two police officers in Kenosha, Wisconsin. “But as we’ve been reminded of yet again, there is still a long way to go.” The two officers shot Blake seven times in the back, in front of his children, paralyzing him. In horrific cellphone footage of the incident, Blake appears to calmly walk away from the officers, who follow with their guns pointed; they open fire into his back as he opens his car door. “I’ll never get used to how quickly police go from issuing commands to using deadly force,” Noah said. “Whatever happened to warning shots? Or tackling a suspect? Like are we really meant to believe that the only two options a cop has is do nothing or shoot somebody in the back seven times?” In the wake of the shooting, people have again taken to the streets in protest, which makes sense, said Noah. “Black people are tired of hearing ‘I’m sorry’ and then nothing happening. Because essentially what they’re really hearing is, ‘I’m sorry this is happening, and I’m sorry that it’s going to happen again.’” Noah also addressed the racist double standard in treatment and coverage of Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old white, self-styled “militia” member who is suspected of involvement in shooting three protesters on Tuesday night, killing two. Despite carrying his assault weapon down the street afterwards, three cop cars passed him by; he wasn’t arrested until the next morning. Rittenhouse claimed on Facebook to be “defending a business” but “that’s some bullshit”, said Noah. “No one has ever thought, ‘Oh, it’s my solemn duty to pick up a rifle and protect that TJ Maxx.’ They do it because they’re hoping to shoot someone. “Enough with this ‘militia’ bullshit,” he added. “This isn’t the battle of Yorktown. It’s a bunch of dudes threatening people with guns.” The police treatment of Rittenhouse was “illuminating”, Noah continued, in that it “really made me wonder why some people get shot seven times in the back, while other people are treated like human beings and reasoned with and taken into custody with no bullets in their bodies”. “How come Jacob Blake was seen as a deadly threat for a theoretical gun that he might have and might try to commit a crime with, but this gunman who was armed and had already shot people – who had shown that he was a threat – was arrested the next day, given full due process of the law and generally treated like a human being whose life matters? “Why is it that the police decide that some threats must be extinguished immediately while other threats get the privilege of being defused?” The answer, Noah concluded was clear: “The gun doesn’t matter as much as who is holding the gun, because to some people, black skin is the most threatening weapon of all.” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee recapped the Republican national convention, which was “scraping the bottom of the barrel for any trolls and rapists who have a webcam and a working CompuServe account”. “We hate to give these people attention,” Bee continued of the numerous “walking human memes” given airtime at the convention, such Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St Louis couple and “midlife crisis Bonnie and Clyde” who went viral for brandishing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters. “But we also can’t write them off because – funny story – the Republicans have shown a willingness to let fringe lunatics take over their party.” This is already happening, Bee continued, with the primary elections of about 50 QAnon believers in races across the US. While Bee did not want to give the QAnon conspiracy any more attention, “we should be worried”, she said. “I know it’s easy to focus our attention on the fact that the future of the world will be decided by one of the two people you’d least want to sit between on a plane,” she concluded, “but voting in November is more than just the presidency. Down-ballot races are our only change to right the wrongs of the far right.” Stephen Colbert aired live after the third night of the Republican national convention, which he has recapped all week. But on Wednesday, the Late Show host abstained from watching the spectacle. “Why should we pay attention to what they’re saying if none of what they’re saying tonight is about what’s happening in America right now?” he asked. “Why should we watch their reality show if it doesn’t reflect our reality? Why subject ourselves to their lies, which stick to your soul like hot tar? Lies like: Donald Trump cares whether you live or die.” On Wednesday afternoon, it was reported that the CDC downgraded coronavirus testing guidelines – those who were in contact with infected persons may no longer need to be tested if they’re asymptomatic, despite repeated evidence that half of transmissions occur before symptoms appear. The CDC was pressured to make the changes by Trump administration officials, which means “we’ve reached the point where Donald Trump is dictating our health regulations”, said Colbert. “Hey, CDC!” he added, snapping his fingers. “This is our lives! Either grow a pair and stand up to this clown or at least be honest and change the Hippocratic oath to: ‘First, do no harm, unless it makes the president look bad, in that case, bag ’em and tag ’em.’ “Once again, we are watching a basic function of our government, that has always been apolitical, die in front of our eyes,” Colbert said. “We are one news cycle away from the CDC warning that mail-in ballots give you chlamydia.”",culture
"Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, has defended his decision to move a bust of the museum’s slave owning founding father, after criticism the decision did little to address structural racism at the institution. As the museum in central London prepares to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown, a likeness of Sir Hans Sloane – whose collection was partly funded by enslaved labour on Jamaican sugar plantations – was moved from its stand in the Enlightenment gallery to an adjacent cabinet, which contains panels that explain Sloane’s collection was built on “European imperialism”. Fischer said the move was part of the next step of the museum’s work to place its connections to colonialism and slavery “very openly at the heart of the museum” and he said he wanted to put Sloane and his legacy in the “limelight”. Sloane, who married a wealthy sugar plantation heiress and whose artefacts provided the starting point for what became the British Museum, is honoured by numerous place names in the capital, including Sloane Square. But the move was criticised for ignoring the calls for the museum to take more direct steps to address concerns over race at the institution, such as diversify its curatorial team – it has one black curator at present – and return stolen artefacts, such as the Benin bronzes, which were looted in 1897. Dan Hicks, the curator of world archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and author of the forthcoming book The Brutish Museums, said he welcomed the museum discussing its past, but said a thorough decolonisation process “must involve more than curators rewriting the labels”. He said: “As far as I know, there were no public calls for Hans Sloane’s bust to be moved from one part of the museum to another. Instead the BLM calls are for the permanent return of stolen objects to Africa, and for the British Museum to take effective action to diversify its curatorial team.” Hicks added that the new text panels accompanying the bust fail to say the British Museum’s connections with colonialism continued long after its foundation in 1753, and “continue into the present”. Fischer said the museum is part of the Benin Dialogue Group, which is working with the kingdom of Benin on loaning objects back to Nigeria, and defended what he called the museum’s “impressive track record” on preserving cultural heritage. The director confirmed the British Museum’s movement of its founding father was triggered in part by the wider discussion about racism that followed George Floyd’s death. He said: “I’d say this is an ongoing process and this is a very important step we’re taking there. But it’s in the context of an overall research into the history of our collection.” But he added that he had another responsibility to “maintain what is probably the world’s greatest place to learn about the history of humankind in all its complexity and richness, diversity and interconnectedness”. Fischer said there was no plan to return stolen items from the British Museum’s collection, but added that the museum had a responsibility to be “fully engaged in dialogue” with museum’s around the world and in particular in South America, Central America, Africa and Asia. Fischer said that criticism that the museum’s support for the Black Lives Matter movement was “performative” and hypocritical was misplaced. In June, he was heavily criticised after writing a blogpost that stated that the museum was “aligned with the spirit and soul of Black Lives Matter everywhere”. “I was completely serious when I published that blog,” he said. “And I think if you ask the members of the black community from around this country and from around the world that we work with, they will tell you that I’m sincere about this.” Sloane’s collection also helped set up the Natural History Museum, which told the Guardian it has started a review to “understand the history of our institution” and its connections to colonialism and imperialism. “We will use this research to take a detailed look at our collection and our history so we can tell the full story of the origins of the collection and the people represented in the museum,” the spokesperson added. Fischer was speaking on the same day the British Museum announced it was reopening on 27 August with severely reduced capacity after the Covid-19 outbreak. Only 2,000 people will be allowed into the museum each day, which will give visitors access to about 9,000 items from its 80,000-piece collection. Fischer said the museum was abiding by UK government guidelines by capping the number of visitors, making people book tickets in advance and imposing a one-way system, which he said made visitors see the collection differently. He said: “I’ve done this several times to test it and it blew my mind. It was so fascinating and exciting. You discover so many things. You discover them anew, you see them differently because of that. I didn’t expect it but this is what happens.”",culture
"New survey data from the Australia Council highlights the vital and growing role played by the arts and culture in the lives of Australians, as the industries themselves face more challenges than ever. The latest edition of the National Arts Participation Survey, released on Wednesday and following on from reports in 2009, 2013 and 2016, canvassed a representative sample of 8,928 Australians about their views about and participation in arts and culture. The top-level statistics are impressive: few other industries can boast sustained engagement with 98% of the population. The survey shows a significant rise in both the number of Australians who believe in the positive impacts of the arts, and the number who support it being publicly funded. It finds 23 out of every 25 Australians listened to recorded music in 2019, a third of them daily; and 82% of Australians engaged with the arts online, the majority through streaming music. We’re also keen readers, with 72% of us reading for pleasure; nearly half of all Australians read a novel in 2019. Perhaps most impressively, all the key metrics are increasing – or at least were increasing, before Covid-19 struck. The performing arts were a standout: two-thirds of Australians attended live performances in 2019, with each art form growing their audiences. Live music was up from 43% in 2016 to 48% last year. Live theatre attendance was up from 30% in 2016 to 37%. Gallery visits were up from 33% to 37%, dance attendance was up from 24% to 29% and attendance at writers’ festivals and literary events up from 15% to 22%. We’re creating art in our own lives too. The survey says more than 9 million Australians regularly make or collaborate in the making of art. Some of the participation figures are startling. It’s perhaps not surprising that nearly 5 million Australians paint, draw or create visual art, and 3 million play music. But who knew that one in six Australians participated in community art, or that 2.8 million identify as creative writers? As with the data on attendance, the figures for creative participation are also on the rise. The survey data is crucial information at a time of crisis in the cultural sector. The coronavirus pandemic has led to the near total shutdown of the live performance sector, and led to crippling job losses in arts and cultural employment. Although the federal government and the states and territories have announced emergency funding packages, 15% of payroll jobs in arts and recreation have been lost since March, and the Morrison government’s $250m rescue fund is still months away from delivery. Drill further into the Australia Council study, and fascinating insights are revealed. Australians seem overwhelmingly convinced of the value of the arts and culture, with 84% of those surveying agreeing on the positive impacts of culture – up from 75% in 2016. Two-thirds of those responding said art and creativity helps children develop, 56% said it had positive impacts on our sense of wellbeing and happiness, and the same percentage thought it helped to deal with stress, anxiety or depression. At a time when Australia faces intensifying mental health challenges, this study is further evidence that the arts and culture has a policy role to play beyond the subordinate portfolio in a junior ministry where it currently languishes. Australians’ appreciation of arts and culture was reflected in other responses. Big and increasing majorities of respondents agreed that artists should have freedom of expression (76%, up 15 points from 2016); that the arts should be an important part of education (73%, up 12); and that the arts allow us to connect with others (53%, up 15). Significantly, support for public funding of the arts was at 63%, up 12 percentage points from 2016. When the survey looked at specific groups in our society, the value of culture was even more evident. Younger Australians, First Nations respondents, and Australians from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds all showed passionate levels of engagement well above those of the general population. Eight-three per cent of younger Australians attended arts events in 2019, and for regional and remote First Nations respondents, that figure increased to an astonishing 91%. Creative participation for First Nations groups was higher across nearly every dimension. While the blizzard of statistics will delight the data nerds, the study also asked more nuanced and qualitative questions about the role and value of culture in Australian society. Research firm Patternmakers’ Tandi Palmer Williams conducted some of the focus groups that fed into the National Arts Participation Survey. She told Guardian Australia that one of the key takeaways of the focus groups was “a fairly widespread understanding” of the benefits of art and culture – but one that wasn’t necessarily matched by an understanding of how arts and creativity are funded. “Most people could appreciate the integral value of the arts in the lives of children in their education, or in bringing communities together in social cohesion,” Palmer Williams said. “But when we talked about the role of governments in supporting that, there were mixed views.” She suggests that one motivation for this disconnect may be a general distrust of politicians delivering cultural funding fairly. All in all, the National Arts Participation Survey paints a portrait of Australian culture as an immensely vibrant and fertile sphere of our society. While the performing arts are struggling to recover from the devastation of Covid-19, the survey shows that for most Australians before the pandemic, the arts and creative culture was a vital part of their everyday lives. “This is really comprehensive, really robust data,” the Australia Council’s Wendy Were said, pointing to the large sample size of the survey. “This isn’t a specific sub-section of the public, this is a broader Australian perspective.” But the survey also poses uncomfortable questions about the support that governments provide for the arts, and it questions whether Australia’s cultural leaders are effectively articulating that value to policymakers. “One of the things that is really important is that this work was done pre-pandemic. It highlights where we were headed before Covid-19,” Were points out. “As a result, it’s a portrait of what we stand to lose.”",culture
"My friend and former colleague Don Steward, who has died aged 69 of cancer, was a curator of natural history at the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent, where he worked from 1978 until his retirement in 2016. From 1979 to 2008 he was also a leading figure in the North Staffordshire group of the Geologists’ Association, and hosted countless committee meetings of that branch at his museum.Don was born in Beeston, Nottingham, the younger child of Donald Steward, an insurance assessor, and Maude (nee Nixon), a busy stay-at-home mum. He attended Brunts grammar school, Mansfield, graduated from the University of Reading in 1972 with a degree in geology and zoology, and then earned a master’s in oceanography at Southampton University in 1973. His first job was at the City of Bristol Museum & Art Gallery, specialising in geology, before moving in 1978 to Stoke as the first assistant keeper of natural history at the City Museum & Art Gallery, where he was part of the team that oversaw its extension and reopening in 1981.He completed his museum qualifications at Leicester University while working in Stoke, and was later promoted to senior assistant keeper of natural history in 1990, eventually rising to lead the natural history section, first as senior museum officer in 2001 and then as curator of natural history in 2008. In whatever role he fulfilled, Don worked tirelessly as an active exhibitor and educator, and was particularly proud of leading a series of popular “RockWatch” sessions at the museum for budding geologists. As both teacher and curator he was knowledgable, informative and inspiring. With an easy-going, laidback nature and an understated sense of humour, as a work colleague he was caring and supportive. An associate of the Museum Association, Don also wrote various invaluable papers on the geology of North Staffordshire, and from 1977 onwards contributed to the Geological Society’s national scheme for geological site documentation, providing information on the geology of his local area. In retirement he enjoyed gardening and spending time with family and friends. He is survived by his sister, Susan, and four nephews and nieces.",culture
"I knew I’d found the spot when I saw a white and pink truck in between the trees. It was Saturday afternoon in West End park – smack in the middle of Brisbane suburbia – and I’d spent the last 10 minutes walking past picnicking families searching for Jaguar Jonze’s Brisbane festival concert. The concert’s time and location was never publicly announced, but there were several groups – some wearing the Taiwanese-Australian singer’s merch – already camped out on the grass. Staff in Brisbane festival uniforms burst from the van, encircling us with pink bunting. The side of the vehicle (dubbed the Bandwagon) lifted to reveal a bright pink stage, kitted out with mics, amps, and streamers raining from the roof. Jonze and her band climbed aboard and started their 30-minute set. Organising a concert and not telling anyone about it sounds like a fireable marketing error. But the people behind this year’s Brisbane festival promise it was completely intentional. Covid-19 forced the annual festival to rethink its largely indoor program. Unprecedented times call for unprecedented practices. With the self-proclaimed goal of “bringing people together to celebrate without encouraging crowd gathering”, the team scrapped its plans and devised a new schedule of socially distanced shows. The result? A total of 490 performances across 91 events – 73 of which are free – that kicked off on Friday, 4 September and will run for three weeks. Much of the festival is outside: artist Hiromi Tango’s Rainbow Circles (Healing Circles) – brightly coloured luminescent rainbow arches – dance across West Village garden every night; one of the festival’s few paid events is a live-action B-grade thriller that audiences can watch from the safety of their cars. Events are made to feel spontaneous, discoverable. Puppeteers, flash mobs and acrobats are expected to appear along Brisbane’s cycle and walk tracks over the weeks. Six giant finches, created by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, are perched across city landmarks. Walking home on Friday, I came across a socially distanced dance party and joined the 30 or so other people solo-dancing to Silento’s Watch Me in taped-off 4m by 4m squares. Perhaps the most innovative and ambitious offering is Street Serenades: a series of neighbourhood concerts taking place in each of the city’s 190 suburbs throughout the three week festival, from the back of a decked-out van. The event series was clearly designed with Covid in mind: all performers are locals (the Queensland border is still firmly closed), and while the list of artists is public, showtimes and locations are only advertised hours ahead of select gigs via the festival’s Facebook event page (a way of keeping crowd numbers low). Though considerate (and necessary), these precautions also mean that the pop-up concerts feel nothing like concerts. On Friday night, I watched Troy Cassar-Daley perform to two dozen people sitting on plastic chairs in a park along the Brisbane River; families and couples walking on the footpath slowed and squinted as they passed, as if they too were wondering why one of Australia’s most famous country musicians had been pasted into a scene more fitting of a local busker. West End park on a weekend afternoon was also a far cry from the underground venues Jonze has played. There was no moshpit. A gaggle of toddlers towards the front bounced out of time. A dog ran over and licked the heat from my hand. On Sunday, I saw indie-folk duo the Dreggs perform out of the same van in Brisbane’s eastern suburbs. As they went to introduce their last song, they stopped short: “I’d love to explain what it’s about … but there are children around,” one of them laughed. I miss venues so small and crowds so packed that you walk out wearing someone else’s sweat. But I have missed live music more. And I walked away from a weekend of pop-up shows realising two things. One: a lot of other people feel the same. As soon as the music started at any show, heads began to turn and foot-traffic slowed. Across the road from Jonze’s gig in West End park, residents emerged from their apartments to lean against the balconies. When the Dreggs finished their last song and moved to pack up at New Farm, the crowd screamed “encore!”. Every performer said how hard the last few months have been. “I’ll never take music for granted again in my life, let me tell you that,” Cassar-Daley sighed in between songs on Friday. Jonze, who herself tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in the year, looked around in actual wide-eyed disbelief and told the crowd, over and over, how “insane” it felt to play a gig for the first time in five months. Two: I realised that we are all willing to suspend disbelief to experience this again. In theatre, we collectively promise to ignore that what we’re about to see is merely fictional or fantastical. At a live gig, we promise to let go of the outside world and get lost in the noise. The Street Serenades required us all to suspend a different kind of disbelief: the feeling that this sort of experience jars impossibly with our reality. We cannot play away the fact that we are living in a global pandemic. Every performers’ set-list small-talk included some mention of coronavirus. Jonze took it one step further, noting that she had selected her outfit – a red jumpsuit covered in spiky yellow and blue blotches – because it looked like it had “a little virus all over”, before jumping into a grungy rendition of Britney Spears’ Toxic. But as the grass turned blue on Sunday evening, and the boys from the Dreggs sat back down to attempt a song they had written in lockdown, and a group of children started playing some sort of advanced game of tag in front of us, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that our lives have changed forever. Something precedented had become possible, once again.",culture
"In the mid-1960s John Lennon wrote some lyrics that would eventually become the Beatles classic In My Life. He later described his rejected first draft, which name-checked places near his Liverpool home, as “the most boring sort of ‘what I did on my holidays bus trip’ song”. In the original version, among the “places I’ll remember all my life” was the Abbey cinema in Wavertree. “In the circle of the Abbey, I have seen some happy hours,” he wrote. Fellow Beatle George Harrison was also a regular. By 1979, the year before Lennon was shot dead in New York, the Abbey, a magnificent art deco edifice that could accommodate more than 1,800 people in its vast double-tier auditorium, had reached the end of its life as a cinema. Now a campaign has been launched to save the building amid fears that its owners, the supermarket chain Lidl, could seek to demolish it and replace it with a purpose-built store on the site. An application for the Abbey to be listed has been submitted to Historic England, and almost 2,500 people have signed an online petition calling for the building’s preservation and suggesting its upper floors could be used for community arts. After its final screening – The Towering Inferno – the Abbey followed the path of hundreds of redundant cinemas across the UK. Its ground floor became a supermarket, and the circle was later converted into a bingo hall and then a snooker club. The most recent inhabitant, the Co-op, vacated the Abbey in April this year, and it was bought by Lidl a month later. Clare Devaney of Love Wavertree, which organised the petition, said the Abbey’s Beatles heritage and the building itself were of huge significance to the community. “Wavertree has been pretty neglected and there’s been under-investment, but it has a beautiful built heritage. The Abbey has architectural value, cultural value and a Beatles heritage,” she said. In its heyday the Abbey – designed by Sir Alfred Ernest Shennan and opened in 1939 – was illuminated with neon lights. The plush interior included a glass mosaic floor in shades of blue with silver stars, columns, sweeping staircases, walnut panelling and domed ceiling lights. The stalls held 1,126 seats, with another 744 in the circle, which had a licensed bar in its foyer. In Picture Palaces of Liverpool the cinema historian Harold Ackroyd wrote: “The striking main entrance and its semi-circular sweep continue upwards to the apex of the building. The whole bay consists of windows which diminish in height as the structure ascends. These are separated vertically by five columns of black faïence tiles, while grey faïence tiles are used to form the horizontal separation of the windows. The small windows near the roof are styled with Norman arches whose lines are pleasingly carried downwards.” The Cinema Theatre Association, which is supporting the listing application, said the Abbey was “a fine example of the best cinema design of its period, designed by an important Liverpool architect to be worthy of its prominent site in the historic Wavertree village. It formed a key part of the landscape in which at least two of the Beatles grew up, and their references to it give it outstanding national importance.” Another of Shennan’s art deco buildings, the Greenbank Synagogue in Liverpool, built in 1936, was listed in 1983. Ten years ago it was put on the Historic England’s heritage at risk register. Historic England confirmed it had received an application to list the Abbey. Lidl’s plans for the building are uncertain. In response to enquiries from the Wavertree Society, the company said it was “considering all options for the site, which include the potential for a new building of high quality design. Options to retain the building are being explored, but we do need to consider the potential to adapt it to meet Lidl’s operational requirements as well as the structural integrity of the existing building.” It added that the company’s preference was “to erect purpose-built food stores” but it had previously reconfigured existing buildings. Robert Zatz of the Wavertree Society, who saw films at the Abbey as a child, said: “We want to welcome Lidl but we do want to try to preserve something of a building that has a lot of resonance with local people. I don’t think Lidl realises the extent of feeling in the community.” In a statement to the Observer, Lidl said: “While we’re in the process of considering options for the site at Wavertree, we will be consulting with the community and stakeholder organisations throughout the extensive planning process.”",culture
"Issa Rae, one of the first black women to create and star in a premium cable series and potentially the hardest-working person in Hollywood, is putting in overtime with the aim of having it all. She is Emmy-nominated. She is Golden Globe-nominated. She is a writer, an actor and an executive producer, often all at once. Her hit HBO show, Insecure, which just aired its fourth season, has transformed her into the patron saint of black millennial creatives. She is the black Madonna, adorning endless mood-boards. Fans, black fans specifically, don’t simply watch Insecure, we live-tweet it, we argue about it, we create petitions for it to be extended to one hour, much to the chagrin of its creator. “We sold a half-hour comedy,” Rae tells me when I press her on fan demands for longer episodes, “and I literally have no desire to make an hour show!” A bad Zoom connection means I can’t see her, but I can hear the smile. She is warm, witty, and a total potty-mouth. “Even hearing people say: ‘This is how you can make it an hour, you can do this, you can do that…’ OK, well we don’t want to!” To the uninitiated, the 35-year-old’s rise to the top of Hollywood appears immediate, as though she exploded on to TV screens and into critical acclaim in just a few years. But to fans, her triumphs are long overdue. Next year marks a decade since her break-out comedy web series, The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, debuted. (It ran until 2013, on Rae’s YouTube channel.) Awkward Black Girl was the primordial goop from which Insecure spawned. And for both series Rae mined her misfit youth for stories. She grew up middle class, her father a Senegalese paediatric doctor and her mother a teacher. In childhood, her family moved a great deal, first to the primarily white suburb of Potomac, Maryland, then to Senegal, until they finally settled in LA. Issa was in the sixth grade then – an 11 year old. She was one of the only black girls in her elementary school in Potomac and then the only American girl in her elementary school in Senegal. She struggled to belong in each setting. When she started at a school in LA, attended by predominantly black and Latino students, she found herself the subject of the ballad of many black middle-class teens – “too black for white kids, too white for black kids”. When Tupac died in 1996, she attempted to find common ground with her mourning classmates and mispronounced his name, becoming a social pariah in the process. Before Awkward Black Girl, there was Fly Guys Present the “F” Word, a 2009 YouTube show that followed a goofy group of aspiring rappers, her brother among them. And before that was her first web series, Dorm Diaries, a satirical look at black life at Stanford University in 2007, where she majored in African and African-American studies. A fan of the wry humour of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm,  she was also heavily influenced by black sitcoms like Living Single and Moesha – and it was after attending the set of that latter show in the 1990s she realised she wanted to break into TV. Rae set about creating shows online that spoke directly to black audiences and simultaneously bypassed industry gatekeepers. Awkward Black Girl ran for two seasons and was financed partially by Pharrell Williams, who put season two on his YouTube channel. Rae was at the forefront of the first wave of digital black talent to successfully transition into the mainstream, something she doesn’t consider as crucial today. “People are comfortable with their talents staying online,” she explains. “Back in my day, there was like more of a, ‘Ah man, this should be on TV, this should be a movie’ or whatever, but now it feels like being online is just as viable and just as lucrative.” Not all web series translate to television, but when Rae landed the HBO gig, her profile soared. It is testament to Insecure’s quality that a 30-minute sitcom influences Twitter discourse globally so much of the time. Following the highs and lows of LA-based best friends Issa Dee and Molly Carter, Insecure fosters frank conversation within the black community on a myriad of invisible issues: mental health, bisexuality, open relationships. Yet it is, by Rae’s own admission in a 2016 interview, “a show about regular black people being basic”. Situations aren’t life or death and fans obsess over the messy minutiae of characters’ daily lives. It is radical in its regularness. At the height of season two, in 2017, social media-monitoring tool Brand24 estimated that the show’s accompanying hashtag #insecurehbo had a reach of more than 11 million. “It is a compliment and a burden that people take so much ownership over the show,” Rae says, “because there aren’t a lot of shows about us, so people feel like you have to tell all the stories that can be told, and if you don’t you’re failing us.” After transitioning from our computer screens to our TVs, she is now dominating the silver screen, too. Last year, she starred in body-swap comedy Little and this year, in two romance films: The Photograph, alongside Lakeith Stanfield, and The Lovebirds, with Kumail Nanjiani. She executive-produced both. She remains awkward at heart however, saying she “dreads shoots”, however frequent they’ve become (“I have a shoot right after this call and I don’t enjoy them, so I always have champagne handy!”) This increased visibility, as well as the added complication of sharing a name and face with her character on Insecure, has made privacy a priority. “People have a lot of shit to say and I just don’t want it to be about me, unless it’s talking about my work,” she says. “People fill in the blanks about my own life because of the characters’ choices, but I’m fine with that. As long as it’s not my real shit and it’s wrong then talk away!” This September, she’ll be playing a less relatable, easier to distinguish character – a billionaire’s daughter, in Jay Roach’s socially distanced comedy for HBO comedy, Coastal Elites. “Coastal elites”, the term, is defined by Urban Dictionary as “intellectual, educated, economically advantaged people in states like Washington, Oregon, California”. It follows five characters as they navigate the pandemic and an increasingly polarised political climate. “I actually had never heard the term ‘coastal elite’ until this movie so I’m just like, “What does this mean? Oh OK, it’s me.” Rae and her character, Callie, both live in LA, and they’re both “outraged by the current administration”. “You see so much of the concentrated fuckery of this current president in one place,” she says. “Hopefully you’ll watch the movie and say, ‘This is not normal. I should be upset, I should be outraged.’ Satire or not, we’re living in this and to accept this is to be part of our own destruction.” Coastal Elites is just her most recent project in an ever-expanding list.“Do I get burned out? Hell yeah!” she exclaims. “That was why I took a break last year, because I didn’t really think about how to do everything and do everything well. But it’s not just me – I get a lot of credit, but I work with really great people.” We spend a great deal of the interview talking about others: ensuring that everyone else is paid their dues, past and present, is a big priority for her. In 2014, she founded ColorCreative, an organisation which acts as a springboard for underrepresented writers in TV and film. She was inspired to start the initiative after reading the script of a young woman who is now a writer on Insecure. “Reading that [script] changed my life for the better and it changed hers for the better,” she adds. Last year, she also co-founded a music label, under Atlantic Records, an “audio everywhere company” designed to cultivate exciting new talent and empower independent artists. Whatever the industry, shining a light on black talent is imperative. “Because I’m a fan and because I love to see us win”, she explains. “Because I recognise how much it has shaped me throughout the years. Why would you not? Why would I not?” These community wins appear to slowly be becoming more frequent. In July, 34.3% of the acting nominees for the Emmys were black, and Insecure was nominated for eight, including Rae’s nomination for lead actress. If she wins, she’ll make history as only the second black woman to win in the category since 1981. A shadow is cast on the achievement by the fact that so many who came before her have been historically overlooked, however. It isn’t bittersweet for her, she says. “I don’t even see the sweet in it, really.  I’m not gonna be proud of being the second person, by any means,” she continues. “I was thinking about how so much of the canon of my childhood were black shows and how few of them, even in the best comedy category, have been recognised. I can’t believe Fresh Prince hasn’t won anything or even Family Matters – those shows have shaped, regardless of race, so many US youths and even the world youth. It’s astonishing that our talent hasn’t been recognised in that way, but not surprising.” While diversity within Hollywood increases, it remains a complicated conversation. Increasingly, black, non-American actors such as Cynthia Erivo and Daniel Kaluuya have been condemned for depicting African Americans in films (there was a backlash at British Kaluuya being cast as US revolutionary Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah). It’s a criticism that has been levelled at Rae herself, as well as her co-star Yvonne Orji, despite being raised in the US, since Orji’s parents are Nigerian and Rae is half-Senagalese. What does she make of the growing debate? “It’s just another way to divide us, unfortunately,” she sighs. “Seeing Daniel Kaluuya in that Fred Hampton trailer, I was like, go the fuck ahead! You transformed, you’re an actor! Sometimes I’m pleasantly surprised when I’m watching white shit and I’m like, ‘Oh! The bitch is Australian? That’s so dope! I would have never known.’” It’s these intracommunity battles that affect her most. In 2017 an off-the-cuff remark she made at the Emmys during a red carpet interview went viral after she said she was “rooting for everybody black” at the ceremony. I suggest that it cannot feel particularly good when it seems that everybody black isn’t always rooting for you. “There’s probably nothing that hurts me more than that,” she says. “You don’t want to be a disappointment. I know what it’s like to see Kanye and just be like, ‘Bro what happened?’ Or you know, Stacey Dash [a Trump supporter] like, ‘Girl, I loved you in Clueless – where did we go wrong?’ I want to make us proud and I think that goes to the Denzel of it – there’s just something special about him. He feels like ours, our movie star and he has done right by us.” Perhaps, I suggest, Denzel Washington’s spotless reign comes from the fact his status was cemented in a time before Twitter. “True,” she muses. “I mean, him being in that Julia Roberts movie [The Pelican Brief]?” she laughs. “He would be dragged!” As we gush about Denzel, she speaks about how much she admires his legacy, something that she feels is crucial in a world where 15 minutes of fame is now a near birthright. Sure, her impact is undeniable. But she maintains she hasn’t even scratched the surface of what she hopes her legacy will achieve. “As far as legacy is concerned, I have so much to do,” she says. “And I’m fine with that, but it definitely keeps me up at night. My feet aren’t firmly planted just yet. I’m still walking, I’m still paying my dues, in a way that I’m not mad at. I want to earn being here.”  Insecure series 1-4 are available to watch now on digital Styling by Jason Rembert; hair by Felicia Leatherwood using Lawrence Ray Concepts; makeup by Joanna Simkin for The Wall Group using Fenty Beauty",culture
"Then Crushingly disappointing follow-upNow Arguably the most influential album of the past 20 years From the moment I heard Da Funk, I was a huge Daft Punk fan, which made their second album all the more baffling. I loved One More Time, but what the hell was the rest of it about? What was with all the cheesy 80s references? Who encouraged them to put that awful heavy metal guitar on Aerodynamic? Why did all the vocals have that ridiculous electronic effect on them? Nineteen years on, every single aspect of Discovery has been pilfered time and time again, from the glossy production style to the sound of the drums. Every vocal in pop has that electronic effect on it, which I now know is called Auto-Tune. Daft Punk were incredibly prescient: play Discovery today and it sounds utterly contemporary. My review, on the other hand, has not aged so well. Alexis Petridis Then Overly cosy 00s knock-offNow Minutely observed and uniquely personal tearjerker When This Country debuted in 2017, I dismissed it as a sedate and sentimental Office tribute act. Besides, I had already filled my decade-ly slot for logically unjustifiable mockumentary with People Just Do Nothing – there was no room for yet another pile-up of delusional nobodies, awkward pauses and infantile bickering. Three years and an avalanche of rave reviews later, I decided I should probably return to Kerry and Kurtan’s spectacularly dull Cotswolds village with an open mind. What I discovered was neither dated nor derivative, but idiosyncratic and deeply specific, full of bizarre quirks and agonising bathos. The final series, which incorporated the death of the creators’ real-life friend and co-star Michael Sleggs, was a masterclass in the consoling powers of comedy. Consider me – very belatedly – schooled. Rachel Aroesti Then Pointlessly twiddly cartoon doom-mongersNow The full stop at the end of metal As a teen Smiths obsessive, I had been a bit of a snob about metal’s neck-breaking, big-shorted charms. That lasted until my late 30s, when I accidentally encountered Slayer at a festival. Within moments of their first howled, blasted, faster-than-hardcore notes, I was like: “Holy mother of SATAN, this is incredible. Why did nobody tell me!?” To their credit, no one replied: “We did. You were busy with Morrissey.” By the end, I’d quite lost the run of myself, clambering over other fans in an attempt to catch a hurled drumstick. I didn’t get it and, in retrospect, I’m glad. In all honesty, I hadn’t remotely earned it. Phil Harrison Then A fame-obsessed charlatan who hid a thin talent behind a big gobNow A hero of our time who paints brilliantly, lives audaciously and expresses agony and ecstasy with guts and genius When Tracey Emin was shortlisted for the Turner prize I found My Bed depressing, but time has proved her seriousness: blurting your secrets at 30 may seem sensationalist, but after 50 it is brave and even profound. I also got to know her and found she is an artist to her bones. I think I was a snob. Now I’m a convert, about to publish my second book about this razor-sharp modern genius. Jonathan Jones Then Twee Gen-Z Pinterest boardNow Delicate unpicker of emotionally complex relationships For a long time, I thought Phoebe Bridgers was an elaborate joke the universe was playing on me. Critics enthused about her tender, sad, beautiful music and darkly funny one-liners; all I could hear was a series of anaemic, one-note songs slathered in an off-putting veneer of irony. It didn’t help that her album Punisher, featuring lines such as “Day off in Kyoto / I got bored at the temple”, was released mid-lockdown. What were they hearing that I wasn’t? I gave up trying, until, suddenly, it clicked: the ghostly vocals slowly unravelling, the lush orchestration, the subtle melodies, the depraved poetry of the lyrics – annoyingly, exactly the kind of gently melancholy music I need these days. Kathryn Bromwich Then Icky high-school comedy that ends up celebrating prettinessNow Hilarious high-school comedy that delivers great laughs What was I thinking? Was I hangry? Did I need a snack? When I watched Mean Girls in 2004, scripted by Tina Fey and starring Lindsay Lohan as the shy, smart student who has to infiltrate a clique of popular classmates, I grumpily tied myself in knots trying to prove it was upholding the very body fascism it was supposed to be criticising. Long after that, due to my 30 Rock addiction, I became a Tina Fey superfan and saw the Mean Girls musical on Broadway, which was a joy. Recently I watched the film again with my wife and 16-year-old son and we all loved it. It’s just enormous fun. Lindsay Lohan and top Mean Girl Rachel McAdams are both great. I should have lightened up. Peter Bradshaw Then Another generic cop showNow A brilliant series about a superhero trapped in a horror movie I was mean about Luther after its first episode. Unenthused about another show about another cop who doesn’t play by the rules, I called it the worst thing I could think of: “Something that Robson Green should star in”. But as the series progressed, it wound itself tighter and tighter, wrapping a story about corruption and murder round the sort of terrifying jump-scares you only see in slasher movies. It was nothing like a generic cop show. It was actually a comic book in disguise. I felt so bad about trashing it that I even printed an apology. Stuart Heritage Then Derivative romcomNow Powerful play about frailty and the joy of human connection I still regret the rather dismissive review I wrote of David Eldridge’s 2017 play. Set in the twilight hours of a house party, Beginning sees a man and women teasingly and tentatively flirt, chat and – the clincher – eat fish fingers together. At the time, I thought it was all a bit predictable. Now I see that it takes real guts and rare insight to write a play as honest, open and seemingly “normal” as this. Sometimes a critic can cherish novelty far too much: more often than not, real life is the most fascinating and complex subject of them all. Miriam Gillinson Then Hilarious and heartbreakingly personalNow An unwatchable gush of mannered quirks At the turn of the millennium, Ally McBeal was event TV in our flatshare: lights off, breaths held, chunky mobiles down. Its celebration of eccentricity, embrace of mental fragility and understanding of loneliness and imposter syndrome – all pitched into a pacy, glossy legal dramedy – changed my view of how mainstream TV could speak directly to my young adulthood in the way music and movies did. Revisited today, it’s still all those things … but the killjoys who said it was unbearably twee and self-conscious, and that the ickle, vulnerable, male-written female lead was a bit dodgy, were right. It’s embarrassing like a florid teenage diary.Jack Seale Then A bloated Marty misfireNow The last of the swaggering crime epics Initially dragged along by the riptide of goodwill for Martin Scorsese’s Boston crime drama (Scorsese! Doing another mob film! With Leo, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson!), I recoiled on rewatching it a decade later. Nicholson’s over-ripe performance, Ray Winstone’s criminally bad Bawston accent, plot holes big enough to drive a truck full of stolen microprocessors through – this was a Marty misfire. But in a weak moment during lockdown I stuck it on, and now I’m a believer once again. No one makes these sorts of operatically overheated crime sagas any more – not even Scorsese (no, The Irishman doesn’t count) – and Damon’s clammy performance as conceited, double-crossing (closeted?) cop Sullivan, remains a career best. Gwilym Mumford Then Oscar-hungry jazz-hands blancmangeNow Armour-piercing love story with bulletproof tunes Even before its accidental announcement took the shine off Moonlight’s historic best picture win at the 2017 Oscars, I found it easy to resent La La Land and its offensively attractive leads. The razzle-dazzle nods to musicals past and knowing winks to Hollywood’s cut-throat present seemed like pandering to self-involved Academy voters. But at some point that punchy soundtrack bopped its way into my brainstem, and the doomed rollercoaster romance between husky starlet Emma Stone and jazz grouch Ryan Gosling suddenly felt affecting, even relatable. So yeah, I got it wrong. No need to make a big song and dance about it. Graeme Virtue Then Just another mindless reality showNow The pinnacle of mindless reality shows Selling Sunset does not, to the untrained eye, seem like a special programme. It is set in the offices of the Oppenheim Group, a luxury real-estate brokerage in LA with celebrity clientele (read: they showed Karamo from Queer Eye a house once). There are lots of female staff who morph into a magic-eye picture of blow-dried hair and tanned skin, while overfamiliar bosses Brett and Jason look like the products of an experiment to fuse Vin Diesel with the Mitchell brothers. And yet, I, and many others, have found it wholly, disgustingly compelling. While the Oppenheim Group prides itself on being a classy outfit, what has made Selling Sunset the reality show of the year is its undignified rows, soapy twists and Christine Quinn – a devious TV villain dressed as Lady Gaga circa 2008. Hannah J Davies Then Overlong, squidgy, coked-up messNow Flawed masterpiece (apart from Magic Pie) “I wrote it on holiday,” Noel Gallagher has said of Oasis’s third LP. “There may have been a small amount of cocaine.” And, my, does it show: every song is a swollen tantrum of back-of-the-fag-packet doggerel, pointless guitar widdlery and songs that just keep going, most lolloping in drunkenly around the six-minute mark. I used to loathe Be Here Now’s lazy, wasted opportunity to complete the perfect triptych. But time’s passage has lent it a certain black-eyed charm: beneath the static and squall the tunes are there, Noel’s nattiness with a hook undiminished. Everything on it sounds utterly enormous. And Liam’s voice has never been more pristine, more righteous. As a snapshot of 90s excess – a bygone age of pig-headed rock-star bravado – it’s a preposterous hoot. Although Magic Pie does remain total, irredeemable codswallop.Luke Holland Then Renegade cop with a massive gunNow Borderline fascist with a massive gun When we were young, the thought of running around town blowing away bad guys was a thrilling and seductive one. Clint Eastwood’s taciturn hero in Don Siegel’s action-packed 1971 thriller gave us a cool role model – and he had a great line in sardonic quips to employ at school (“I know what you’re thinking … ” etc). Today, Harry Callahan’s blithe judge-jury-executioner attitude and the film’s political stance seem deeply problematic: a liberal-baiting defence of extrajudicial police violence embedded in a display of macho posturing. And it gave us Death Wish. Simon Wardell Then A heavy-handed, “wake up sheeple!” political awakeningNow A brilliantly odd peek behind fame’s velvet rope Madonna’s ninth album, a dissection of the American dream in light of 9/11 and the buildup to the Iraq war, was hard to love upon its 2003 release. The title track and lead single was hampered by that rap, in which coffee enemas mingled with shoutouts to her Mini Cooper. But beneath the “money and fame don’t make you happy, guys” sloganeering, American Life offers us a tantalising glimpse at the “real”, unadorned Madonna. The gospel-tinged Nothing Fails and the guitar-led Intervention are glorious, unabashed love songs, while the bonkers Mother and Father lays her childhood trauma bare over splintering electro-pop. Her best album? Maybe. Michael Cragg Then A sitcom-by-numbers that acted as a death-knell for cultureNow At least good enough to watch half an episode of while you eat your dinner As a bristling teen/young adult I thought Friends was an obvious, pandering, saccharine American slushfest that only had six jokes (Joey is stupid! Chandler is sarcastic! Monica is uptight! Rachel is easily flustered! Phoebe is weird! Ross is a horny nerd!) and had one of the most irritating theme tunes in history. But now with hindsight and maturity I realise that Friends deserves its place as the sitcom to end all sitcoms: the cast is immaculate, the joke timing is impeccable. Yes, too many episodes end in someone hugging or falling in love for my taste, but what have we had since? The Big Bang Theory? Ten-season prime-time sitcoms are harder than you think. Friends made it look easy. Joel Golby Then Irritating bid for Britpop-style hipster statusNow Endlessly inventive and brilliantly funny I didn’t actively hate Trainspotting when it came out, but in the British cultural maelstrom of the mid-90s I distrusted it as an irritatingly self-conscious bid for hipster status. But I watched it again a few years later, when the hype was a distant memory – and boy, did I feel like an idiot. Really funny, properly moving and exciting; I couldn’t have been more wrong. Even Ewan McGregor’s total non-resemblance to a late-80s Edinburgh junkie (and having been a student in the city at that time, I’d seen more than a few) failed to annoy me; I could see his star-making performance for what it was. More fool me. Andrew Pulver",culture
"North Norfolk’s premier broadcaster is no stranger to the world of audio, but he’s really brought the boys out of the barracks in terms of funny one-liners in his latest offering. Steve Coogan’s Partridge shows the world the real, be-slippered Alan as he bravely goes Lynn-free for a week and fuels the rumour that Bryan Ferry can’t ride a bike. 18 episodes Phoebe Robinson was one half of the brilliantly funny 2 Dope Queens; now she turns the tables in this podcast that shuns ubiquitous white male interviewees. Jameela Jamil, Michelle Buteau and a pre-megastardom Lizzo are particular delights, switching effortlessly from seriousness to an eruption of knowing chuckles in their warm chats. 53 episodes MC Grindah and the People Just Do Nothing crew discuss music, fashion, relationships and more in their blundering and inimitable style. Chabuddy G’s “massive fashion interview” is a thing of beauty, just like his nipple-chafing pleather vest. Don’t miss their history of music, starting with classical (“No bass and no drums?

One of the best comes an hour and two minutes into episode 29, when Louis Theroux demonstrates his a cappella falsetto of Baccara’s Yes Sir, I Can Boogie. And then goes on slightly longer than is comfortable. 130 episodes The lascivious tale of Belinda Blumenthal flipping her vaginal lid in an ornamental maze is a pioneer of the laugh-out-loud-on-public-transport genre. Jamie Morton, Alice Levine and James Cooper’s dissection of distinctly unerotic dad-penned fiction spawned a world tour and an HBO special. Five seasons A fictional US megachurch lends itself very well to improvised satire in Holly Laurent and Greg Hess’s masterclass of weirdness.

As is tradition in the genre, the police missed a lot of clues so it’s up to David Pascall to investigate when a teenage girl is murdered in the town of Bluff Springs. Plinky-plonk piano, 911 calls and fast-talking waitresses blend with a big dose of absurdity. Eight episodes Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine are Joan and Jericha, agony aunts and purveyors of the world’s funniest and filthiest podcast.

"Nonie Chapman has fond memories of Winston Churchill shuffling to the front row of his personal cinema, wearing his monogrammed slippers and a vibrant green one-piece velvet siren suit, and of course smoking a cigar. She was a 21-year-old secretary. He was in the final years of his life. He cut a memorable figure but what she most vividly recalls are his hands. “When his cigar went out a male nurse used to go round and relight it for him and I’ll never forget his amazingly long, artistic fingers … they really struck me.” Chapman was reminiscing to the Guardian in the newly restored secretaries’ room at Churchill’s grand country house Chartwell, in Kent. The restoration of the room is part of a £7.1m National Trust project launched in 2016 to acquire for the nation hundreds of objects and heirlooms, from personal mementoes to gifts from around the world, from the Churchill family. On Friday it was announced that the project had been successful. The objects, which have been on long-term loan to Chartwell, include the Nobel prize for literature given to Churchill in 1953, his wooden speech box and a book signed by every member of parliament, minus Sinn Féin MPs, as a present on his 80th birthday in 1954. Chartwell’s secretaries’ room has been recreated as it was in the 1950s with the help of photos and memories of people who worked there. Chapman is one of those, although she was less a secretary and more a general factotum at the start. “I did anything people wanted me to do … shopping, fetch people from the station, help out in the office.” On a Friday she would take films that the family had watched to the station and collect new ones. “I’d also collect the live bait for the golden orfe,” she recalled. “Sir Winston used to feed the golden orfe.” Chapman said it was a welcoming house and she too was invited to watch Saturday night films in the private cinema. “I remember watching Lawrence of Arabia and what was probably the first James Bond film. They were an amazing family to work for, you could go where you wanted, they were very friendly. The house had a wonderful atmosphere.” After Churchill’s death, she was employed in London as a secretary, driver and companion to his widow, Clementine. The new secretaries’ room has typewriters, telephones, address books and inkwells. On one wall are photographs of important political and military figures including Charles de Gaulle and Field Marshal Montgomery. On another is a map case given to Churchill as a Christmas present by President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1943. Katherine Carter, a senior collections and house manager, said one of the star acquisitions was the Chartwell visitors’ book, which spanned the entire time the Churchills were there from the 1920s to the 1960s. There are lots of family entries but also figures such as Charlie Chaplin, Vivien Leigh, Christabel Pankhurst and President Harry Truman. “It is a real who’s who,” Carter said. A digital version of the book is also now available at Chartwell telling dozens of new stories thanks to the project. “We’ve undertaken a huge amount or research,” said Carter. “There are well over 700 names in the book and when we started, 132 of them had been deemed indecipherable. Now we have all but four. It is a wonderful insight to life here that we never had before … we are so lucky to have volunteer researchers who have devoted thousands of hours to this.” Other acquisitions include a lion sculpture given to Churchill by the people of Luxembourg, which he used to pat on his way to his office; a pair of hairbrushes made from wood from the deck of the second world war ship HMS Exeter; and a miniature paintbox. Chartwell’s gardens have been open over the summer and the house reopens on Monday for people pre-booking tickets. Visitors will also see a dramatic redisplay of Churchill’s art studio with 141 of his paintings. Churchill was famously a gargantuan drinker, enjoying champagne and brandy at lunch and dinner. As he got older he would drink whisky and soda through the day after breakfast, and the art studio nods to that with a decanter of a whisky and soda siphon near his easel. Carter cautioned against judging too harshly, however. “The whisky only just covered the bottom of the glass,” she said. “It was something he began doing in India. He used to call it his mouthwash.”",culture
"“I’m a Bauhaus-educated chap,” Terence Conran told Vanity Fair last year, before spelling out his philosophy of design, that objects should be “economic, plain, simple and useful”.  On these points he was remarkably consistent: he would have said something very similar at any time in the past seven decades, ever since he was a student at what was then called the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, or even at the design-aware Bryanston School in Dorset. He was, to be more precise, a product of that version of modernism that developed around the Festival of Britain of 1951, on which he had worked. As also expressed in the Victoria and Albert Museum’s influential Britain Can Make It exhibition of 1946, it was the idea that postwar Britain could, with the help of enlightened modern design, both enhance the quality of everyday life and rediscover its ability to make things. The ideals of William Morris, as interpreted by continental modernists, were to be reimported for the good of the nation. The means of this transformation, however, turned out not to be an enlightened socialist state, but the consumer culture of the 1960s, which Conran’s skill and nerve as a businessman turned to his advantage. His most famous achievements were shops – most notably Habitat and later the Conran Shop – and restaurants. His first business venture, The Soup Kitchen, grew out of his experience working in a Paris restaurant, where staff stole steaks by strapping them to their inside legs. It would be harder, was Conran’s thinking, to steal soup. These shops and restaurants really did change the visual and gastronomic culture of the country. It has often and accurately been pointed out that, along with the cookery writer Elizabeth David and the fashion designer Mary Quant, he helped to bring some continentally inspired joie de vivre to what was a drab place. “It is hard to overstate how uninteresting London was then,” he said of his early years in the city, “it really was the era of Spam fritters.” Conran’s most cited achievements include the introduction or popularisation of such things as flat-pack furniture, paper lanterns, duvets, espresso machines and woks. Also the chicken brick, a once-popular terracotta device for cooking poultry. His many restaurants played a leading role in transforming Britain’s reputation as a gastronomic wasteland. If none of these innovations were essential to existence, they could certainly add to the enjoyment of it – Conran’s claim that his promotion of duvets “undoubtedly changed the sex life of Europe” was only partly hyperbolic. Ultimately Conran’s work was about pleasure, about making a sort of tasteful hedonism widespread. His personal life, with four marriages and many affairs, might also be said to have been about pleasure, although with sometimes spectacular divorces and widely reported family tensions that belied the calm of his design aesthetic. If Conran’s core clientele was a certain kind of metropolitan buyer and diner, his influence can be seen in the products of Ikea, in restaurant menus all over the country, in the popularity of what now gets called “contemporary design”. At the same time he never ceased in his ambition to restore British manufacturing greatness through the power of design. To this end he founded and generously supported the Design Museum, founded in 1989 near Tower Bridge and since 2016 located in the former Commonwealth Institute in Kensington. He also supported younger designers, for example giving Thomas Heatherwick his first break when he was straight out of college, the design of a gazebo in the garden of Conran’s country house of Barton Court in Berkshire. Conran the businessman did well in the era of Margaret Thatcher, including through canny property development, but he never accepted her politics. “One of the most odious people who’ve ever walked the earth,” he called her. She, for her part, was outraged that the Design Museum’s displays included objects made by foreigners. Conran found Tony Blair much more congenial, and the feeling was mutual, at least until Conran opposed the invasion of Iraq. He was a prominent representative of Cool Britannia, of the young-at-heart and stylish country that New Labour wished to promote. The Blairs entertained the Clintons at Conran’s Pont de la Tour restaurant. When the French president Jacques Chirac visited for a summit, Conran designed the setting“I’ve seen the fuchsia and it works”, wrote the Daily Telegraph columnist Boris Johnson. Conran never liked the suggestion that he was a businessman more than a designer, claiming that he hadn’t known what “entrepreneur” meant. But it was in bringing modern design to a wider market that his greatest achievements lay. There’s not a Conran chair or a Conran interior that really sticks in the memory, as there were by, say, Charles and Ray Eames or Eileen Grey, and he was never avant-garde. What he did do, though, as he put it, “was to make things available”.",culture
"Photographer Misan Harriman is gently cajoling actor Shaun Parkes as the sun burns through the morning cloud above St Michael’s church in Ladbroke Grove, west London. “Look at me as if you’re searching for redemption,” he says, as Parkes looks down the lens. “But it’s redemption for something you haven’t even done.” Parkes, who rose to prominence as a raver in Human Traffic but now has flecks of grey in his beard, doesn’t ask for more clarity; he simply flashes a look at the camera and then slowly changes pose. Today Parkes and Harriman, who recently shot Vogue’s “Activism Now” September issue, along with portraits of Black Lives Matter protesters, are revisiting the west London area that is the setting of Steve McQueen’s new film, Mangrove. It’s a glorious September morning and, despite the Covid-19 restrictions, the cafes are busy and the flower shops open. It’s hard to imagine that 50 years earlier, a few streets away, there was a pitched battle between the police and protesters that would help change the way Britain thought about race. Parkes plays Frank Crichlow, the real-life figure at the heart of McQueen’s film, which centres on Notting Hill’s Mangrove restaurant and nine West Indians who fought police harassment and then a court case. The look of redemption that Harriman is searching for is something Crichlow and the Mangrove Nine earned the hard way. In the first four films of his career, McQueen has taken on slavery (12 Years A Slave), sex addiction (Shame), the story of Bobby Sands (Hunger) and a remake of a Lynda La Plante heist TV series (Widows). When I catch up with him on the phone, I ask why it has taken him so long to work on a project about the London he grew up in? “Things sometimes need distance and time, and maturity and understanding,” he says. “You grapple with your past. You grapple with things that are so close to you, perhaps more so than things that are seemingly distant. It’s almost under your chin. You need to work it out yourself.” Mangrove has been worth the wait: this is McQueen at the peak of his powers, dedicating his undivided attention to a forgotten moment in British history. That adjective, “British”, is crucial, McQueen says. “It’s essential. You know what’s interesting is that this is important British history, not just black history or West Indian history – this is important English-British history.” Rochenda Sandall, who plays Barbara Beese, a former member of the British Black Panthers and one of the Mangrove Nine, goes further: “It should be part of the curriculum. The only way forward is getting a 360-degree view of everyone’s history in this country. It has been whitewashed for too long.” McQueen wasn’t very familiar with the Mangrove case until recently, despite a family connection to one of the Nine. His father, Philbert, and activist Rhodan Gordon grew up together in Grenada and were close friends. McQueen’s father was a regular at the Mangrove restaurant, and at Gordon’s own Notting Hill restaurant, Back-a-Yard. But even so, McQueen says, the story of the Mangrove case didn’t linger. “It was one of those things that, once it passed, it passed,” he says. “People had so much shit to deal with, it was coming at you every day. It wasn’t something that you harked back to.” This was the era of the “sus” laws, which were disproportionately used against black people, and meant police officers could detain anyone they believed had “intent to commit an arrestable offence”. Meanwhile, the 1971 Immigration Act ended the automatic right of Commonwealth workers to settle in Britain, following the interventions of Enoch Powell, who had been lobbying for a large-scale repatriation scheme for immigrants. The Mangrove restaurant opened in 1968. Crichlow, a Trinidadian entrepreneur, had already opened one other place in London, the El Rio Cafe, which became notorious as one of Christine Keeler and Stephen Ward’s regular hangouts in the aftermath of the Profumo affair. The Mangrove, as Parkes’ Crichlow repeatedly argues in the film, would be different: a restaurant, not a nightspot synonymous with vice. Drugs were banned; waiters wore white uniforms. It became a key meeting place for London’s black community, hosting everyone from intellectuals and activists such as Darcus Howe, Altheia Jones-LeCointe and CLR James, to musicians including Nina Simone, Sammy Davis Jr, Bob Marley, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross and Jimi Hendrix. But its popularity made it a target for west London’s police, who constantly raided the Mangrove, ostensibly to seize drugs that were never found. In the first half of McQueen’s film, the tension builds as “the heavy mob”, a group of officers who patrolled the community like a colonial army, harass and assault black people with impunity. The police raided the Mangrove 12 times between January 1969 and July 1970, and Crichlow became locked in licensing disputes with the local council. In the film, we see Parkes’ Crichlow repeatedly pick up the pieces of his life, and witness his transition from restaurateur to reluctant activist. “It’s about community and the environment Frank Crichlow created for locals, activists, intellectuals and artists,” McQueen says of the film. “He was a hero, even though he didn’t set out to be one.” With encouragement from Howe, Jones-LeCointe and the British Black Panthers, Crichlow eventually staged a protest on Sunday 9 August 1970. In a 1970s documentary, Jones-LeCointe tells an interviewer that the demonstration actively exploded the myth created by the state that black people are “criminals, ponces and prostitutes”. And things did explode. More than 700 officers were on hand for the march, including 588 constables, 84 sergeants, 29 inspectors and four chief inspectors, according to documents unearthed by historian Paul Field. There were also plainclothes policemen and special branch detectives present, for a protest that drew just 150 West Indians from all over London. The plan was to protest outside west London police stations, but things descended into chaos on the residential Portnall Road, which the police claimed was entirely the fault of the protesters. In total, 24 police officers were injured and 19 arrests made. It became front page news, with headlines in the Daily Mirror (“17 Police Injured in a Mob Attack”) and the Daily Mail (“Police Hurt by Black Power Mob”) typical of a media that parroted the official version of events and played into fears about black militants and immigration. Crichlow, Jones-LeCointe and Howe were eventually charged, along with Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis, Barbara Beese, Rothwell Kentish and Godfrey Millett. In 1971, the Mangrove Nine began a 55-day trial at the Old Bailey, accused of incitement to riot, affray and – in some instances – attacking police officers. Jones-LeCointe and Howe decided to represent themselves, a tactic that allowed them to interrogate the state’s witnesses, in effect putting the entire process on trial. Assisted by defence barrister Ian MacDonald, who represented the rest of the Nine, they pulled at each loose thread to expose racial bias. The strategy worked: all nine defendants were acquitted of the main charges of incitement to riot. But what really moved the needle was Judge Edward Clarke’s closing comments. “What this trial has shown is that there is clearly evidence of racial hatred on both sides,” he told the courtroom. It was the first judicial acknowledgment of racism in the Met, three decades before the Macpherson inquiry. In McQueen’s hands, this is an electrifying story. Malachi Kirby (Darcus Howe) plays to the gallery at the Old Bailey, quoting Shakespeare and ridiculing the inconsistent police statements. We see Crichlow being manhandled by court officers and, in one of Mangrove’s most memorable scenes, beating the walls of his cell and shouting about the “savages” who hold him in it. The director and artist’s attention to detail is evident throughout, from a lingering shot of a colander spinning on the floor of the Mangrove kitchen after a raid, to a police officer’s fingernail burrowing into the witness box as his lies unravel. Mica Levi’s scratchy, bass-heavy score adds another layer of tension and paranoia. And in between the harassment and the court case, McQueen shows the West Indian community simply enjoying London life, from street parties to celebrations at the Mangrove. For McQueen, this project is personal. It’s the first of a five-film anthology series created for the BBC called Small Axe, which tells stories from London’s West Indian communities, from the late 60s to the mid-80s. As well as Mangrove, there’s Lovers Rock, which debuted to five-star reviews at the New York film festival, and is based on his auntie’s experiences at West Indian house parties in the 70s. Red, White And Blue stars John Boyega as pioneering black Met officer Leroy Logan, who joined the force in 1983 and became a superintendent at a time when London’s police were condemned as “institutionally racist”. Education focuses on the notorious so-called “schools for the educationally subnormal”, seen as a dumping ground for black children in the 70s, while Alex Wheatle tells the story of a man who grew up in the care system and went on to win the Guardian children’s fiction prize in 2016; Wheatle also worked on Small Axe. McQueen has had a hectic 12 months. As well as Small Axe, there has been a Tate Modern retrospective, plus his Year 3 project, in which he photographed 76,000 London primary school pupils for a show at Tate Britain. He has also made a series of public interventions on race and the creative industries. The last time I spoke to McQueen was in January, after the Baftas once again produced a list of nominations with no people of colour in any of the major acting categories. McQueen was the only one of several major British directors and actors approached by the Guardian who responded, and he didn’t hold back. “After a while you get a bit fed up with it,” he said. “Because if the Baftas are not supporting British talent, if you’re not supporting the people who are making headway in the industry, then I don’t understand what you are there for. If the Baftas wants to be like the Grammys, which is of no interest to anyone, and has no credibility at all, then they should continue on this path,” he added. “If not, then they have to change. Fact.” When McQueen talks about race, his delivery takes on a staccato quality. Sentences are often reduced to one or two words. He is abrupt, and jarringly honest. In June, McQueen wrote an opinion piece for the Observer about his efforts to make Small Axe in the UK with a diverse production team, saying he “could not believe the whiteness of the set” and, “If you want to examine race and class in this country, start by going on a film set.” He wanted the team behind the camera to be reflective of the stories he was telling. “We put a minority person in every single department, and we had four black heads of departments – I needed to have that,” he says now. Why was it so important to him? “How can I put my hands on the camera to start shooting if what’s behind the camera is not reflecting that?” he says matter-of-factly. “I did what I could do, but I didn’t think that was enough.” Small Axe isn’t completely unprecedented in the British film industry. Horace Ové became the first black British film-maker to direct a feature film in 1975, with Pressure, a story about a Trinidadian man in Ladbroke Grove who follows his older brother into the Black Power movement. Franco Rosso’s Babylon (1980) centred on a group of black Londoners in Brixton and Deptford penned in by the police and a racist society. David Koff’s documentary Blacks Britannica and John Akomfrah’s ode to Birmingham’s West Indian community, Handsworth Songs, both tackled similar subject matter. More recently, John Ridley’s Sky drama Guerrilla focused on London’s black 70s radicals – although it was heavily criticised for largely ignoring the black women of the movement. But there is a long gap between the black films of the late 70s and early 80s and today, an absence that looms large for McQueen. “We’ve had two generations of black British film-makers who have been erased,” he says. “Where are the editors? Where are the cinematographers? Where are the costume designers? Where are the designers? Where are the grips? Where are the gaffers?” What is his theory? “Why is the question,” he says, before answering: “People didn’t see the film industry or TV as attractive to them, because it hasn’t been made attractive for them. “But it’s not just behind the scenes; it’s in front of the camera, too. Our Marlon Brandos, our Montgomery Clifts are on building sites or driving buses,” he says. “Our Katharine Hepburns are in IT. They were not welcomed in the British film industry. It might be a bit crazy, but that’s my ambition: to fill that gap.” Despite his own impressive career, McQueen looks around him and sees potential that was never realised. He mentions his cousin Marcus, the subject of his artwork Nov 7th, in which Marcus tells the true story of how he fatally injured his brother while attempting to put the safety catch on a gun. He was not a trained actor, but McQueen says his cousin clearly had talent. “He could have been one of the greatest actors ever,” McQueen says. “I know that. That door wasn’t open to him. People say, ‘Well, he had a choice.’ You think people choose to do shit?” McQueen’s tone has shifted now; the staccato rhythm is coming back. “They don’t choose to go through doors where there’s trouble. If you had a choice, would you want to go for a door that has some kind of future, some kind of stability?” This sense of injustice is what drives McQueen’s work and his interventions. “Sorry,” he says. “I’m rambling on.” Malachi Kirby describes McQueen’s on-set presence as “intense… in a good way”; as a director, he made it clear to the cast that there wasn’t much point in showing up if they weren’t prepared to empty themselves. “Leave it on the pitch” was the footballing maxim McQueen used as shorthand for the fully committed performances he wanted. “There wasn’t any small talk,” Kirby adds. Scenes without dialogue that looked easy in the script would balloon into hours-long improvisations. One such scene, in which Howe delivers a sermon in a Trinidadian church, went from one line of narration to a full day of shooting (“We went from zero to 100, and got very sweaty in a very short space of time,” Kirby says). The scene didn’t even make the final cut. For McQueen, the Mangrove case is symbolic of what the West Indian community put up with, and fought against to cement their place in Britain. “You know the only reason I’m talking to you today is because of them,” he says, referring to the rarity of a black journalist interviewing a black director. “West Indians and what they did, by coming and paving the way for so many things to happen, for so many people, should be championed and celebrated.” The Mangrove Nine would go on to have varied lives. Howe became a broadcaster and columnist for the New Statesman, gaining more notoriety towards the end of his life when a BBC anchor suggested in a live interview that he was “not a stranger to riots”. Howe’s response went viral. “I have never taken part in a single riot, I have been on demonstrations that ended up in a conflict,” he said. “Have some respect for an old West Indian negro, and stop accusing me of being a rioter.” He died in 2017, after decades fighting for the rights of black Britons. Crichlow closed the Mangrove in 1992 after years of disputes with the authorities. The same year, he sued the Met for false imprisonment, battery and malicious prosecution. The police eventually paid him a record £50,000; he died in 2010, aged 78. Rothwell Kentish faced a separate prosecution after the Mangrove case, and was sentenced to 36 months for assault and possession of an offensive weapon. He died last year, aged 87. Rhodan Gordon turned Back-a-Yard into a Black People’s Information Centre, helping to defend housing tenants facing discrimination. He died in Grenada in 2018. Beese became a writer, while Jones-LeCointe, who came to London to complete a PhD in biochemistry, influenced a new generation of black activists, including Linton Kwesi Johnson who joined the cause after seeing her in a debate. Beese and Jones-LeCointe are the only surviving members of the Mangrove Nine; both have been invited to the film’s premiere at the London film festival on 7 October. The rest of the Small Axe films will go out at prime time on BBC One later this year. This is the first time a black historical drama with the heft of an Oscar-winner behind it has gone out in that slot, and McQueen knows it. “From day one, that was my priority. I wanted BBC One. I want my mum to see these pictures,” he says. “I want people to have access to it, and the BBC is the only way to do that. It is important because these are national stories. These are stories that helped to make the fabric of this country.” Is he worried about them becoming politicised, used as another stick with which to beat the BBC? After all, if the mere suggestion that a conductor supports Black Lives Matter can cause one of the biggest culture war moments of the year, what will a drama about black radicals who call the police “pigs” going out at prime time do? McQueen pauses and slowly repeats the phrase “culture war” before answering. “For me, it’s a moral situation. The thing about the Mangrove Nine is they were on the right side of history; so people have to decide what side of history they want to be on,” he says. “They were persecuted for the colour of their skin, they were persecuted because of their race. This is a celebration of justice. It is a celebration of self-determination, and it is a celebration of Britishness.” These five films are, in McQueen’s words, a “first port of call”. He wants to continue the series and go beyond the capital, to tell black British stories from Bristol, Manchester and Liverpool. “There are amazing stories that haven’t been told: national stories of the black community in those areas that I want to explore,” he says. “I’m interested in Liverpool because that was a place where the first, the largest black community was in the beginning. It’s about these amazing narratives of how black British people succeeded in other parts of the country.” The title of Small Axe comes from the Caribbean proverb, “If you are the big tree, we are the small axe”, made popular after Bob Marley used it as a lyric on the Wailers’ 1973 album Burnin’, followed by the line “ready to cut you down”. It’s a defiant statement in the face of terrible odds, and in Mangrove, McQueen has created his own redemption song. ",culture
"As the political fallout from the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg continued to roil Washington, Democrats “still held a shred of hope that they could persuade four moderate GOP senators to show some integrity and stick to their principles” in not voting on a nominee with just six weeks until a national election, said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. After all, Senate Republicans refused to vote on Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, with nine months to spare in 2016, citing the need for the people’s input in an election year. That hope “lasted almost a full day and a half,” reported Noah, as Utah senator Mitt Romney confirmed on Tuesday that he would “follow the constitution and precedent” and vote for Trump’s nominee “based upon their qualifications”. Many hoped otherwise, said Noah, as Romney is “the dad you ask when your other Republican dads say no,” but “people always forget that Mitt Romney is still a conservative senator from one of the most conservative states.” Securing a conservative majority on the supreme court is a longtime conservative dream, Noah explained, and joked that “on his bedroom wall growing up, Romney had a poster of Superman, a dancing horse, and an empty supreme court seat.” With the votes for a nominee a virtual lock and no avenues to prevent a confirmation, Democratic leadership vowed to seek revenge; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, told reporters Mitch McConnell should know that “he is playing with fire”. “But let’s be honest: knowing what we know about Democrats, ain’t shit going to happen,” said Noah. “When Democrats say ‘everything is on the table,’ then watch out, Republicans – you’re about to get a sternly worded email.” “There’s a Christmas in the air, leaves are changing, our nation is ravaged by a preventable disease due to our president’s criminal negligence,” said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show’s first episode of the fall season, on a day when America passed yet another grim pandemic milestone. Over 200,000 Americans have now died from the coronavirus, a toll higher than the battlefield deaths of its last five wars combined. And yet, the handling of the virus continues to be marked by confusion and political obfuscation. On Friday, the CDC updated its coronavirus information page with an addendum that “airborne particles can remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others, and travel distances beyond six feet”. “Kind of important information just to slip in there on a Friday afternoon,” Colbert deadpanned. “Hey, uh, you guys, no biggie, but the virus is airborne, six feet won’t save you, so you’re gonna want to wrap yourself in saran wrap and start a new life under the floor boards.” But on Tuesday, the CDC quietly removed the information, claiming it was just a “draft version” that was “posted in error.” “Well, that’s not comforting,” said Colbert. “That’s like a fire marshal saying, ‘if you catch fire, remember: just stop, drop, and ignore everything I just said.’” The CDC claimed the extra-airborne guidance was an “honest mistake,” but “I think we should take everything the CDC says with a grain of salt for the foreseeable future,” said Colbert, since Trump appointees delayed one CDC study for weeks because it showed the actual number of coronavirus infections was ten times the official number, and thus in “conflict” with Trump messaging. “So they’re trying to change reality just to fit what the president says,” Colbert added, “which explains why the CDC says the new recommended serving size for food is bucket.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel returned to the studio after a summer off from late-night to recap the bitterly contested rush by Republicans to place a conservative on the supreme court, despite blocking Democrats’ efforts to do so in 2016. Trump is “moving very quickly on this,” said Kimmel, “but when it came to doing something about the virus that he knew was deadly – a virus that has now killed over 200,000 of the Americans he swore an oath to protect – then he moves slower than Eric doing the People magazine crossword puzzle.” On Monday, Trump told a crowd in Ohio that the coronavirus effects “virtually nobody” – which is “insane,” said Kimmel, as is the inexplicable CDC revision of its own guidelines on airborne virus particles. To recap: on Friday, the CDC posted a warning on its website that droplets could remain suspended in air and travel more than six feet, “which was a big deal,” said Kimmel, “because even though we knew this, this was the first time a government website admitted it.” But on Tuesday, the droplets paragraph was replaced with a correction that claimed a “draft version” was “posted in error” to the website. “In other words: oops, we accidentally posted the truth, sorry,” Kimmel explained.",culture
"With a specially baked cake from Mary Berry and a blue plaque in her honour on her favourite work chair, Dame Jenni Murray acknowledged that it felt “very, very strange” to be hosting her final edition of Woman’s Hour after 33 years.  Murray, the BBC Radio 4 show’s longest serving host, took up her post in September 1987 and ended her tenure on Thursday, played out by Helen Reddy’s anthem I Am Woman. Ending her broadcast, Murray said she had to consistently remind herself that women are a “vast range” and there are “many, many, many different stereotypes that fit our gender, so there is no one stereotypical woman. But our sex, we share.” She was joined live on the show by Labour politician Harriet Harman, barrister Helena Kennedy, theatre director Jude Kelly and writer Jackie Kay, all of whom paid warm tribute. Harman said they were all from the first generation of women to say they were not going to choose between staying at home or prioritising going out to work, but would do both. “That was an incredible, huge social and economic revolution which was invisible to most of the broadcasting world,” said Harman. “But Woman’s Hour, with you right at the heart of it, you made the space for all of these issues to be discussed day in, day out.” Without that space, the progress that has been made would never have come about, Harman said. “You leave a tremendous legacy and I want to really thank you for that.” Kay said she saluted Murray for “holding a mirror up to the real world and everything that’s been going on in that … and to the imaginative world and the cultural world.” Kelly said Murray was not just a “national treasure”, but an international one – the programme has fans as far afield as Japan. Lady Kennedy pointed to the issue of marital rape, which Murray and Woman’s Hour shone light on. “By giving public space for a debate … it actually ignited the shift that took place. By putting it on air, organisations like the Women’s Institute then invited me to go and speak … Women started making the demand for change. I think it was about being well informed.” Murray told her guests that she preferred a solid chair to one that wiggles around. “It’s green and it’s been here for years. The studio managers have put a blue plaque on it: ‘Jenni Murray last sat on this chair on 1 October 2020’.” The programme included a collection of her best moments over 33 years, revealing how Murray never shied from tricky questions. There were snippets of her interviews with Hillary Clinton (“What is it about Bill that has enabled you to forgive his infidelities?”) and Edwina Currie (“How supportive to women can you call yourself when you have put Norma Major’s private life into the public sphere?”). Within weeks of joining the programme, Murray interviewed Bette Davis, then in her 80s. The actor had a fearsome reputation, but Murray won her over, even managing to persuade her to deliver her line from All About Eve: “Fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a bumpy night.” One of her most regularly terrifying interviewees was Margaret Thatcher, she said. Not so terrified that Murray did not bring up how François Mitterand waxed lyrical about Thatcher’s Marilyn Monroe lips and Alan Clark was attracted to her ankles. “Did you play on that? Did you flirt if you had to?” Murray asked. “I didn’t even know they had made these comments,” Thatcher replied, looking aghast. “How should I?” Murray said she was baffled by the reply, but later realised that Thatcher’s press secretary, Bernard Ingham, would never have dreamed of ever telling her these things had been said. The “peak of her career” was telling Joan Baez that her favourite song was Diamonds and Rust, and being delighted as Baez performed it there and then. It left her “sobbing inside because she was so wonderful”, she said.  Barnsley-born Murray joined the BBC in 1973, working first for BBC Radio Bristol. After spells on BBC South Today, Newsnight and the Today programme, she became a regular presenter of Woman’s Hour in 1987. Her colleague Jane Garvey has also announced that she is stepping down from presenting duties, in her case after 13 years. Radio 5 Live’s Emma Barnett will take over in the new year.",culture
"If you’re craving a zombie series that ditches the cynicism and has some good old-fashioned fun with the idea, then allow me to introduce you to Zomboat!, a short, six-episode British comedy with a silly title but a surprisingly clever premise. The series follows sisters Kat and Jo (Leah Brotherhead and Crazyhead’s Cara Theobold) after they wake up one Sunday to find Birmingham under attack by zombies. As a gamer nerd who knows her zombie lore, Kat already has a plan for this scenario – steal a canal boat and escape to Eel Pie Island in London, because zombies can’t swim. And, as Kat puts it, “The Walking Dead would have been over in one season if Rick Grimes had gone to the Everglades.” After stealing said canal boat, the sisters find two stowaways in the bathroom: misanthropic Sunny (Hamza Jeetooa) and his sensitive gym bro buddy Amar (Ryan McKen), who are stranded in the city after a stag weekend. Though they clash at first, the group decides to team up for survival, leading to plenty of bickering, bonding and snogs. As a result, the series avoids falling into the same style-over-substance trap that spoiled other recent zombie comedies (like Netflix’s Daybreak); instead, it benefits from the kind of found-family warmth that made Zombieland so charming. That’s not to say there isn’t action. If you think fleeing zombies on a tiny, slow-moving canal boat might create some unusual challenges, you would be right. For a start, there are 166 canal locks between Birmingham and London, the water can drain without warning and the toilet on the boat doesn’t cope well with poo. Zomboat! doesn’t keep its characters confined to the boat for long, allowing each episode to introduce a seemingly trivial problem that forces everyone back on land. Comparisons with fellow British zom-com Shaun of the Dead are fair: Zomboat! creators Adam Miller and Will Hartley were heavily inspired by the film’s meta brand of humour. But while the set-up of their show isn’t exactly original, it’s fun to watch this ragtag group quip their way through classic zombie movie scenarios – such as a poorly guarded government evacuation centre – because the stakes aren’t particularly high and their behaviour is unpredictable enough to keep you guessing. They also never feel like genre stereotypes, just real people reacting absurdly to an absurd situation (which is all too believable these days). It would be easy to let Kat, as the most self-aware character, do nothing more than poke fun at zombie tropes, but Zomboat! subverts that cliché by making reality fall short of her expectations. At first the solitary nerd relishes her chance to lead the group through a real apocalypse with her knowledge from movies and games, but it turns out leather pants chafe and zombie blood will ruin a perfectly good cup of tea. In one especially entertaining episode, Jo is left covered in zombie goo and spends the whole runtime trying to find a hot shower, which is frankly the most relatable behaviour I’ve ever seen in a zombie story. If lockdown has taught us anything, it’s that we’re desperate to hold onto our little comforts in the face of chaos. Zomboat! might deal with the end of the world, but it’s a wacky, fantasy version of the apocalypse that I for one have sorely missed, especially now that The Walking Dead’s nihilistic approach has become expected in the genre. As harmless escapism goes, it’s the perfect three-hour binge.",culture
"Bridget Christie: I could watch her for hours. She’s one of the reasons I became a comedian in the first place. As a proud Yorkshire lass, I’ve got to say the Four Yorkshiremen from At Last the 1948 Show.  Billy Connolly’s Tall Tales and Wee Stories, a collection of his most famous routines written down. He truly is the master. Victoria Wood’s Dinnerladies is just exceptionally written; every single line is a setup or a punchline.  My nana, Lavinia Forrest: she’s funny because she doesn’t know she’s funny. My grandad will hate this answer because he likes to think he’s the funny one in the family. As a disabled comedian, often my hecklers are also disabled. Once I was heckled for an entire hour by a seemingly lovely woman with a speech box … so she had to type her heckle out before playing it. That’s effort, and I respect her for that. I pride myself on being excellent at fancy dress, and I have dressed up as Ronald McDonald, Lady Gaga, a Christmas pudding and a crocodile to name but a few. But I think my funniest outfit was a fully inflatable Mr Blobby costume. Have you ever seen a five-foot lady with cerebral palsy wobbling towards you dressed as Mr Blobby? It was quite something. My walk. Let’s clarify this: you’re not allowed to laugh at my walk but I am. Most times I am in control of my leggies, but occasionally they have a mind of their own, and the little flicks can be very funny. “Utch”. It’s a northern word that means: “Move your big bum, I want to sit on the sofa.” I remember moving to London and friends being baffled when I’d wave at them, shouting: “Oi, utch up love!” Makes me proud to be a northern bird.

"As news broke last week that Universal Studios Group will soon shoot three major TV series in Queensland, adding to a slate of international productions promising to bring jobs to a besieged local industry, many urged caution. “The majority of employment in the Australian sector is not on Hollywood blockbusters made for international audiences but on Australian film and television telling Australian stories to Australian audiences,” the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance says.  Still, those Hollywood blockbusters are hammering at our door. “Of course they all want to work here!” actor and director Rachel Griffiths says. “We look like a miracle.” At the suggestion that the pandemic might yet have a silver lining for the local screen industry, Claire Tonkin, head of drama at Australian film and television production company, CJZ, says: “Well, it’s been a heck of a cloud!” In April, grim estimates from the Guardian projected 20,000 job losses in the Australian screen industry. Screen production ground to a shuddering halt around the world. But as many Australian states started to gain local control of the virus, and with some having been effectively Covid-free for months, international producers have turned to Australia as they scramble to find safe havens to make new product. They are the gatekeepers of a colossal global market for film and TV production. According to figures from creative industries strategy consultancy, Olsberg/SPI, global spending on screen production reached $250bn in 2019, with 14m jobs created. The federal government’s $400m location incentive boost announced in July specifically targeted international productions with the aim of attracting some of this swag. And it appears to be working. “It’s been phenomenal,” says Kate Marks, CEO of Ausfilm. “Since April, when it became clear we were getting on top of the virus, and after the Location Incentive was announced, we’ve had $2.7bn in inquiries from international productions.” Screen agencies across the country, from Western Australia to northern New South Wales, are also reporting record requests from around the world. Although it’s impossible to gauge how many of those queries will bear fruit, a tally of the 11 major international film and television productions either in production, or slated to start shooting soon, paints a healthy outlook for the local industry. Combined estimates show an injection of just over $1bn into the sector, with almost 18,500 jobs generated by projects including Marvel’s Thor: Love and Thunder and Paramount’s Shantaram. Those figures seem likely to grow, with major projects involving actor Liam Neeson and director Ron Howard rumoured to be on the way. But the good news comes with a caveat. Producer and founder of production company CJZ, Nick Murray, called out the shortcomings of the location incentive system in an opinion piece published in the Sydney Morning Herald: “The new scheme stuffs cash into the pockets of the studios on the false premise that helping the foreign productions is of benefit to the local sector. It isn’t.” If the Location Incentive is a carrot to attract international investment, quotas that force free-to-air and subscription television to produce Australian content are the stick that protects Australia’s unique screen culture, though streaming services have so far been exempt, and the question of whether this ought to continue has been hotly debated. Those quotas were suspended in April after Covid-19 halted Australian screen production. On Tuesday, the government announced their reinstatement from 1 January but with changes that have left the industry fuming, including dropping the quota on children’s television for free-to-air TV and continuing to leave the streamers exempt. Screen Producers Australia CEO Matthew Deane, described the announcement as a “backward step” that threatens to halve the amount of local content being made, and wipe out thousands of jobs. According to the MEAA, film and television content under Australian creative control is worth about $5.3bn a year, and generates 30,000 jobs, dwarfing the international contribution to the local industry. To defend local content, the Australian screen industry has presented a united front since 2017 through the Make It Australian campaign, stating: “Our ability to keep telling Australian stories on screen is at risk, and our voices in danger of being drowned out by a deluge of overseas content.” They point to the European Union quota system, where at least 30% of content carried by streaming platforms must come from the region. Murray wants the same rules to apply in Australia. Some industry players see prospects for all parties to productively coexist. Tony Ayres, an award-winning Australian director, showrunner and writer who co-founded Matchbox Pictures and launched his own production company in 2018, is a staunch advocate for Australian voices. “A country’s national identity is defined, in part, by the stories that we tell about ourselves,” Ayres says. But he doesn’t see the need for friction between local and international productions, calling it “a symbiotic relationship” where “each feeds off the other”. In the meantime, others are just happy to see jobs on the horizon. Griffiths envisions a promising way forward. “One key element is finding ways to collaborate on an international level to support our fantastic local storytellers to keep telling stories that have meaning for us.”",culture
"Tuesday night’s presidential debate was, by most accounts, an off-the-rails train wreck, one quickly trashed by late-night hosts. “Usually when you see two guys this age arguing, it’s about leaves being blown on to each other’s lawns,” said Jimmy Fallon of the 90-minute spectacle which pitted Donald Trump against Joe Biden, both in their 70s, for what turned into an incoherent, sinister mess. The president interrupted Biden to the point of incoherence and talked over the moderator, Fox News’s Chris Wallace. There were few coherent sentences to process, and even less substance. “Seriously, did anyone take anything away from tonight?” the Tonight Show host wondered. “Was that helpful to any American? The only person who enjoyed that was Vladimir Putin while he was stroking a cat. “Honestly, sitting through that debate felt like getting a Covid test in both nostrils at once,” Fallon added. The spectacle in Cleveland, Ohio, did, Fallon joked, make history in that it “was the first time Americans ever watched something on TV and wished there were commercials”. Fallon also panned Wallace’s performance as moderator, in which he failed to cut Trump off, enforce rules or maintain control. “Before the debate, Chris Wallace said if he did his job right, it would be like he’s not there. Well, mission accomplished,” Fallon joked, comparing Wallace’s performance to watching “a kindergarten teacher running a class on Zoom”. “First things first, we need new debate rules, people,” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. “Chris Wallace, thank you for your service, and I hope that you have a lot of money for your therapy, you made a valiant effort, but you were not ready for this. Because no human being could’ve been ready for this. They don’t need a moderator for this thing, they need a UFC ref. “Moderators, you need to figure out how to handle Trump at a debate, because this is not good for the nation,” he added. Noah jokingly proposed more effective strategies to keep Trump from interrupting, such as using a spray bottle on his hair or offering him $100 for every sentence he lets Biden finish, since “money is a great incentive for him, and now that we’ve seen the tax returns, we know that he needs it”. “Whoever decided on this format needs to be fired,” Noah added. “I have never, and I mean never, wanted to see a commercial break more badly in my life.” Why, Noah asked in disbelief, were there no factcheckers? “Otherwise people can just stand on the stage and say whatever they want, and there are no consequences. Zero, nada, zilch. Every time a candidate says a lie, there should be some kind of sign that they lied. “It’s like the NBA Finals and all of a sudden you can call your own fouls. No! That’s chaos – you need an actual ref on the court, people.” So what was his takeaway from the debate? Noah shrugged. What was there to say? “I don’t know how Biden did, because Trump did more interrupting than Kanye West in a room full of Taylor Swifts,” he said. “It sounded less like a debate and more like the radio was stuck catching two stations.” “I come to you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, an empty vessel,” said Stephen Colbert following the debate, for which he found the term “shitshow” to be an inadequate descriptor – “both an insult to shows and to the other word that I can’t say because this is CBS”. The Late Show host zoomed in on “one of the most telling, one of the most upsetting moments not only of the night but of my lifetime”, which was “when the president of the United States was asked simply to condemn white supremacy”. Trump instead sputtered: “I’m willing to do anything, I want to see peace,” and “Give me a name, who do you want me to name?” When Wallace answered “white supremacists” as Biden supplied the Proud Boys, a men-only, far-right extremist group, Trump responded: “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.” “Didn’t do it!” Colbert fumed, then imitated the president: “I don’t support white supremacists, I just command them, like a dog, that’s why I’ve got this shiny dogwhistle.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel lamented a “terrible” first debate. “I’d call it a nightmare,” he said, “but at least during a nightmare you get some sleep. “Because of the pandemic, there’s no opening handshake tonight; there’s no physical contact,” Kimmel explained of the Covid-era’s strange set-up. “The candidates remained socially distant the whole time. It was like date night with Melania.” That was about the only restraint shown by the president; “they flipped a coin to determine who would get the first question, but when Trump saw the quarter in the air he said, ‘Hey, that’s how much I paid in taxes last year,’ and it went downhill from there,” Kimmel joked. The “debate” veered so far into chaos, largely thanks to Trump’s ceaseless interruption, that Wallace had to repeatedly call attention to the task at hand. That’s how you know it’s bad, Kimmel concluded. “You know things are getting heated when the moderator pleads, ‘Please, gentlemen, let’s return to the topic of race.’”",culture

"A debate about the lack of diversity in Australian musical theatre has resulted in the cancellation of a $50,000 scholarship amid disputed allegations of bullying and intimidation. The 2020 Rob Guest Endowment, a lucrative professional development program for musical theatre, was cancelled late last week, with organisers saying they were concerned for the “mental health and welfare” of the prize’s 30 semifinalists, alleging that the latter had experienced “bullying and intimidation” as a consequence of a recent outcry about their apparent lack of diversity. But the semifinalists have roundly rejected claims that they are the victims of bullying, instead saying that after weeks of negotiation with prize organisers, they had been planning to withdraw from the competition en masse, before the endowment beat them to the punch by announcing its cancellation. The dispute follows weeks of tense discussions about diversity and inclusion between the endowment leadership committee, the semifinalists and the performers’ union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA). Complaints erupted in August around the prize’s semifinalist announcement, with many observers noting the chosen 30 performers appeared to be uniformly white. In response to the backlash, the endowment organisers said they “clearly [needed] to work harder at encouraging entrants from the BIPOC [black, Indigenous and people of colour] community”. At the time, the 30 semifinalists said they stood in solidarity with artists and performers who were people of colour. “We are uniting to listen, learn and actively be part of the solution,” they said in a joint statement. The endowment released a statement last Wednesday in which the leadership committee apologised for its “omissions and failures” in the 2020 competition, saying it had sought guidance from “industry leaders” to ensure the program was “inclusive, safe and welcoming”. The statement listed a number of strategies the endowment was proposing to implement, including diversity quotas for its leadership board, judging panels and finalist selections, as well as allowing prize entrants to self-identify by ethnicity. “It became clear that given the progress so far, the best path forward would be to continue to work with and support the current semi-finalists, while working to bring significant and exciting change to future years,” the statement said. Two days later, the organisers cancelled the 2020 prize entirely. The endowment said on Friday afternoon it was calling off the competition and suspending its scholarship grant until 2022 “to protect” the semifinalists, saying the latter had been “targeted and intimidated from a number of sources and as a result have experienced significant anxiety over recent weeks”. The finalists, however, rejected the endowment’s claim that they were bullied. “We categorically refute any claim or insinuation made by the endowment, or any others, that the competition had to be cancelled in order to protect us from bullying and/or intimidation,” they said in a joint statement on Sunday, released through the MEAA. The semifinalists said they had, from the outset, sought assistance from the diversity committee of the MEAA’s Equity branch, the arm of the union that represents performers. Following those discussions “and through our own volition”, the semifinalists said, they had decided to withdraw from the competition en masse, “to prevent our colleagues from further trauma, to de-centre ourselves and to amplify the First Nations and POC voices”. “The endowment’s reactive cancellation prevented us from enacting this step,” they said. “We fervently denounce the actions of the endowment, including but not limited to silencing POC and First Nations voices, misrepresenting us and our stance on the matter, and the lack of transparency that has occurred from within the endowment.” The endowment had been involved in negotiations with the semifinalists, the Equity diversity committee and other members of the performing arts community since 20 August, the union said in a separate statement on Sunday.  A log of claims, which the union said had been created from “discussion with over 100 vested stakeholders” and which detailed changes the industry had hoped to see in the prize, had been presented to the endowment on 2 September. Further claims had been put to the endowment last week, after its proposed actions fell short of what the performers’ coalition had hoped for. “It is disappointing that the time, lived experiences, and wealth of knowledge and skills that were volunteered by the [equity diversity committee], our members and our wider industry has been mislabeled as ‘bullying’ and ‘intimidation’,” the union said. “It’s concerning to see the endowment rob the semi-finalists of the commendable agency we’ve witnessed over the past month, to silence their voices and co-opt them in a narrative they were not part, let alone aware of. This work should not be discounted or invalidated, but engaged with.” The Rob Guest Endowment declined to comment.",culture
" As labours of love go, the French label Naïve’s Vivaldi edition, begun in 2000 and now notching up some 60 titles, takes some beating. The opera Il Tamerlano, performed by the Accademia Bizantina and directed by Ottavio Dantone, is the latest in the series, starring the baritone Bruno Taddia as Bajazet (by which name the 1735 tragedy is also known), countertenor Filippo Mineccia as Tamerlano and contralto Delphine Galou as Asteria. Mezzo-soprano Sophie Rennert (Irene) has the work’s best-known number, Sposa son disprezzata, in which she bemoans her fate as a spurned bride. Taddia puts high energy into his agitated Dov’è la figlia (Where is my daughter?), the strings of the Accademia Bizantina lithe and spirited in their busy accompaniment. Vivaldi wrote some of the arias, borrowing from elsewhere for others in the habit of the day. Performance standards are high, and even when interest dips a bit the three acts rattle along in high style.  Kicking off with a bang and full of bawdy humour, Malcolm Arnold’s The Dancing Master, Op 34 (Resonus), performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra and soloists in this world-premiere recording, conducted by John Andrews, has been neglected like so much of the composer’s music. This 1952 farce, commissioned by the BBC but rejected for being too racy, is full of double entendres and mistaken identity, as befits a piece inspired by a Restoration comedy: nothing to frighten today’s audiences, and full of melody and the vivid orchestration that made Arnold, among other things, such a skilful composer for cinema. A lively cast – Eleanor Dennis, Catherine Carby, Fiona Kimm, Ed Lyon, Mark Wilde, Graeme Broadbent – enunciate every word crisply. Andrews keeps the pace brisk, capturing the wit and making a persuasive case for this 75-minute work. Arnold has his advocate: his star may be rising.

"Making this list made me realise there have been way too many funny things I’ve received from the internet. It was really difficult to choose just 10 from the multitude that came to mind. Perhaps this realisation should have sent me into a spiral about how much time I spend online, but really, that kind of crisis is just so 2019. Anyway I hope these make you laugh. And if they don’t, it’s okay. We’re all different people with hugely varying, equally valid world views and that’s what makes the world such a beautiful, dynamic, super divided, polarised and ill-equipped to fight climate change place! It’s really hard to choose a favourite Clickhole article but Give Me Kiss is not just one of the funniest pieces of writing online, but I think one of the funniest things I’ve read ever? It’s hard and unimportant to say what Give Me Kiss is exactly. It’s probably best to call it a love letter that begins, “Hello, spouse. This is your spouse. I have a special message for you on this, our ninth anniversary. The special message is this: Give me kiss.” And it just ... escalates from there. Like Shakespeare, Give Me Kiss does things to the English language that haven’t been done before. Except it’s much funnier than Shakespeare. Honestly, people should abandon his sonnets and read Give Me Kiss at their weddings. A singer with an impressive vocal range covers pop songs as Toad from Mario – this is everything that’s good about the internet. While every Toad Sings cover is a hilarious screech into the void, Chandelier is the first one I heard, and still has me laughing. I’ve also been singing along lately – and it’s a big cathartic 2020 mood. There’s nothing I can say about Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared except that it’s mind-bending, hilarious and perfect. If you need more information, Wiki says it’s a “surreal comedy web-series” that parodies “children’s TV” and includes “psychedelic content and imagery involving gore and psychological horror”. What a dream!! (I just read the team behind Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared have been developing a TV show for years that’s getting a release soon. We are saved!) The Lord of the Rings (LoTR) universe feels like a crucial part of early online comedy culture – maybe because it’s uniquely ripe for jokes, or maybe because the films came out when a generation of kids were getting ready to hook their brains to the internet forever. Whatever the reason, it’s still going strong and you have to respect that (also I was that kid who put their name into an Elvish name generator so just let me have this okay). Of the many memes, Alright Then, Keep Your Secrets is one of my favourites: endlessly versatile, sometimes political, always instinctually ridiculous – I mean, just look at Frodo’s shit-eating smile. Special mentions go out to other legendary LoTR comedy bits online like Ian McKellen’s Gandalf scene on Extras and Cassie Claire’s very silly LoTR fanfic diaries. Oh what was my Elvish name you (absolutely didn’t) ask? I couldn’t say. I must... keep my secret. If you’ve never read Kate Beaton’s comic series Hark! A Vagrant, you now have the next week of your life sorted. Often history based, always super smart and silly, Beaton’s illustrations are genius and have made me cry-laugh many times. Straw Feminists is one of the greats. The internet loves the trashy camp of reality TV. While there are endless memes from The Real Housewives franchise, including the legendary woman yelling at cat, to choose from, “Pooja, what is this behaviour?” has my heart forever. “Pooja, what is this behaviour?” started as a clip from Bigg Boss (the Indian version of Big Brother). From the coincidental jazz caused by Pooja kicking a bin, to her brazen defiance – “I kicked it by mistake” – to Pooja’s inspired choice to switch accents (what is that accent? Cockney? High vamp? Pooja™?) while yelling, “You’re asking for it! You’re dying for it!” at someone who’s clearly doing nothing of the sort – every beat is a masterpiece. The video first gained traction among parts of the South Asian internet, but now it’s everywhere, in endless gifs, TikToks, and as shorthand for when you just need to ask, what is this behaviour? Chris Fleming is a kind of fae goblin whose videos have a particularly online quality. Often featuring a lo-fi score, and uh, “interesting” body language, his sketches somehow distil cultural neuroses into horribly funny and hysterical truth, which is my favourite type of truth. This is the first Early/Berlant video I saw and it caused me to die on the spot. When I got to hell, I wouldn’t stop talking about the video so they returned me to earth. Yes it’s another Chris (just as strange), and another comics artist, but Chris (Simpsons artist) deserves his own entry. Chris’s images feel like non-sequiturs written by a disturbed child that nevertheless make a desperate funny sense. They’re viscerally weird, a bit gross and liable to haunt your days. Enjoy.

"Hundreds of civic museums in towns and cities across England are in a state of high jeopardy and some may never reopen without government action, museum leaders have said. They say organisations face an existential threat at a time when they could be playing a pivotal role in “reawakening and reimagining” town and city centres. Consultations on large-scale redundancies have already been announced by museum trusts in Birmingham and York. Local authorities, often the main funder of civic museums, have said their finances are in a potentially perilous state, with at least five English councils suggesting they may not be able to balance their budgets. In a joint statement, the English Civic Museums Network, the Museums Association and the National Museum Directors’ Council call on the government to extend the cultural recovery fund into 2021-22 and to provide funding settlements for councils that enable them to invest in museums. Tony Butler, the director of Derby Museums Trust, said museums were most worried about the next financial year. “Talk to any local government funding chief and they will say there are big problems ahead.” He said museums and galleries knew from bitter experience of government austerity policies that they are among the first to suffer when cuts have to be made. In early July Derby was one of the first city museums to reopen after lockdown. “We saw our role as being in the vanguard of reactivating the city centre,” said Butler. “In the future, there will be a further decline in retail in town and city centres and in its place leisure and culture will play a much bigger role in attracting people. Once we’re through this, there is a huge potential for museums to play their part in regeneration.” Derby Museum and Art Gallery has the world’s finest and largest collection of works by Joseph Wright of Derby, paintings that can currently be enjoyed in relative quiet. “There are some real treasures in our museum and they help us understand our place in the world when life is in such flux,” said Butler. Civic museums are predicting an average 81% drop in commercial profits and 66% fall in donations this year. Sharon Heal, the director of the Museums Association, said she was “deeply concerned” that some museums will not be able to reopen after lockdown. “We are already hearing of major local authorities that are considering not funding their museums and galleries because they are non-statutory services,” she said. “Museums are vital civic spaces and can play a critical role in rebuilding and recovery with their communities – but they need funding to be able to do that.” Ian Blatchford, the director of the Science Museum Group and chair of the National Museums Directors’ Council, said: “Civic museums have already weathered brutal cuts to their services over the last 10 years, adapting their business models to find alternative sources of funding, but the current crisis means they are being pushed to the limit. “This government has already committed to supporting our towns and regions, so investing in museums, a core part of our civic infrastructure, is a key way of ensuring that people everywhere can benefit.” Museum funding is becoming an increasingly political issue. Over the weekend it emerged that the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, had written to the directors of all government-funded museums and galleries warning them not to remove statues or other artefacts as a result of pressure from campaigners. In the letter, leaked to the Sunday Telegraph, he said it was imperative that publicly funded bodies acted impartially, particularly as the Treasury embarked on a “challenging” review of all Whitehall spending.",culture
"A teenager rides her placid black horse through the countryside, dropping off bundles of books to the town’s children. It’s a wholesome scene reminiscent of a 19th century novel, except it’s 2020 and this book delivery service is helping a small bookstore stay in business during a pandemic. Squishy Minnie is a much-loved children’s bookstore located in the Macedon Ranges town of Kyneton, Victoria. Using horsepower to deliver books was just one way the bookstore’s owners, local couple Kristen Proud and Lakshal “Lucky” Perera, kept the community entertained when it had to close its doors. The store closed sooner than most: Proud, who has a masters in international health, watched the virus escalate around the world and concluded that the federal government wasn’t acting fast enough. She closed the bookshop in mid-March before lockdown restrictions were introduced. “I was in the shop watching kids touch everything and I could feel my anxiety rising. Our space encourages touching and interaction. I thought to myself ‘if any one of these people has Covid, we’re screwed’,” says Proud. But with that decision came a different kind of apprehension. Proud and Perera knew their bookshop was important to the families in the area, and they were concerned about the knock-on effects that closing might have. “We didn’t want to lose our connection to the community because we had to close our doors,” says Proud. So they set about a different way of operating. The junior staff had lost their storefront shifts, so Proud came up with creative ways to keep them busy. Fifteen-year-old Sam delivered books on his pushbike, while 17-year-old Alice saddled up to complete book deliveries with her beloved horse, Argo. “Kids loved it. People put in orders just so they could get a horseback delivery. It really brought joy to the community during a challenging time,” says Proud. The store’s strong social media following resulted in online orders coming in from all over Australia, with staff adding further personal touches to deliveries by including handwritten notes and complimentary nasturtium seeds for home gardens. When panic buying emptied supermarket shelves, a free roll of toilet paper was added to postal orders upon request, thanks to Proud fortuitously ordering a year’s supply before the pandemic. This sense of community spirit had also led Proud and Perera to set up the town’s first street library for children’s books earlier in the year, built in collaboration with the Kyneton Men’s Shed. Its book clubs moved online. A grant from the local community house also enabled them to host additional online writing and illustration workshops for kids. But no event was as important to maintain for Squishy Minnie as story time, a weekly institution looked forward to by adults and children alike. Before Covid-19, the store would heave with excited, fidgety little bodies all bursting to see resident storyteller and music-maker Perera in action. Once closed, storytime was swiftly moved online, with special guests injecting some variety into the lives of families locked down during a long, cold (seemingly never-ending) Victorian winter. A dog-themed story time recently featured the couple’s cute-as-a-button groodle, Helix, while Logie award-winning actor and writer Miranda Tapsell and Kyneton-based screenwriter Joshua Tyler celebrated the release of their co-written illustrated book Aunty’s Wedding with a special reading on Zoom. “We opened Squishy Minnie because we wanted regional kids and young adults to have access to exceptional books and resources. We focus on books that reflect the society we live in, such as literature written by First Nations authors and books that have characters from a variety of cultural backgrounds,” says Proud, who adds that story-time sessions have also been held in Spanish and Auslan. The store recently hosted Boonwurrung elder Aunty Fay Muir and co-author Sue Lawson in an online reading of their new book Respect, produced by Indigenous-owned and led publishing house, Magabala Books. But it’s Perera who has become something of a local star in the community as a result of his regular story-time duties. “I absolutely love doing story time. It’s one of the highlights of my week. The happiness and excitement on the faces of the little folks each time I see them is joyous,” he says. As a Sri Lankan Australian living in a region that’s home to a predominantly white population, Perera believes his presence helps to encourage inclusivity. “There is a real benefit for me doing story time and being a visible presence at Squishy Minnie. It’s helping to advance tolerance and understanding in our region’s young folks,” he says. “I jokingly tell everyone that I’m a celebrity in the under-four demographic. It’s rare for me to be able to go out without a little person waving, smiling or saying hello to me.” The store celebrated Love Your Bookshop Day on 3 October with an online story-time extravaganza over Zoom starring 13 authors including Briony Stewart, Zeno Sworder and Maree McCarthy Yoelu. With restrictions recently easing in regional Victoria, Squishy Minnie has tentatively reopened to a limited number of masked, sanitised book browsers. Despite the challenges of running an independent bookstore in a regional area during lockdown, Proud has seen many positives spring from what has been a diabolical year. “The community has really rallied to show us support,” she says. “People have actively chosen to buy from us and send us uplifting messages on social media. Covid-19 has emphasised that the community is invested in our survival. I wouldn’t have necessarily known that otherwise. It’s pretty amazing.”",culture
"Actor Patsy Ferran was born in Valencia in 1989 and studied drama and theatre arts at Birmingham University before going to Rada. She graduated in 2014 and made her West End debut in that same year playing Edith, in Blithe Spirit and Jim in Treasure Island at the National Theatre. She recently played Honey in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? on Broadway, and has also appeared in various TV shows and films including God’s Own Country. Last year she won best actress at the Olivier and the Critics’ Circle theatre awards. She was in A Christmas Carol at the Bridge theatre until it was forced to close last week. Ferran plays Sister Blanche in Black Narcissus, which begins on BBC One on 27 December.  Weather by Jenny Offill Lockdown was an interesting experience because it reignited my love of reading in full force. This is one that still sticks in the brain. Loads of local bookshops were celebrating it. It’s the kind of book that has its own table. It follows this woman who is a librarian, and due to her occupation, she is very much an observer of life. The main theme is the state of the planet, dealing with climate change, living in a divisive world, potentially exhausting subjects, but she does it with a sense of humour. I tend to annotate parts of books that I like, and my copy is full of sticky tabs. Scrooge (Brian Desmond Hurst, 1951) I watched it out of duty, as prep for this job I’m doing at the moment. I was so pleasantly moved and surprised. It’s just gorgeous. It’s so well shot and so well told. The actor who plays Scrooge, Alastair Sim, is wonderful in it. I felt like a kid again watching it. I prejudged, and thought it was going to feel dated, but it works and his performance is joyous and so good. My boyfriend was away on another job, and I kept filming scenes on my laptop and sending them to him. It made me want to look into other films from that era I might have overlooked. The Terrell Show YouTube is my weakness. I absolutely adore Terrell Grice. He hosts a show in his house and has a signature blue wall which he and his guests talk in front of. He loves music, soul, R&B, gospel. He invites a singer on, nine times out of 10 with an extraordinary voice, and they play a game called song association. He gives them a word, and they have to sing a song with the word in. The two episodes I love are with Cynthia Erivo and Stout. Grice is so gorgeous and charming. You just have to watch him react. Lots of positivity and talent. Backlisted It’s hosted by two lovely men called John Mitchinson and Andy Miller. They are both ex-booksellers. One of them is now an author and the other is the publisher of Unbound. They invite a mate on who has a favourite book that has either been overlooked in the past, or is from a famous author but less known. I heard about it during the first lockdown and it saved my soul a little bit. With all of this uncertainty, there can be a lot of negativity. It was such a change. I found it alien to hear three or four people generously talk about something. They trained their brains into reading something that might not be their cup of tea, but always find something good to say about it Selling Sunset (Netflix) British TV is very wholesome, like The Great British Bake Off or Strictly Come Dancing, but that doesn’t do it for me. I need American and shiny, and Selling Sunset ticked all the boxes. It’s about estate agents in Hollywood selling the gazillion-dollar mansions to rich people. They wear the most ridiculously high heels, tight skirts and have the most insane cars. It’s also about the dynamic between these six women in the office who love to hate each other. I’m half out the closet when it comes to my love of reality TV shows. Le Relais de Venise l’Entrecôte in Marylebone, London I live about a 20-minute walk away from this famous French steak restaurant. There’s always a queue, even pre-lockdown. The one thing you can order on the menu for delivery is La Baguette. It’s a gorgeous big piece of baguette, stuffed with steak that’s been chopped up, french fries and a sauce. I’ve been living nearby for 10 years and I always thought I should go. I had a birthday recently, and decided to order it. It was sensational. My boyfriend and I shared it. Every mouthful was an eye-roll of pleasure. It’s not cheap, but if there’s a special occasion…",culture
"On Tuesday evening the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, promised “jobs, jobs and jobs” and signalled a new fiscal strategy – one that for the first time was not focused on budget surplus. The arts sector dared to imagine this could mean increased support targeted at the hardest-hit, job-rich sectors with the most spare capacity. The added incentive of close to zero interest rates gave us hope for extra stimulus to fill the hole in the arts and culture sector left by Covid-19. Disappointingly, Tuesday’s budget speech provided yet another blow to a sector that is already struggling to survive the pandemic. The cultural and creative sector contributes $111.7bn to Australia’s economy (based on figures for 2016-17). But, since coming to power in 2013, Liberal-National Coalition governments have repeatedly delivered budgets that lack meaningful and substantial funding for arts and culture. It is important to acknowledge the aspects of the budget that have the potential to trickle down to artists and organisations indirectly: commitments to improved mental health support, the youth employment initiative, business asset write-offs, individual tax cuts, and increased assistance for artists living with disabilities, through the NDIS. This is where the extent of the potential impacts on the arts sector ends. The creative industries were ignored altogether in Frydenberg’s budget speech. Increases to the funding of national cultural institutions, where they have been granted, are so small as to be entirely meaningless once adjusted for inflation. Research from the Australia Institute shows that every million dollars invested in the arts creates nine jobs. In construction, that same investment generates just 0.9 to 1.3 jobs. Rather than investing in sectors with the greatest potential to support jobs and the return to work, the budget has instead committed to indirect job creation. The government has provided unprecedented support for private business, a decision that relies on the assumption and hope that businesses will retain and hire new staff amid an economic crisis. The budget commitments demonstrate the Morrison government’s lack of interest in redressing the debilitating impacts of Covid-19 on the arts sector. Despite the arts sector being the first and worst hit sector, and likely the last to recover, the budget fails to provide a roadmap for the sector based on bold, strategic vision and long-term recovery. The $250m committed this year – none of which has been spent – will do little to rebuild the arts sector, which is already weakened by exclusions from existing income support measures, cuts to local content quotas for Australian TV, and the increase of arts and humanities degree fees. The income tax cuts package will benefit high-income earners the most – and for longer – with a permanent $2,430 cut. Lower-income and middle-income earners (between $48,000 and $90,000) will receive a $1,080 tax cut for just one year. These cuts will have little to no impact on most artists, whose average income for their creative work alone is well below the poverty line: a mere $18,100, according to research by Australia Council for the Arts. Urgent investment in the arts has been ignored despite clear, consistent and united calls from the sector. The National Association for the Visual Arts’ submission before the budget was clear about what was needed to redress the long-term decline in funding that is damaging the arts industry, and making it harder for artists to sustain careers. We outlined the need for strategic investment to address the sector’s structural challenges concerning declines in artists’ incomes and career prospects, and worsening prospects for organisations’ sustainability. Calls for additional investment in the arts – $25m a year for the Australia Council and $2.5m a year for the regional arts fund – have also been ignored, when both have consistently been advocated by industry leaders and major cultural institutions including Regional Arts Australia. Moreover, the budget neglects the preferences of the majority of Australians (63% of us) who believe that arts and culture should be financially supported. The arts, alongside hospitality and tourism, will remain significant contributors to the economy after the pandemic and these sectors should not be left to falter without adequate government support during it. Those anxious about being left behind as jobkeeper and other Covid-19 supplements phase back will join the thousands of artists and arts workers who have disproportionately been excluded from the wage subsidy. The budget, even more so in times of a recession, should inspire confidence vital for post-pandemic recovery. The 2020-21 budget has highlighted the urgent need for a creative roadmap to restore and grow the sector, maximise its cultural and economic impact, and inspire confidence in our next generation of artists, audiences and critical thinkers to create our future.",culture
"June Sarpong has only been drunk precisely once. She was 20, working for Arista Records, and had helped organise the launch party for Janet Jackson’s 1997 album, The Velvet Rope. “Everyone was there –the Spice Girls. Naomi Campbell.” Sipping on a cup of hot water and lemon on a canalside terrace, she lets out a tickled “Whew!” at the recollection. Several tequila slammers and some pink champagne later, she pinballed home, woke up the next day “with zero hangover” and decided there and then that booze wasn’t for her. “But parties, I like. The Janet one is still one of the best I went to.” When pressed, Sarpong will admit that a do at Elton John’s mansion, a fashion party in Monaco with Hollywood A-listers, Ibiza’s Manumission in its live sex-show heyday and a charity event with Bono all rank fairly high on the list. “Wild,” she says, eyebrows raised but gossipy secrets sealed. “I’m an enabler,” she jokes. “I ply friends with alcohol when they come over, I just don’t participate.” Does she not get bored hanging out with drunk people? “In our industry? No! I’m used to it. Who isn’t drunk? The only people I notice are the ones who are sober,” she says, her glorious cartoon cackle let loose. For a particular generation, Sarpong’s laugh – an irresistible elastic giggle once described as “a celebratory roar that makes you imagine party poppers and champagne corks” – is etched in distant memory. Along with an obsessive lip gloss habit, it became her trademark when interviewing pop stars and confused-looking celebrities on MTV and T4, Channel 4’s weekend youth strand. Then, ironically, Sarpong’s languid, flirty delivery had viewers accuse her of being drunk as she and co-star Vernon Kay larked about on live TV. But she has never needed booze to be merry – a fact that probably helped when she began getting called on to do jobs that demanded hard work and squeaky-clean credentials: days of unprecedented access to Tony Blair for a documentary when he was prime minister; a gig presenting Nelson Mandela’s 90th birthday; being a tireless ambassador of the Prince’s Trust; as the face of the Make Poverty History campaign. At the beginning of her career she dated David Lammy (they split in 2003 and remain good friends), but she made lasting friendships across the Labour Party while hosting pop shows on telly. Now she is the author of three books – we’re meeting to discuss her third, The Power of Privilege, a smart and digestible manual on how white people can challenge racism – of the kind endorsed by Desmond Tutu and Kofi Annan. Last year the BBC headhunted her to become its creative director of diversity. It’s a huge job, albeit part-time for three days a week, that inserts itself in commissioning departments and channels across the board to try to achieve the BBC’s pledge that 20% of its workforce come from diverse backgrounds. In an organisation of 27,000 employees, Sarpong’s brief can’t be easy. “Well, we know that if you look at who’s had access to opportunity across the board, it’s been a very, very small group in society,” she says. “In order to reverse that and jumpstart the system, you have to intervene. People are very comfortable with targets and goals in all areas of business; it’s only when you start talking about targets for people that there is debate. But I’m not wasting time or energy with anyone who doesn’t want to do it. Especially when there are lots of people who do. My focus is there.” On the morning we meet, the actor Laurence Fox, a vocal critic of the BBC, has announced he is setting up a new political party to “reclaim” British values. The news comes days after Andrew Neil announces he is leaving the BBC to set up his own right-leaning opinionated 24-hour news channel, akin to Fox News. Does Sarpong worry that the “debate” is set to become that much more toxic and divisive? “I can’t speak on behalf of either of them, but I would tell you something: Andrew [Neil] is one of the most inclusive people in this industry, in terms of who he hires and promotes and champions. A lot of black people in the industry would agree. I don’t know what he’s doing with his news channel, but we do need to keep having sophisticated, nuanced conversations.” Sarpong waves a hand at the morally absolute framing of villains and heroes. “It’s too binary,” she says. “And life isn’t binary. We don’t allow people to be fully formed humans. The biggest misconception about me is that I’m ditsy. And sometimes you can be ditsy, but that does not mean you can’t be serious, methodical and strategic.” It’s worth remembering that Sarpong really was a rarity in the industry when she started out as a young, black woman fronting mainstream British TV. There were nicks made to her self-esteem and credibility along the way, but she always seemed to wear it lightly. When she joined MTV at 21, for instance, part of a new wave of female presenters including Cat Deeley, Edith Bowman and Donna Air, Sarpong was excluded from a magazine cover shoot celebrating the station’s hot new female talent. At the time, she shrugged it off. “The worst was that it wasn’t the magazine that had made the decision – it was MTV,” she says now. But she kept her head down and stuck to the immigrant parent script: you have to work twice as hard for half as much. Sarpong was born in east London in 1977 to Ghanian parents. The family, including her older brother Sam, moved back to Ghana when she was two to live a comfortably upper-middle-class life. Following the coup of 1981, the Sarpongs fled the country and ended up in a council estate in Walthamstow. Her parents divorced by the time she was seven; her father and Sam moved to the US and set up home there, while her mother worked as a nurse, remarried, and stayed in London with her three daughters. Sarpong said she “got on with everybody at school – the popular kids, the misfits, the geeks before they became cool,” but suffered a horrific car accident in her mid-teens and was immobile for two years. It didn’t dim her focus. “I turned up to my first job at Kiss FM in a neck brace,” she says, fondly name-checking Trevor Nelson as one of her first champions. “I wouldn’t be here without a lot of people who helped me and looked out for me along the way. That’s why it’s so important to keep paying it forward.” From Kiss FM onwards, Sarpong’s career seemed to rocket. At the height of her fame, she became a character on Bo’ Selecta! and Ricky Gervais wrote her into an episode of Extras. “I went as far as I could go here,” she says, her hand miming the ceiling. “I was committed to television, I wanted to be like Davina McCall. But what we call ‘shiny-floor shows’ [Saturday-night family TV shows] weren’t available to me.” By the end of 2007, like her peers Dermot O’Leary and Russell Brand, Sarpong had grown up and out of the youth TV she had come up with. She was awarded an MBE, called it quits on T4 and like plenty of black British talent before and after her, moved to the US. “I remember meeting with one particular senior executive for a more adult-focused documentary. A mandate had come on high from the boss to have me on board, but the executive couldn’t get past her preconceived ideas of who she thought I was. I was never patronised more in my life. My agent was furious. I just thought, ‘You know what, I don’t want to start doubting myself and my ability, my worth and value.’” In New York, Sarpong jumped in and expanded her wheelhouse: she became a businesswoman and co-founded WIE (Women: Inspiration and Enterprise) and put on conferences with the likes of Sheryl Sandberg and Arianna Huffington. She stayed for eight years before coming home and immediately joining the board of the Remain campaign. “That dinner [the night of the vote] with George Osborne and Peter Mandelson, when the results started coming in…” She lets out an exaggerated exhale. “Woooh, I gave up the ghost early. I left after Sunderland was called.” You can see why Sarpong is as well- connected and effective as she is, whether it’s presenting The Pledge on Sky News, a topical panel show with rightwing motormouths, such as Nick Ferrari, or being called on to sort out the Beeb. At 43, she values being able to understand and get on with people she fundamentally disagrees with in order to win rare, incremental, shifts in their perspectives. She’s not asking for a radical dismantling of the system, but aims to work within it. “I believe when life gives you lemons, you make lucrative lemonade. I love the younger generation; they’re not taking anything. They call me Aunty. I love it.” She laughs again. “We’re doing lots to level the playing field for them, but it’s not the same – it’s not. And sometimes we do our young people a disservice by making them think it is, because when they do come up against that kind of systemic racism, that systemic inequality, they are crushed by it.” Underneath her intensely likable effervescence, Sarpong is resolutely steely. It is curious how much she takes on – even her current CV lists a collection of board memberships and charity work – without feeling overwhelmed. Would she want another go at primetime TV? “I’m happy dabbling! I do The Pledge, I did a bit of Loose Women. It’s fun, but there is so much talent out there, I’m more excited about bringing the next generation through. I’ve done it.” Plus, she insists, “I think I’m better at listening than I am at talking,” which is saying something because Sarpong is a champion of chat. Not just easy, breezy nattering – the kind that gifted her the nonstop presenting jobs in her 20s and turns our one interview into two – but big, instead of small talk. “People often want to tell me their whole life story. Sometimes I’ll be sat at a dinner next to someone telling me things they’ve never told anyone else before. It happens a lot.” A lack of showbiz ego and an innate warmth on her part helps; the photo grapher and stylists melt when she starts gabbing. She’s a born butterfly. “If I hadn’t become a television presenter,” she says, “I’d probably be a therapist.” The surprising thing for anyone who remembers her best for creasing up while flirting with Jamie Foxx (“He’s quite a fruity guy, let’s just put it that way”) or taking Kanye West for a haircut (“Musical genius, but the worst: I never want to interview him again”), is how poised Sarpong 2.0 is. Everyone grows up, even if they were once the Tinkerbell of T4. And Sarpong has weathered her share of knocks. In 2015, Sarpong’s older brother, a seemingly happy and successful US model and actor, took his own life in California. Sam Sarpong Jr didn’t drink or do drugs, and had no known medical history of mental-health problems. The family was devastated; her father became a shell of his former self and June moved back to London, holding on hard to her Christian faith to get through the grief. “I’ve been through a lot of… I’ve had some shit in my life and I don’t want to go into it, but I’ve had some terrible times. And when you’ve been through that, you are grateful for an uneventful day, waking up happy, alive and healthy.” It’s a perspective that makes lockdown entirely bearable for her. If having to figure out five different video-meeting platforms in a day is as bad as it gets, she says she has little to complain about.  “I didn’t and I don’t have the luxury of being mediocre, or the luxury of people assuming my opinion is valid because of the package I come in,” she says, matter of factly. “I’ve always been doubted – I didn’t go to university, I’m not Oxbridge-educated, but I never allowed that to bother me, because I’ve never believed that is the only sign of intelligence. What I do know is that if somebody has hired me – even if they consider it the diversity hire – I know when I get there that I can do the job. I’m not doubtful.” The Power of Privilege by June Sarpong, is out now HQ £5). Buy a copy for £4.65 at guardianbookshop.com.

"More than 400 heritage sites in England, from the Blyth Tall Ship in Northumberland to Bodmin Jail Museum in Cornwall, are to receive money from a £103m rescue fund to help them through the coronavirus crisis. On Friday the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, announced long-awaited details of the first major tranche of funding from the government’s £1.57bn culture recovery fund. It includes £67m to 433 organisations who applied for grants of less than £1m each to help them survive the pandemic. Another £34m will go towards restarting stalled construction and maintenance works at major heritage sites. A further £2m has been awarded to the Architectural Heritage Fund. The money is from the Treasury, but decisions on who gets what were made by Historic England and the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The fund’s chief executive, Ros Kerslake, said the government support was crucial, but added: “Our heritage is still facing a perilous future – we are not out of the woods yet.” It was right that investing in heritage was a priority, she said. “Heritage creates jobs and economic prosperity, is a major driver for tourism and makes our towns, cities and rural areas better places to live. All of this is so important for our wellbeing and will be particularly vital when we start to emerge from this incredibly difficult time.” Details of the fund were announced on the same day that 1,300 job cuts at the National Trust were announced. The charity said it had more than halved the number of compulsory redundancies it had expected to make as a result of the coronavirus crisis, but 782 people had taken voluntary redundancy and 514 people would be made compulsorily redundant after the biggest redundancy consultation process in its 125-year history. Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said it was heartening to see money going to sites and organisations that had been hit hard by coronavirus. “These grants range from giving skilled craft workers the chance to keep their trades alive to helping heritage organisations pay the bills,” he said. They would also kickstart repairs “at our best-loved historic sites”. He said: “The funding is an essential lifeline for our heritage and the people who work tirelessly to conserve it for us all, so that we can hand it on to future generations.” The grants include money to sites that often draw tourists because of their links to film and television. Highclere Castle, famous for being the setting of Downton Abbey, gets £72,000; Gloucester Cathedral, whose cloisters were used as Hogwarts, gets £200,000; and Wentworth Woodhouse, a vast Georgian mansion in Rotherham that doubled as Buckingham Palace in the film Darkest Hour, gets £468,300. The recipients include smaller, quirkier places that would be a big loss to the cultural fabric. For example, the Shell Grotto in Margate, a strange place that is either a Victorian folly or an ancient temple, depending on who you talk to. It put in a bid with Margate Caves and receives £48,200. The grotto’s owner, Sarah Vickery, told the Guardian that being closed from March to July had been incredibly tough. “We lost an awful lot of income. To be honest, so much I’ve not wanted to add it up … you’ve got to preserve your sanity.” Despite that, Vickery said she had never given up. “The grotto has been open to the public since 1838, it will take more than this to close it. We were always going to find a way through, although I wasn’t sure what that would be for a long time.” The government money may not sound a lot but she said for them, a “micro-attraction”, it was an important lifeline. “It’s really great. It basically means we can stay open all the way through winter.” Nearly 20 cathedrals will receive chunks of money, including Canterbury (£999,200), Winchester (£948,200), Wells, (£201,300) and Salisbury (£245,000). Other recipients include the International Bomber Command Centre in Lincolnshire (£426,700), Blyth Tall Ship (£51,400), the Piece Hall in Halifax (£995,000), Blackpool’s Winter Gardens (£846,600) and the Severn Valley Railway in Worcestershire (£906,000). The £34m heritage stimulus fund will be divided out to 12 heritage organisations including the National Trust (£6m), the Canal & River Trust (£1.6m) and Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), which looks after buildings including the Tower of London and Hampton Court Palace. HRP receives just over £3m. Lucy Worsley, its chief curator, said the organisation would now be able to resume critical conservation work. “There’s no truer way to experience the past than to walk in the footsteps who have lived it,” she said. “That’s why preserving our heritage is so important.” Dowden said: “As a nation it is essential that we preserve our heritage and celebrate and learn from our past. This massive support package will protect our shared heritage for future generations, save jobs and help us prepare for a cultural bounce back post-Covid.” Heritage leaders have welcomed the news that money from the cultural recovery package will finally start flowing. Arts organisations including theatres, museums, galleries and music venues are still waiting to hear if they have been successful in getting critical rescue money. Those announcements are expected early next week.",culture
"You’ll remember the skulls, if nothing else. Even if you weren’t one of the 1.23 million people who attended the National Gallery of Victoria’s inaugural Triennial in 2017, you will have seen Ron Mueck’s colossal installation, Mass: enormous piles of oversized skulls scattered across a gallery space and dutifully Instagrammed by every attendee with a smartphone. The NGV’s second Triennial – which the gallery announced on Thursday will open on 19 December – is slated to be of much the same scale as its first. Eighty-six projects from more than 100 artists from around the world will grace the spaces of the cavernous St Kilda Road premises, and the organisation is hoping that after eight months in lockdown Melburnians will be keen to get out and see it – and placing a heavy bet on the hopes that they will be able to get out at all. Assuming they can, they’ll get to see artworks from the likes of Jeff Koons, Tony Albert, JR, Faye Toogood, Dhambit Mununggurr, Kengo Kuma and many more from across the globe. But that won’t be possible until Victoria reaches the “last stage” of its Covid recovery roadmap, when there have been zero new cases in the community for more than 14 days – a situation the gallery (and everyone else) is hoping will happen before the Triennial opens. Managing an exhibition of this scale is no small feat in ordinary times, but the pandemic – and the state government’s stringent lockdown restrictions caused by Victoria’s second wave – has added an extraordinary extra layer of complexity to the production. In some ways the gallery was lucky: the first wave broke at the opposite end of the year to the scheduled opening of the project that has been three years in the making, meaning it was possible to envision it could still happen on schedule, while other projects were necessarily either shelved or kicked down the road. That didn’t mean that the exhibition could stay the same.  “Artists have changed or adapted some projects in light of the things that have happened,” says Don Heron, NGV’s assistant director of exhibition management and design. It’s his job to oversee the Triennial’s logistics: the design of the spaces, the installation of the works, and actually getting the art to Melbourne in the first place. “We had to revisit how [those pieces] might work, how audiences might interact with them, how much space is required for them to work effectively.” The Los Angeles-based Japanese artist Misaki Kawai, for example, had been commissioned to create an interactive piece for the children’s gallery featuring large, shaggy dog sculptures, a puppet-making studio and recording booths for puppet performances – an incredibly tactile work that required some rethinking. “We had to move from a hands-on mode to a hands-free mode,” says Heron. NGV’s multimedia team collaborated with Kawai’s studio to turn, for example, touch-screen elements into foot-activated trigger mats on the floor. Instead of punching your details into a computer screen, QR codes will be used to facilitate video sharing of the puppet performances. While some artists have evolved their work, others have completely shifted gear. The UK artist Alice Potts had planned to travel to Australia to continue her Sweat series: a project that involves turning perspiration samples into unexpectedly beautiful crystals, and incorporating them back into garments – football boots, ballet slippers and gymwear. That stopped being viable with the global circulation of a highly contagious virus that is spread through close contact and bodily fluids. Potts’ new work, Dance Biodegradable Personal Protective Equipment (DBPPE) Post COVID Facemasks, was inspired by a phone call from her London paramedic brother during the onset of the pandemic who had resorted to wearing bin liners for masks, such was the scarcity of PPE at the time. Getting the art to Australia also required tactical thinking. Freight flights weren’t leaving London, so works from the UK were bundled together and sent by rail to Amsterdam to meet a plane bound for Melbourne. Installation, particularly of site-specific work, has been a challenge, but Heron has nothing but praise for how the artists have handled it. “Artists and designers are problem-solvers by nature,” says Heron. “A challenge comes up or something that might be an impediment and they’re very good at finding a way to work through that.” The practical solutions involve the gallery’s design team doing more work in advance to create 3D visualisations of how works might look in a particular space, and coordinating with those artists online as things shift. Things may change again once the work is in situ, Heron says, but “that happens all the time”. His team has also reassessed the layout of the gallery to allow free movement between rooms and enough space for people to physically distance from each other while viewing the works. The result will be a more open-plan exhibition than some of the labyrinths of past shows, but it may come as a relief for those patrons who loathe crowded gallery corners. The 2017 Triennal remains the NGV’s most popular exhibition ever. If there were ambitions to repeat or best that success this time around, Heron is not admitting to it – particularly with closed borders and Melburnians who have grown wary of crowds. “I think it’s fair to say you’re not going to get the numbers that you would normally get,” he says. “But we certainly really hope that the Triennial is something that will appeal to a really diverse and broad amount of our community. “We’re really hopeful that people will come out to enjoy it, and hopefully we can provide a really good, safe space for them to do that.”",culture
"Late-night hosts addressed the White House’s coronavirus outbreak after a whirlwind weekend of headlines, health updates and spin that was overwhelming even by Trump-era standards. “Turns out while you’ve spent the last seven months hugging your grandma through a giant condom, Trump and his friends are having no-mask cocktail receptions indoors where the guest of honor is Covid-19,” said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. At least 30 people in Trump’s circle have tested positive for the virus since last week, including aide Hope Hicks, adviser Kellyanne Conway, and personal assistant Nick Luna. “It’s almost as if the writers of 2020 didn’t know how to wrap the story up so then they were like ‘uh, and then they all get coronavirus, the end,’” Noah said. For those who proclaimed that Trump’s infection was merely karma for downplaying a pandemic that has now killed more than 200,000 Americans, Noah offered a correction: “A massive outbreak at the White House is not karma. It’s consequences.” It’s bad enough that Trump’s White House flouted safety protocols before an outbreak, he continued, but “what’s even more disturbing is that after Trump found out that he could’ve been exposed to the virus, he didn’t quarantine. He didn’t social distance. He carried on with his life with complete disregard for other people’s lives.” Trump attended a fundraiser, sans mask, in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday evening despite knowing before leaving Washington that close aide Hicks had tested positive for the virus, a which is “truly despicable”, said Noah. “Trump knew that he could be infected and he put his own supporters at risk anyway? I feel so bad for anyone who paid money to attend this fundraiser,” he added. “Because those people didn’t want Covid. They just wanted to give Trump enough money so that he’d let them dump chemicals in a river. Why should something bad happen to them?” Trump returned home from Walter Reed medical center on Monday evening with a photo op in which he removed his mask on the steps of the White House. “My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone he’s about to infect,” said Stephen Colbert. “I’m glad the president is feeling better,” the Late Show host added, “and of course I wish him continued good health, and it goes without saying: what a tool.” Upon leaving Walter Reed, Trump tweeted that he was “feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life.” “So you’re saying the people who lost their lives, they either didn’t have enough moxie,” Colbert retorted, “or they didn’t live in a White House that has 20 full-time medical staff and get choppered to a suite at Walter Reed, where they received a combination of cutting-edge treatments that literally no one else on the planet has received?” On Late Night, Seth Meyers replayed footage from Trump’s widely condemned PR stunt on Sunday in which he demanded Secret Service agents drive him around Walter Reed in a hermetically sealed SUV to wave to admirers. The image of an infected president sealed inside a parade vehicle with as-yet-uninfected staff “captures all the heedless negligence and disregard for human life that has characterized the Trump administration and its response to the pandemic”, Meyers said. “He exposed Secret Service agents among others to a deadly virus just for a quick ego boost. “So what prompted this reckless jaunt that put people in harm’s way?” Meyers wondered. According to the Washington Post, Trump told advisers on Sunday that he was bored of sitting in the hospital and tired of watching news coverage of his hospitalization. “Bored? Your hospital suite is basically a luxury apartment,” Meyers retorted. “That room and your top-of-the-line medical care probably cost more than the $750 you paid in taxes.” The election, the White House outbreak at the Rose Garden party for Trump’s supreme court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, the confusing timelines on Trump’s Covid diagnosis from his doctors – “in a way, it’s all one story,” said Meyers. “That’s maybe the most bewildering fact of life in the Trump era: every day there’s a shocking new thing you could never have imagined in your wildest dreams, yet at the same time, every Trump story is basically the same Trump story: we can’t believe a word the president or his aides say. We have no idea what to believe.” And on The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon recapped Trump’s PR ride around Walter Reed, in which “the Secret Service had to take Trump around after 50 Uber XL drivers were like, ‘Hell no,’” he joked. “What is happening? Trump even turned a hospital stay into chaos. The Joker caused less problems when he visited Gotham General.” The stunt coincided with reports that Don Jr was “deeply upset” by the ride-around and thought his father was “acting crazy”. “You know things have gone off the rails when Don Jr becomes the voice of reason,” Fallon said. As for criticism of a photo the White House posted from Walter Reed to show Trump “working” by signing what appears to be a blank sheet of paper, Fallon joked it wasn’t all staged – “that’s not blank piece of paper, that’s just his entire plan to stop Covid.”",culture
"Professional female artists in Australia can expect to earn on average 25% less than their male counterparts, according to new research released on Wednesday by Macquarie University – and that figure rises to 30% when it comes to how much money professional female artists can expect to earn from the work they produce. The grim findings are the result of an analysis of income data from 826 working artists across multiple art forms – from visual arts and music to performance and writing – in 2016 and 2017, conducted by the university’s economics department.  Four years ago the gender pay gap between full-time working men and full-time working women across every industry and occupational category in Australia was 16%. In the succeeding interval, that gap has narrowed to 13.9% – the equivalent of $242.90 per week – according to data from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The university drew upon the Australia Council’s national survey of practising professional artists, Making Art Work, then set about exploring the variables that might explain the gaping gender pay gap. A co-author of the preliminary paper, Dr Sunny Y Shin, told Guardian Australia that the discrepancy between male and female earnings could still not be explained after taking into account multiple mitigating factors. “We looked at standard questions. For example, are women simply working less hours? That’s not true, the hours are similar,” she said. “So are women working in the arts less educated? That’s not true either – women are more educated in these fields. Do they have a higher rate of disability, or non-English speaking backgrounds, or have more children? “None of these could explain the different rate of return for men and women.  “We’re left with the conclusion that women [working in the arts] seem to be the subject of gender-related discrimination.” As part of the research, artists were asked what they thought was the most important factor that had advanced their career. “Women said ‘support from friends and family’ more than men did, and men reported more that it was their own talent,” she said. In First Nations communities, the gender pay gap between male and female artists was almost non-existent. Shin said the findings were preliminary and the issue of virtual income parity among Indigenous artists needed to be examined further, along with additional variables. Different approaches between male and female artists towards risk, competition and negotiation also needed to be examined further, she said. The research comes on the back of an analysis prepared for the Arts Industry Council of South Australia, using ABS data. The analysis found that during the Covid-19 pandemic, 36% of female job losses in the arts sector in South Australia translated to a 13.2% loss in wages, compared with a 27.5% job loss rate among males, resulting in 23% total wage loss. To mark International Women’s Day last year, the Museum of Contemporary Art published interviews discussing gender discrimination with three female artists featured in its collection. One was Janet Laurence, who said the public’s perception of artists being these “big heroic male figures” continued to be reinforced by Australia’s conservative press and political institutions. Sanné Mestrom said she believed there was now a lot of support for female artists. “However, the fact that there is such support actually points to the lack of it – and the need for it – in a broader sense,” she said. “Until women’s representation in exhibitions and collections is 50/50 with men, there remains work to be done.” Fiona Hall said she suspected she may have semi-consciously “opted to ignore/defy/deflect” any gender bias she may have encountered in her career. “I’m aware, though, that it’s too often a factor in the career trajectories of female artists – and it all too often begins at art school,” she said.",culture
"Late-night hosts appeared generally jubilant on Monday evening, the first night of shows since American networks called the election for former vice-president Joe Biden on Saturday. “Darth Tax Evader has been toppled, and America responded with a dance party,” said Jimmy Kimmel before a montage of Americans from New York to Los Angeles dancing in the streets to celebrate Trump’s defeat. “Meanwhile, our out-of-touch-with-reality host is not letting go,” said Kimmel. “He is both melting and doubling down on his claim that the election was stolen from him” with baseless claims of voter fraud that have been roundly dismissed in court. Nevertheless, the Trump campaign is “getting all the sycophants on board to question the integrity of the election” although that of course does not include the Republican House and Senate seats won with the same ballots. “I wonder why that is?” Kimmel deadpanned. “Why would the Democrats have cheated and stolen the presidency but given up the Senate and House seats on the same ballot? Is it like when you cheat on a test and you get a few wrong just to throw the teacher off the scent? Are we supposed to believe there’s a universe in which Nancy Pelosi could’ve sent Mitch McConnell back to the exotic pets store he came from and she chose not to? “Listen, I get that this is hard for Donald Trump,” Kimmel conceded. “Processing a loss like this is gonna take time. I mean, this is the first time he’s ever failed at anything – besides his casinos, his airline, his mortgage, Trump steaks, Trump university, Trump magazine, Donald Jr, Eric, etc.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert celebrated Biden’s victory with a T-shirt cannon, glasses of champagne, and footage of jubilant parties across the US. Though Trump has refused to concede the election, shattering precedent, and congressional Republicans have almost uniformly fallen in line behind him, “it’s over,” said Colbert. The news of Trump’s defeat brought tears of relief and joy, Colbert revealed, especially for the long list of things to look forward to: extra brain space, a chance to be nicer. “I tend to reflect back the national tone, and that tone comes from the top,” Colbert explained. “The president’s only emotions are angry, look-at-me, and ‘I’m angry you’re not looking at me,’ and because he was the only thing we were focused on for the last four years – and this is entirely my responsibility – I’ve done harsher jokes than I’ve ever done in my entire life.” But mostly, Colbert was “looking forward to the idea of knowing things again”. “We’ve spent the last four years debating the value of the Enlightenment with a reality show host,” he added. “If the president were there when the apple hit Newton on the head, he would’ve called gravity a ‘Chinese hoax’ and the apple ‘Tim Apple’.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers tallied the many upsides to a Joe Biden presidency: “in addition to preserving what’s left of our democracy, reversing four years of malicious racism, savagery and criminal neglect, getting rid of Trump is just a quality of life issue,” he said, “like calling 311 about a jackhammer outside of your apartment. “And clearly I’m not the only one indulging myself in the joy and catharsis of seeing this deeply wretched husk of a man thrown out on his ass,” he added before footage of ecstatic election celebrations across the country. Meanwhile, on Fox News, Tucker Carlson tried to sow fear over the president-elect: “There is no Joe Biden. The man you remember from the 1980s is gone. He no longer exists. What remains is a projection of sorts, a hologram designed to mimic the behavior of a non-threatening political candidate.” Meyers responded: “By the way, to anyone who thought things were going to go back to normal once Trump was gone, just a reminder: Fox News called Biden a hologram who wants to force you to drink Starbucks, and he’s been president-elect for two days. “Can you imagine what it’s going to be like when Biden’s actually in office if Republicans hang on to control the Senate? Who knows if they’ll even let him have a cabinet? Sean Hannity will probably accuse Biden of building a Soros-funded Amtrak station on the moon.” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped the Republican blitz of laughably evidence-free claims of election fraud, which have been dismissed in courts from Michigan to Pennsylvania. “Are these guys kidding us? This was so batshit, I caught coronavirus just listening to it,” Noah said of some of the attempts to delegitimize the election. The GOP’s false cries of foul play are especially ironic, said Noah, because “America’s whole system is rigged – to help Donald Trump. The man lost by 4 million popular votes and still had a chance to win the electoral college. How does that make sense? The only person Donald Trump should be mad at is himself, because he started on third base and still somehow lost the game. “Maybe Trump will decide to concede eventually,” he later added. “Or, hey, maybe he won’t. That actually doesn’t really matter either way because it’s not his decision to make. Joe Biden is going to become president on January 20, and Trump’s opinion on that counts for exactly one vote. Same as any other vote in America. And I know it’s hard to believe but after all this time, it seems like reality has finally caught up with Donald Trump.”",culture
"There’s a glimmer of positivity amid Australia’s beleaguered arts industries: with Covid-19 restrictions limiting our ability to attend live shows or go to cinemas, book sales across the country have surged – with many readers returning to familiar authors, and the escapist comforts of fiction. According to Nielsen Book Australia, which tracks book sales nationally, the Australian market for books experienced a “steep decline” early in the year, but turned a corner over Easter and has been growing ever since. Adult fiction has done particularly well, with the firm noting a 13% rise in sales value in the year to mid-October. “People have more time to read the books they had always wanted to, either from their own bookshelf or a bestseller they had never got around to buying,” says HarperCollins chief executive Jim Demetriou, name-checking two of the company’s titles – Trent Dalton’s Boy Swallows Universe, and George RR Martin’s Game of Thrones – as bestsellers. In contemporary fiction, Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens and the final instalment of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall trilogy, The Mirror & the Light, have also been notable sellers. Bookshops are noticing trends too. During Brisbane’s lockdown earlier in the year, Chris Oliver, owner of Little Bird Bookshop, saw a rise in the sales of Australian books. “People have become interested in knowing their own city because they obviously aren’t traveling internationally, and they couldn’t even travel interstate, to a large extent.” He also noticed a shift away from new releases towards classics. Anna MacDonald, a bookseller at the Paperback Bookshop in Melbourne’s central business district, says one customer picked up six volumes of Proust at the beginning of the city’s second lockdown. “He said in the first lockdown he’d read Dostoevsky, and now in the second lockdown he was going to work his way through Proust.” Staff there have been offering personalised recommendations to online customers based on books they have previously enjoyed. Since March, the store has posted books daily on its website and social media platforms. “One of the challenges for us during the lockdown has been to find ways of maintaining that personal relationship with customers,” MacDonald says. “Sales have taken a pretty hard hit but we are still making enough to make ends meet.” In non-fiction, Australians responded strongly to the global protests sparked by the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, with books including Stan Grant’s Talking To My Country, Marcia Langton’s Welcome To Country, and Bruce Pascoe’s Dark Emu selling well. “That was really exciting to see Australian readers looking to books to inform and to guide them,” says Louise Sherwin-Stark, CEO of Hachette Australia & New Zealand, which publishes Me and White Supremacy by Layla Saad and So You Want To Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo. Books that offer practical ways of passing time have also sold well, including cookbooks, gardening and craft books, and a resurgence in adult colouring-in books. But while business is booming for online booksellers – Booktopia reported a 28% increase in sales in the 2020 financial year, driven substantially by Covid lockdowns – bricks and mortar stores have had an uneven year. In parts of the country now minimally affected by Covid-19 restrictions, physical bookshops are flourishing. “In small country towns, people have been tremendous in supporting local business,” says Diana Johnston, a book buyer for independent franchise group Collins Booksellers. “Our stores in the country have been doing exceptionally well.” For Michael Roach at the Book Cellar in Campbell Town, Tasmania – a town of fewer than 1,000 people, located between Hobart and Launceston – the absence of international tourists since March has been countered by strong online sales. “We had our best ever week’s trade when one particular book [Alice Irvine’s Central Cookery Book] took off online and we were the main supplier of it,” Roach says. But it’s been a difficult period for Melbourne booksellers, particularly those affected by a drastic drop in foot traffic through the CBD. Johnson, from Collins Booksellers, also co-owns the beloved Hill of Content, where sales have been “decimated”, she says. “Our turnover has probably dropped by about 80%.” The store is building its fledgling online business, which it launched in November last year. Johnston says that jobkeeper and the support from regular customers – some of whom have been frequenting the store for decades – have been lifelines, but she expects a lasting downturn in the coming months, as people continue to work from home and theatres remain shut. “We just have to adjust accordingly.” “Booksellers are really good at encouraging readers to try something they haven’t tried before,” says Sherwin-Stark, from Hachette. In the absence of personal recommendations, readers have returned to familiar favourites – Michael Robotham, Nick Earls and Jodi Picoult among them. Debut literary authors, for whom physical events are an important promotional tool, have had a tough year as a result, says Sherwin-Stark. And though virtual events have allowed authors to reach larger audiences, digital event fatigue has been a downside – which is why some publishers delayed the release of key titles to later in the year, in the hopes that in-person events would be possible by then. “Jane Harper, Trent Dalton, Andy Griffiths, Richard Flanagan – all of these people have published books in the last couple of weeks,” says Sherwin-Stark, in an interview at the end of October. Dalton’s All Our Shimmering Skies was delayed from June to October. “What you’re seeing now is a hugely crowded market” for publishers – but “for readers, the best Christmas of all time”.",culture
"I’ve seen a lot and it still comes back to Sean Lock. When we used to play the clubs together, he was pretty much the only one that all us other comics on the bill would come out front to watch; I mean properly watch, like a punter. Probably Monty Python’s Albatross sketch. That beat John Cleese leaves between Terry Jones asking him whether “you get wafers with it” and his follow-up makes it. It peters out after that, but that’s always been the problem with sketches for me: often the journey is far better than the destination. Got to be The Harry Hill Movie, right? Channel 4 occasionally put it out at about seven in the morning! I caught a bit the other day, having not seen it for years and, rather embarrassingly, found myself really laughing! OK, you got me: The Producers. I collect joke books, but they don’t count, right? Then I’d go for The Tetherballs of Bougainville by Mark Leyner. It hasn’t really got a story as such, but it’s just packed full of funny, odd ideas.  Extras was great, wasn’t it? The Bowie bit. I have huge admiration for Ricky Gervais’s single-mindedness. I remember him when he was the entertainments manager at the University of London Union, and I also remember feeling a bit sorry for him! Neat the way it turned out. I worked in a pub at weekends when I was a teenager and there was no scheduled break for me and this girl that worked there – and we were scared of the boss, who was a highly strung Swede. One day she went out for a couple of hours, so we laid a table up in the pub and cooked ourselves a meal. Sausage and chips never tasted so good.  Wait a minute, you’re really asking this question of the man who does the voiceover for You’ve Been Framed!? Kitten falling off the draining board into the swing bin gets me every time. But, of course, it has to get out of the swing bin too, to prove it’s OK. Egg. Go on, say it again but imagine me saying it. Funny, right?

"Melburnians have until this Sunday to view a Brett Whiteley work that is expected to break all Australian art records when it goes under the hammer in Sydney on 26 November. Henri’s Armchair, an exceptionally large oil, ink and charcoal on canvas work from the artist’s famous Lavender Bay series, painted in 1974, is expected to fetch between $5m and $7m when it goes to auction in just under three weeks. The price estimate is set to easily tip the longstanding record for an artwork sold in Australia, set by Sidney Nolan’s First-class Marksman from his Ned Kelly series, which the Art Gallery of New South Wales paid $5.4m for in 2010. Justin Turner, head of art at Menzies Art Brands, which also sold the Nolan, said he believed the Whiteley would “breeze through” the record books. Renown barrister Clive Evatt QC bought the painting directly from the artist in 1975, where it hung in the lawyer’s Turramurra home until his death in 2018. In what has surprisingly turned out to be a booming art market in 2020, his widow Elizabeth Evatt has now decided to sell the work, Turner said. “In 2020 we have seen 20 new artist price records set at auction,” Turner said. “Despite the global pandemic, it has been an incredibly buoyant year for the Australian art market, with numerous new artist auction price records being set and clearance rates across the major art auction houses, both by value and volume, proving to be exceptionally strong.” Turner said Henri’s Armchair was Whiteley’s nod to French impressionist Henri Matisse, who once claimed art should “be something like a good armchair in which to rest from physical fatigue”. The work arrives in Sydney next week, with by-appointment-only viewings beginning in Kensington on 12 November.",culture
"The comedian, mimic and actor John Sessions, who has died of a heart attack aged 67, had trouble being John Sessions. “The hardest part you’ll ever play, honey, is yourself,” he told an interviewer in 1994. Instead, he transformed himself into other people. His breakthrough 1987 one-man West End stage show, The Life of Napoleon, for instance, was described thus by one critic: “In the course of a few sentences Sessions is liable to change voices from Olivier to Lofty of EastEnders, include a pun and a simile, refer to Picasso and Faulkner and move from the battle of Jena to a golf course. It is exhausting, exhilarating and mostly very funny.” Sessions made his name on TV in the comedy show Whose Line Is It Anyway? (1988-91), in which contestants (other regulars included Stephen Fry and Josie Lawrence) would improvise sketches suggested by the studio audience. He was in his element, imagining how James Joyce would spend a day at the beach, or how Hemingway might behave at the dentist. When the contestants were asked to impersonate the person they would least like to be trapped with in a lift, Paul Merton said: “Hello, my name is John Sessions.” Sessions took it on the chin: “A lot of people found me infuriating – they thought I was a smart aleck, but I did try not to be.” And yet on that show, and others, including the BBC’s panel show QI, he never wore his learning lightly, outsmarting the erudite Fry in the first episode of QI in 2003 by knowing Michelangelo’s dates of birth and death. Unlike many of his peers, he had not been to Oxbridge, and he had failed to complete his PhD thesis on the poet John Cowper Powys. Had he become Dr Sessions, wrote one armchair analyst, “perhaps he would not feel compelled to display his erudition; but then he would have been lost to the stage, which would have been a pity”. The smart aleck image stuck, so much so that when Spitting Image produced a puppet of Sessions in 1989, he was represented disappearing up his own fundament. Sessions was singular in having served on the show both as impressionist (his 40-voice repertoire included Prince Edward, Laurence Oliver, Norman Tebbit and Keith Richards) and target. His appearance as a rubberised member of Kenneth Branagh’s Brit Pack discombobulated Sessions: “Suddenly on the telly I saw this brilliant puppet with this funny tie and baggy cheeks and it was me going up my ass. That was quite scary. I thought, ‘Am I going up my ass?’” Such self-doubt was typical. Sessions was prone to depression, said he loathed his appearance, and was given in interviews to self-laceration. In 1999 he told the Sunday Times: “Some nights, I can’t get to sleep and lie there looking back on my life and eventually nod off thinking, ‘I’m completely useless and hopeless, talentless and should fuck off.’” He was not mollified when the interviewer told him no one else had ever had that thought about him. He was born in Largs, Ayrshire. His father, John Marshall, was a peripatetic gas engineer, and a Protestant; his mother, Esmé (nee Richardson), was a Glaswegian Catholic ostracised by her family when she got married. He had a twin sister, Maggie, and an older brother, Bill, who was 12 when the twins were born. “I remember thinking I mustn’t cause my parents any trouble, because they were that much older.” He liked to be at home with his mother: “We used to have a sort of confidentiality of humour. We’d find funny the unacknowledgedly absurd. Which I think is the type of stuff I do, and which still makes me laugh.”  When John was three, the family moved to England, eventually settling in St Albans, where he was educated at Verulam school. He did his first impersonation aged seven, singing Lonnie Donegan’s Hang Down Your Head Tom Dooley, partly to impress his father.  He went to Bangor University to read English with the aim of becoming a teacher. Then his father organised a personnel job for him at the gas board. “I told Dad it was boring, and the next thing he knew was that I was going off to do a PhD in Ontario.” He found Canada cold and depressing, and said that his uncompleted dissertation consisted of “200 pages of rubbish”. Aged 26, he returned to the UK and applied to Rada. He arrived at his audition with a hangover. “I did Benedick’s ‘This can be no trick …’ from Much Ado. Hugh Cruttwell [Rada’s principal] said: ‘That was terrible. You weren’t acting, you were doing an impersonation of what an actor sounds like.’” But a second performance, from Pinter’s The Homecoming, won him a scholarship. Better, it led to a lifelong friendship with Branagh, a fellow student, who later directed him on stage in The Life of Napoleon and in the film version of Henry V (1989) and his comedy In the Bleak Midwinter (1995). Finding there was another John Marshall in Equity, he changed his name to Sessions. When he left Rada, he said, “my plan was to try and do two careers at once – to be a comedian and an actor. For some years, I managed to juggle the two, but I never felt I joined either club.” He worked the comedy circuit in London, sometimes appearing on the same bill as French and Saunders, often doing rarefied material, such as imagining Milan Kundera’s version of the TV soap Dallas. He would cement his brand as abstruse improv virtuoso with the TV shows John Sessions’ Tall Tales (1991) and John Sessions’ Likely Stories (1994). In 1994, in an interview promoting his performance in Kevin Elyot’s Aids drama My Night With Reg, he was asked by an interviewer if he was gay. “I said ‘Yes I am, but my parents don’t know, and I don’t want them to find out by picking up a copy of the Evening Standard.’ The journalist said she thought I should tell them and outed me. My mother died unexpectedly six weeks later, and my father quickly developed dementia. It was never mentioned.” Sessions explained his compunctions about telling his parents about his sexuality. “They weren’t going to go to their graves hating me or throw me out of the house, but they were born before the first world war and they might have died thinking it was their ‘fault’.” One night at the Criterion theatre during My Night With Reg, Sessions forgot his lines and had to leave the stage. “It wasn’t stage fright, because I’d been on for six weeks. It was because everything got too much for me. I’d been home for Christmas and found that my father, who was suffering from a mental illness after my mother died, had filled the fridge full of presents for her.” After that, he did not return to theatre for many years. “I should have gone to the RSC or the National and done four or five plays, really worked my arse off. Some good old-fashioned graft would have done me the power of good. But I couldn’t face a play again.” Only in 2013 did he return to the stage, in his friend the novelist William Boyd’s play Longing. “I thought it was going to lead to all kinds of interesting things, but I wasn’t killed in the rush.” He never recaptured the fame of his first few years in TV. “I had a twinkly couple of years, but then I ran out of steam,” he told the Guardian in 2014. “As I was getting older, I wasn’t getting more confident, I was getting less confident. I lost my way.” Arguably, he found it again through his talent for mimicry, when he starred in and co-wrote Stella Street, the 1997-2001 BBC series that imagined a street in Surbiton populated by movie stars.  Mimicry served him well in later triumphs on TV and in the cinema. He was Geoffrey Howe in Margaret (2009), Harold Wilson in Made in Dagenham (2010), Ted Heath in The Iron Lady (2011), Norman Tebbit in The Hunt for Tony Blair (2011), and in 2015 he was note perfect as Arthur Lowe performing Captain Mainwaring in We’re Doomed! The Dad’s Army Story. His later roles were mainly minor ones, but he stole the show as Dr Prunesquallor, oleaginous royal physician to the House of Groan in the 2000 adaptation of Mervyn Peake’s Gormenghast. Away from stage and screen, Sessions claimed to be a loner. “I like the solitary life,” he once said. Latterly, the man of a thousand characters found consolation in playing the role of an ageing buffer drifting rightwards politically. He had once supported Labour but later voted for Ukip, saying that “the European Union is the biggest money-wasting piece of shit” and that the Scottish parliament should be scrapped. “I’m pretty much one character really,” he reflected. “A grumpy old fool.” He is survived by his sister and brother.",culture
"Queensland Theatre has responded to criticisms over its 2021 program, with artistic director Lee Lewis acknowledging that having just one First Nations work in the season was “not ideal” – and that leaving it out of the season announcement was “a fail”. The program, announced on Sunday, has been criticised by industry heavyweights including two former Queensland Theatre artistic directors: Sydney Festival director Wesley Enoch and theatre director Sam Strong. Enoch told the Courier Mail on Wednesday he was “shocked and disappointed that all the work we’ve been doing over a decade seems to have disappeared. There will be lots of excuses but when push came to shove it seemed the thing to leave out was the blackfellas.” On Facebook, Strong addressed the anger expressed by Enoch and other Indigenous artists, including Chenoa Deemal and Elaine Crombie. “Hopefully, this difficult moment is one in which anger can be heard and acknowledged, mistakes owned, and First Nations artists embraced and celebrated by the company,” he said. In an apology and statement released on Thursday, the company acknowledged that the announcement of its 2021 program had cast doubt on its commitment to developing First Nations works. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” it said. “While our 2021 Season in Brisbane does not include a First Nations work, we will be presenting Othello, adapted by Jason Klarwein and Jimi Bani, in Cairns in 2021 to coincide with the Cairns Indigenous Arts Fair (CIAF). “We did not include this in the season launch as the date for CIAF in 2021 is yet to be finalised. This was a mistake.” Lewis, who lamented the lack of racial diversity in Australian theatre in a Currency Press essay in 2007, said not including Othello in the program announcement was “not good enough … on a communications level, it was a fail”. She said shutdowns caused by the global pandemic – coupled with Queensland Theatre’s prior lack of investment in local Indigenous artists – resulted in the 2021 season having just one First Nations work. “It’s not an excuse, it’s not ideal … but there was simply no First Nations works ready,” she said. Lewis said when she took up her position with the company in January, she consulted widely with the Indigenous arts community. “It became clear we had to build a new pipeline for works by local First Nations artists, and not just buy in shows from other states,” she told the Guardian. “But I knew it wasn’t going to happen overnight. “Then when Covid hit, I made the decision [in consultation with the government] to commit all $650,000 of our commissioning and development funding to First Nations work.” Two Indigenous works are now under way with another two on the drawing board, she said, pending additional funding from independent sources. “But these are works in development for 2022, not 2021, and we can’t start waving them about before they are ready.” On Thursday morning, Lewis met Queensland’s arts minister, Leeanne Enoch – Wesley’s sister – to apologise for “messing up” the company’s communications. Lewis copped a further round of criticism on social media after announcing the Othello production would premiere in Cairns, not Brisbane, seemingly giving the production lesser status. But Lewis told the Guardian the bilingual (Kala Lagaw Ya and English) production was being transported from its 16th century Venetian setting to the Torres Strait Islands during World War II, and would be its first production developed and embedded in the Torres Strait Islander community. “And we are a state company, not a Brisbane company,” she said. The controversy is just the latest in a renewed push for more racial diversity in the Australian arts industry, coming three months after the Rob Guest Endowment delivered a list of “uniformly white” semifinalists for its musical theatre award. The criticisms resulted in the cancellation of the $50,000 scholarship, after the nominees expressed solidarity with their allegedly overlooked peers.",culture

"Going up close to a great work of art, perhaps to Auguste Rodin’s full-height sculpture of a shy Eve, is a rare pleasure in a neighbourhood gallery, especially since opening hours are now restricted by the pandemic. The Southampton City Art Gallery is one of those municipal buildings with perhaps more than its fair share of unexpected treats due to the bequest of a local chemist and businessman called Robert Chipperfield. He died rich in 1911, instructing his legacy to be spent on filling up a new gallery with top-notch pieces like Eve. Just over a decade ago the city considered selling valuable works including its Rodin sculpture, then worth just over £1million, to fund other projects, but the sale was stopped by a petition and a stern warning from the Tate, which had an advisory role. “We believe the sale of works acquired through the Chipperfield bequest to raise funds towards a capital project is not advisable and, indeed, not in the spirit of the bequest,” the Tate ruled back then. Today, in the grip of Covid-19, many galleries, museums and libraries, large and small, national and provincial, are considering making similarly controversial moves. A deep drop in revenue and donations has shaken the foundations of many a neo-classical portico. But should an artwork donated to the public ever be sold off as an asset? Writer Malcolm Gladwell has dared to say “yes” to this divisive question. Looking in particular at the wealthy arts citadels of Manhattan in his podcast Revisionist History in June, Gladwell used the phrase “dragon psychology” to characterise the thinking of the custodians of valuable cultural objects. He explained his argument to the Observer this weekend: “The dragon, in folklore, hoards treasure and virgins, even though he has no romantic interest in women and no desire to show or share or otherwise enjoy his treasure. “Since most major art museums now have upwards of 95% of their collections in storage – where they can’t be shown or shared or otherwise enjoyed – doesn’t that sound like dragon behaviour?” This autumn the Observer reported on the Royal Opera House’s decision to put a David Hockney portrait under the hammer to raise crucial funds, and also on the contentious fate of the Royal Academy of Arts’ famous Taddei Tondo; a marble sculpture by Michelangelo Buonarotti, the sale of which would rescue the institution from financial peril. Several other cultural and educational organisations have put historic objects up for sale after staring grimly at their balance sheets. The Royal College of Physicians was to sell a stack of rare books at Bonhams to deal with a funding shortfall of £3m, but now says it has taken “no firm decisions”. More than 600 of its fellows and members, including a former government chief scientific adviser, Mark Walport, were irate enough to pen an open letter to the president of the college arguing that a sale would represent “a breach of trust between the public, the benefactors and the college through the irreparable damage caused by the transfer of the college’s and the nation’s cultural inheritance into private hands”. In England, the rules about these matters are laid down by the Museums Association’s code of ethics, used to set Arts Council England’s standards, and they state that artefacts “should not normally be regarded as financially negotiable assets”. Last week it emerged the English public school Rugby is to auction a selection of valuable works including a 1632 second edition of A Shakespeare Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies with an estimate of between £20,000 and £30,000 and a first edition Christmas Carol by Dickens from 1843 that is likely to go for £4,000. The online sale at Forum Auctions takes place on Wednesday and does not, the school says, reflect any financial difficulty. Headmaster Peter Green said he simply wants the rare titles to be in specialist hands and added: “The school is committed, as a registered charity, to use its resources to benefit current and future students.” And there is a non-pandemic precedent. In 2018, Rugby made a cool £15m by selling off a collection of old master drawings at Christie’s. It is more difficult to remain sanguine, though, when the very purpose of your organisation is the making and sharing of art. At the Royal Academy of Arts (RA) opinions are split. Many believe retaining Michelangelo’s Tondo is essential to the spirit of the academy, while a smaller group of academicians argue that the work, as a last resort, is less important than the threatened jobs of staff. Certainly selling off the family silver, or “deaccessioning”, as it is known in curatorial circles, is not always judged beyond the pale. Alison Cole, editor of the Art Newspaper and author of a book about Michelangelo’s Tondo, knows it can be done properly.  “It depends how you handle it,” she said. “Tate did it in an exemplary way a few years ago and were open about the process. On the other hand, it would be crazy for the Academy to sell the Tondo, one of the greatest examples of Michelangelo’s work in the country. It would be far too expensive for any other British gallery to buy, so we would lose it. “It is also a work that lays out the artist’s whole process and that seems highly appropriate for an academy.” Writing in the Spectator last month, art critic Martin Gayford was equally unhappy at the idea of the loss of the Tondo: “The RA has sometimes seemed unsure of what to do with it,” he admitted, but concluded: “The rationale, saving jobs and securing the RA’s financial future, is comprehensible. But I suspect that it would be a big mistake.” Over at the Victoria and Albert Museum the feasibility of editing down the collection is perhaps more obvious. Twenty years ago the former director Mark Jones and the late Matthew Evans, then chairman of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, debated how best to deal with the crates and crates of artefacts and design objects held in permanent storage. From this was born the idea of putting the V&A stores on show at a new site in east London, as a kind of behind-the-scenes glimpse. The current director Tristram Hunt says plans for V&A East are on track. “We have all these fantastic items that people will be able to come and see. It shows that with the right kind of thinking you can turn the issue around and make it an attraction in its own right, especially for researchers, without having to sell anything off,” he said. In America, strict guidelines that prevented such sell-offs were lifted this spring. Art collections in Syracuse, Indianapolis, Fort Worth and Laguna Beach, among others, have offered works for sale during a two-year “window” intended to help galleries and museums survive the devastating Covid-19 period. Yet planned sales by the Brooklyn Museum and the Baltimore Museum of Art have provoked widespread protests. In Baltimore two artists on the gallery’s board of trustees resigned and a couple of leading benefactors withdrew support as a result of the agreed sale of Andy Warhol’s Last Supper and two other modern works. The Sotheby’s sale, which was called off with only two hours to go last month, would have raised $65m to spend on re-balancing the museum’s collection in favour of work from more diverse artists. It would also have gone, it was claimed, on improving staff salaries and conservation costs. Art is not for hoarding, argued Baltimore curators Asma Naeem and Katy Siegel: “Museums are not mausoleums or treasure houses, they are living organisms, oriented to the present as well as the past.” In an attempt to clarify the position in America, Brent Benjamin, president of the Association of Art Museum Directors, publicly welcomed Baltimore’s decision. “I am gratified to learn that the Baltimore Museum of Art has decided to reverse course,” he wrote. “As we have said consistently, our April 2020 resolutions were not intended to address needs beyond current, pandemic-related financial challenges.” Yet on the same night, Brooklyn Museum raised almost $20m from the sale of seven works by artists including Henri Matisse, Joan Miró and Claude Monet. The museum in New York had laid off 7% of its staff this summer. “The Monet happens to be lovely but is not one of his great works nor close to the best in our collection,” its director, Anne Pasternak, said. This month the leading international curator Francesco Bonami told ArtNews he believed the current debate might have a silver lining if it persuaded more galleries to focus on improved programming rather than on growth. “I don’t see anything wrong in selling work with a high market value that an institution considers redundant,” he said, adding: “Before a museum decides to sell its collection assets, it should first reduce other often exaggerated costs and maybe cancel a useless expansion.” Like Bonami’s criticisms, Gladwell’s attack on the “dragon psychology” of major cultural institutions is really an attempt to shake up the sheltered complacency they detect. Perhaps, then, it is not too cynical to suggest that some of the controversial high-profile sales of work this year are at least in part designed as public sacrifices that may win over hearts and minds at a time of austerity. Announcing the sale of Hockney’s 1971 Portrait of Sir David Webster, the illustrious former general administrator of the Royal Opera House, Alex Beard, chief executive at Covent Garden, told the Observer he knew it was important to make it clear to government and to potential donors that an institution often regarded as wealthy was willing to feel some real pain. The painting, which had originally been paid for with staff donations, sold at Christie’s for the lower end of its estimate at £11m, or £12.8m with fees. There is speculation that the buyer was David Ross, the founder of Carphone Warehouse, who took over as chair of the opera house this summer. Ross is known to collect Hockneys. Christie’s, however, is protecting the buyer’s anonymity. Art experts now wonder whether the art market will soon be flooded and sale values pushed down. But this looks unlikely in Britain, where museum ownership still adds lustre to the provenance of a lot. A more pressing danger is that future visitors to Britain’s smaller galleries will have fewer chances to bump into the life-size work of a renowned artist like Rodin.",culture
"As of Tuesday evening, Donald Trump, predictably, refused to concede the presidential election, a defiance of the democratic process echoed on Fox News, the same network that declared Joe Biden the winner, along with every other network. “So which one is it?” Trevor Noah joked on Tuesday’s Daily Show. “It’s like when your dog wants to play fetch, but then refuses to let go of the ball. “And whether these people believe what they’re saying or they’re just pretending to believe it, it’s terrifying either way,” Noah continued. “But regardless, it’s not surprising.” It’s not surprising that the president’s “ride-or-die” Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson are backing his unsubstantiated attempts to discredit the election, Noah added. “What is a bigger deal, is that Republicans with actual power,” such as Senators Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell; the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; and the attorney general, William Barr, “are also throwing their weight behind Trump’s election challenges”. By Tuesday, both McConnell and Graham had spoken publicly in favor of Trump’s baseless, distracting accusations of voter fraud, while Pompeo remarked at a press conference that there would be a “smooth transition” to the second Trump administration. “The truth of the matter is, most other Republicans know that Joe Biden will be the next president,” Noah explained. “And right now, they’re just saying what Trump and his base want to hear, not because they’re worried about the vote that just happened, but because of the one that’s around the corner” – the two Senate run-off contests in Georgia to be held on 5 January, which will determine narrow control of the Senate. In other words, “Trump is screaming made-up shit that’s weakening trust in American democracy, but Republicans are going along with it so that they can squeeze out a few more seats in the Senate,” Noah concluded. “That’s like burning down your house just to make s’mores. Or dating Kevin Federline just you can maybe meet Britney Spears. Is it worth it?” “Oh what a strange and troubling world some people would like this to be,” a somber Stephen Colbert said on Tuesday evening. Just one night before, the Late Show host poured champagne to toast the incoming Biden administration; 24 hours later, Colbert shattered the bottle. “I will cut you if you come near me, because there’s some crazy shit going on out there!” he joked. “On Monday, our soon-to-be former president, citing baseless charges of non-existent fraud, instructed government leaders to block cooperation with President-elect Biden’s transition team,” Colbert explained. And “after being non-committal about the whole president-for-life thing”, McConnell claimed before Congress that American institutions were “actually built for” Trump’s baseless protestations of the election: “We have the system in place to consider concerns, and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.” “All he’s saying is that yes, people are concerned about that stick of dynamite, but the president is fully within his legal rights to light the fuse,” Colbert mocked. “Scissors are in place to cut the fuse if it gets too close, OK? Great, who’s got the scissors? Oh wait, we gave them to the president – I’m sure he’ll do the right thing.” On Monday, the party line extended to the justice department, as Barr discarded decades of precedent in staying out of electiosn with a memo that authorized federal prosecutors to investigate “substantial allegations” of voter fraud before the results of the presidential election are certified. “So federal officials are now planning to intervene in our election at the request of their leader. That also has a bit of an international feel, doesn’t it?” said an incensed Colbert. “During Covid, this is the closest we’re gonna get to an overseas vacation – ‘Wow, such a fascinating country. Ooh, I’m going to drink coffee in little cups, order a croissant, poop standing up and just enjoy the coup d’etat.’” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel stewed over America’s “Potus [who] refuses to go-tus”, as Trump still denied the results of the election. “Are we sure Donald Trump isn’t just stuck in a White House bathtub and too embarrassed to call for help?” Kimmel wondered. “A reality show host who will not accept reality.” “How pleased with himself is Vladimir Putin right now?” Kimmel later said, joking that the Russian president’s investment in election interference in 2016 was akin to hitting “the Destroy America lotto”. More seriously, Kimmel explained that he was “less disgusted with our toddler-in-chief throwing his oatmeal at the wall than I am with the Republican congress-people who are going along with this. “The baby’s right!” he added, mocking the GOP. “That oatmeal should go on the wall! He’s within his rights to throw it on the wall. We need to let the process of oatmeal-slinging play out.’”",culture
"It’s been nine months since America went into lockdown, but there’s finally a light at the end of the tunnel, said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show, as Britain inoculated its first citizen against the coronavirus. “Now that Britain has the vaccine, Americans are asking the American questions, like ‘give it to me,’” Colbert explained. But it might be longer yet until Americans are vaccinated en masse, as it was revealed this week that the Trump administration passed on securing additional doses of the Pfizer vaccine now being distributed in Britain. “It’s leadership like that, that will ensure the president will continue to lose the election,” Colbert joked. “It’s all laid out in the new book, The Art of Why Didn’t You Make the Damn Deal?!” Trump attempted to counter the embarrassing story on Tuesday with a White House vaccine summit (skipped by the two leading vaccine companies, Moderna and Pfizer) in which he bragged about the administration’s Operation Warp Speed and signed an executive order proclaiming that other nations will not get the US supplies of its vaccine until Americans have been inoculated. The order is moot, since the US will probably be the country short on vaccines; it appears to have “no real teeth”, according to the New York Times, “and it’s signed by a man who has no real hair or brain”, added Colbert. Trump also promised, without evidence, that Covid infection rates in the US will “skyrocket downward”. “Ah, yes, that classic symbol of success: a rocket in the sky, plummeting toward the ground,” Colbert deadpanned. “It’s like they say: shoot for the moon – if you miss, you will die alone in a frozen metal tube.” Meanwhile, the president once again tried to overturn the election with two phone calls to the Republican speaker of Pennsylvania’s house of representatives, days after he pressured Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp to convene a special legislative session to override the state’s election results (Kemp declined). “Come on, man, at a certain point you have to understand that it is over!” Colbert implored. “There’s a reason you don’t see headstones that say, ‘I’d like a second opinion!’ “It’s horrifying, but at this point, no one should be surprised,” the host continued. “Say what you will, but at least the president called. It’s so much more personal than destroying democracy by text.” “Donald Trump knows what he’s getting his loved ones for Christmas this year, assuming he’s capable of love,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night, as the president reportedly considered handing out pardons “like Christmas gifts” during his final days in office. One source told Axios that Trump offended a staff member by pre-emptively assuming they would like a pardon, even though the official had not committed any crimes. “The big question is: will Trump be allowed to pardon himself?” Kimmel explained. “He must think so because he’s still trying to put the squeeze on state officials” with two phone calls this week pressuring Pennsylvania’s speaker of the house to invalidate Joe Biden’s victory in the state. “This is where we are as a country right now – our president is cold-calling state representatives asking them to throw the election his way, like it’s a beauty pageant or something,” Kimmel lamented. In other news, Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis tested positive for coronavirus days after she attended the White House Christmas party on Friday sans mask. The diagnosis has reportedly angered some senior Trump officials who were also in attendance. “Well, why were they at the party?” Kimmel wondered. “Why did you have a party in the first place?” It’s all a bit ironic, given that just months ago, Ellis tweeted “there is no pandemic” – “so I’m starting to think the virus may have a sense of humor about all this,” Kimmel quipped. And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah blasted Trump’s handling of the Pfizer vaccine deal, which offered the US doses now allotted to other countries after the administration punted on the deal. “That’s the art of the deal right there, baby,” Noah mocked. “Pfizer thought that they could pull a fast one on Trump by offering to sell him life-saving vaccines, but my man Trump was like, ‘no deal. So now, Europe is stuck with all those vaccines, and that means more corona for everyone here in America, baby! Wait … “Seriously though, this may seem like it was a dumb decision by Trump,” Noah added. “But if you take a moment to think about it, you realize that it was a really fucking dumb decision by Trump.”",culture

Glyndebourne (nr Lewes, 20 May to 29 August) kicks things off with six productions, three of which – including Kát’a Kabanová – are brand new. Garsington, Longborough and The Grange follow. AC An A-list jazz quartetSaxophonist Joshua Redman, pianist Brad Mehldau, bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade’s 1994 debut was all too brief – because they were all on the verge of their own starry careers. This year they reunite (Barbican, EC2, 11 July) with their compelling RoundAgain album. JF Brilliant black historyThe black cinema renaissance continues. This month sees Regina King’s One Night in Miami (15 January, Amazon Prime Video), bringing together Cassius Clay, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown, and new doc MLK/FBI (15 January). The theme continues through Lee Daniels’ The United States vs Billie Holiday (12 March), and Judas and the Black Messiah with Daniel Kaluuya as Black Panthers chairman Fred Hampton. Making a song and dance of itStage-tested musicals are coming to a screen near you, including drag-teen smash Everybody’s Talking About Jamie (26 February), Lin-Manuel Miranda’s pre-Hamilton In the Heights (30 July) and Spielberg’s West Side Story (10 December). Miranda also scores the animated Vivo (about a music-loving monkey), while Camila Cabello is a singing Cinderella (5 February), and biopic subjects include Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Super new superheroesOver the Avengers? Don’t worry: this year promises a cornucopia of fresh comic-book characters to perk up the genre. A new phase of Marvel movies brings kung-fu master Shang-Chi (9 July) and the godlike Eternals (including Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Richard Madden and Kumail Nanjani (5 November). DC has The Suicide Squad (6 August), with Margot Robbie, Idris Elba and Peter Capaldi, and there is Jared Leto’s antihero Morbius (19 March). Do call it a comebackWe’ve had so many undercooked revivals in recent years, but we refuse to learn. Don’t pretend you’re not excited to see familiar faces such as Keanu Reeves’s Neo, back for a fourth Matrix instalment (22 December). Or 80s survivors such as Tom Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick (2 July) and Eddie Murphy’s Coming 2 America (5 March), or even the goofball Space Jam: A New Legacy (16 July), with LeBron James this time. Also back are the high priests of refusing to grow up: the Jackass crew. Just going to the cinemaWe’ve done the experiment, and can conclude that horrors are scarier, comedies funnier, dramas more dramatic, and movies just better when we’re experiencing them together on a big screen. We’ll be so happy when cinemas properly reopen, even the things that used to annoy us will be gratefully received: aren’t these lava-coated nachos delicious? Feel free to take the arm rest! Forgot to turn off your phone? That’s fine! SR Art festivals are set to make a comebackThere is real urgency to the cutting-edge arts festivals this year. Set to reignite creative vim in recently emptied urban centres far beyond London are the five-yearly state-of-the-nation survey The British Art Show (6 March to 4 September), visiting Wolverhampton, Plymouth, Aberdeen and Manchester; the Liverpool Biennial (20 March to 6 June); and Glasgow International (11 to 27 June). Blockbuster showsThis year’s hottest tickets include the father of modern sculpture Auguste Rodin’s works in plaster, which give free rein to his experimental impulses (Tate Modern, SE1, 29 April to 31 October); a major retrospective of Paula Rego’s satirical paintings tackling hard-hitting subjects from fascism to abortion (Tate Britain, SW1, 16 June to 24 October); and Albrecht Dürer’s work, traced through his travels in Europe (The National Gallery, WC1, 6 March to 13 June). Art responds to Black Lives MatterIncreasingly diverse programming includes Black Arts Movement leading light Lubaina Himid’s witty theatrical tableaux (Tate Modern, SE1, 25 November to 22 May 2022) and Michael Armitage’s subversive east African dreamscapes (Royal Academy of Arts, W1, 13 March to 6 June). The surrealist photographer Eileen Agar (Whitechapel Gallery, E1, 10 February to 23 May) and abstract painter Sophie Taeuber-Arp (Tate Modern, SE1, 15 July to 17 October) are the latest undersung women getting their dues in the reappraised pantheon. Creativity on south-east shoresEstuary 2021 (22 May to 13 June) will see artists mining the overlooked industrial sites, nature reserves and landmarks that dot the Thames as it winds through Essex and north Kent. Meanwhile, for Creative Coast, south-east art spaces have worked together to devise site-specific works on watersides from Gravesend to Eastbourne (from 14 May). All shall have top prizesRecent iterations of the UK’s big art prizes – the international Artes Mundi (various venues, Cardiff, 13 February to 6 June) and the UK-focused Turner prize (Herbert Art Gallery & Museum, Coventry, 29 September to 12 January 2022) have been turned on their heads. Winners have either shared the prize money with other contenders, or the judges awarded everyone. With solidarity upstaging competition, expect more reinvention of the format this year. SS Romeos and JulietsIt is a year of sweet sorrow with three bold new takes on Shakespeare’s star-crossed romance. The National Theatre has converted its Lyttelton stage into a temporary film studio for a TV version, starring Jessie Buckley and Josh O’Connor, which airs in spring. Dear Evan Hansen’s Sam Tutty joins Emily Redpath in a new film shot with isolated actors using green screen. And choreographer Rosie Kay transfers the tragedy to Brum’s black and south-Asian communities (Birmingham Hippodrome, 17 March). Puppet masteryThis summer sees a huge street party thrown for a nine-year-old refugee. Her name’s Little Amal, she will have travelled all the way from the Turkish-Syrian border and, oh yes, she’s a 3.5 metre-tall puppet created by the War Horse team. Symbolising millions of displaced children, the puppet will go on an “epic theatrical journey” through Europe en route to Manchester international festival (4 July). New venues open upClosures dominated 2020 but a handful of brave venues will open their doors in 2021. Liverpool’s PurpleDoor promises stories about local lives, with all performances free. Reading Rep turns an old Salvation Army building into a theatre. In London, the Arcola hosts a festival in its new outdoor space, and Woolwich Works is a new arts destination by the Thames. Sing when you’re winningAfter all those Covid-safe monologues and pared-back productions, a chorus line of musicals is waiting to explode on to the stage: Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella, Broadway hit Frozen, Back to the Future, The Drifters Girl with Beverley Knight, Monsoon Wedding, Strictly Ballroom, Get Up Stand Up! The Bob Marley Musical and the return of Hairspray are all worth making a song and dance about. Worldwide wondersLockdown has led to a boom in interactive digital experiences: a hybrid form that is its own thing entirely. The Big Tiny, Exit Productions, Swamp Motel, Coney and Fast Familiar are all making participatory stories that feel distinctly theatrical. Les Enfants Terribles’ Sherlock Holmes adventure The Case of the Hung Parliament (27 January to 17 February) is just one to investigate in 2021. CW Magic and monstersPostponed premieres are itching to finally get on stage, and there is a touch of the supernatural afoot. Akram Khan’s Creature (Sadler’s Wells, EC1, 23 September to 2 October), for English National Ballet, is inspired by Shelley’s Frankenstein while, on the lighter side, Drew McOnie brings Merlin back to life for Northern Ballet. Another fairytale show, BalletLorent’s The Lost Happy Endings (Sadler’s Wells, EC1, 2 & 3 April), should at last get its chance to tour. Embracing digital For a long time, dance on film was seen as a poor relation to stage. But 2020 forced a reconsideration, and choreographers have enjoyed reaching audiences beyond the confines of the theatre. Expect more in 2021 as Sadler’s Wells starts the year with a livestreamed festival, Dancing Nation (28 January, BBC iPlayer), featuring performances from Natalia Osipova, Matthew Bourne’s New Adventures and new companies to watch: Matsena Productions and Humanhood. LW  The non-Zoom-based comedy fest is back One by one, they fell: Melbourne, Brighton, Machynlleth, then – gasp – Edinburgh, too. But if 2020 was an endless winter, the thaw starts from February, when the UK’s second-biggest such event, Leicester comedy festival (3 to 21 February), returns to the stage. Will the fringe follow suit? We can only hope. The rise and rise of the standup specialWe missed live comedy in 2020, but there was no shortage of onscreen standup. There will be more in 2021, as YouTube, NextUp and Amazon Prime Video shake their spoons hungrily at Netflix’s standup pie. The latter has struck a deal with live comedy hotspot Soho Theatre for two series of specials. 2020s heroes finally take to the stage In a year without live performance, comedy’s brightest new talents had to find other ways to make their name. Enter viral Room Next Door star Michael Spicer, say, or Britain’s Got Talent breakouts Jon Courtenay and Nabil Abdulrashid. Assuming that we return to a degree of normality, all will embark on their maiden UK tours in 2021. BL The year the PS5 and Series X consoles take offThe new consoles have not yet been tested, but 2021 will bring games that really push those powerful graphical engines. PlayStation 5 gets Gran Turismo 7, the latest title in its acclaimed driving sim series, and sci-fi adventure Horizon Forbidden West, while Xbox boasts shooter epic Halo Infinite and Everwild, the latest genre-defying quest from Sea of Thieves creator Rare.Retromania galoreFor such a tech-focused industry, video games sure do love the past. And 2021 will see not one but three nostalgic hardware launches: Intellivision Amico (15 April), which revives the 40-year-old console; Playdate, a handheld games machine with a wind-up handle; and the gorgeous Analogue Pocket, which looks like an iPhone but runs thousands of Game Boy and Game Boy Advance titles.The year of dark futures It is not surprising given the state of the world, but this year sees a lot of big new games about dystopian futures. Assassin shooter Deathloop (21 May), spooky apocalypse actioner Ghostwire: Tokyo and the psychological horror Returnal (19 March) are all intriguing games about terrible things to come. Then there’s Gotham Knights, a Batman game set – wait for it – after the death of Batman. Cheer up, it might never happen. KS",culture
"It appears the mute button is becoming harder to find these days. Hollywood is now rallying its support for an actor who posted a video of an excruciatingly awkward Zoom encounter he had with a director who witheringly criticized his “tiny apartment” without realizing he hadn’t muted his microphone. Lukas Gage, best known for his role on HBO’s Euphoria, posted a video on Twitter yesterday of him preparing for an audition over Zoom. “Psa if you’re a shit-talking director make sure to mute ur shit on zoom meetings,” Gage wrote when posting the video. At the start of the clip, which has racked up more than 4m views, Gage is fixing his hair when a voice with a British accent quips: “These poor people live in these tiny apartments like I’m looking at his, you know, background and he’s got his TV and his, you know …” Gage, smiling, tells the director: “I know it’s a shitty apartment. That’s why give me this job so I can get a better one.” When the director apologizes, Gage adds: “I’m living in a four-by-four box, it’s fine, just give me the job and we’ll be fine.”  “I’m mortified,” the director says as someone starts to laugh in the background. The identity of the director is unknown, but Gage has received unanimous support from colleagues in Hollywood for how he handled the encounter. “Classy response Lukas,” wrote the actor January Jones in an Instagram comment. “DM me who it was so I can make note not to ever work with that person.” The actor Kevin McHale thanked Gage on Twitter for posting the clip. “Actors have to walk out on the plank and be open and vulnerable in an audition and too often the people on the other side have zero regard for what it takes and how personal it is,” he wrote. “As a young man I would have dreamed of an apartment like this one. Look at that sweet flat screen! A guitar! The moldings!” the director Judd Apatow wrote on Twitter.",culture
"Substack is best known as the newsletter platform that lured several well-known writers and journalists away from established news outlets this year. Glenn Greenwald, Matthew Yglesias and Andrew Sullivan, formerly of the Intercept, Vox Media and New York Magazine respectively, have all jumped ship to sell their work directly to subscribers via the service. Incorporating elements of Mailchimp and Patreon, Substack has variously been hailed as the future of the media industry, a home for writers who don’t want to be edited, and a place where those who have already made a name for themselves find success. The site boasts more than 100,000 niche newsletters about every subject imaginable. Below is a small selection of some of the best, compiled from the recommendations of friends, colleagues, random tweets and my own sleuthing. Note: not all Substacks require payment – some are free, while others offer a mix of free and paid content. Insight is the creation of Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and author who writes about how technology “interacts with the fabric of society” for the Atlantic and the New York Times. Her first Substack missive was an astute analysis of why the tradition of televised debates between presidential candidates in US elections is no longer fit for purpose – particularly in the era of Donald Trump – due to “cultural lag”: Later instalments explore why randomised trials could not prove mask-wearing was effective in preventing Covid-19 transmission, mistrust in elections and the trade-offs in deciding how and when people are vaccinated. All of it is good. If you prefer lighter newsletter fare, Guardian Australia’s culture editor, Steph Harmon, recommends Ryan Broderick’s newsletter Garbage Day. “He does these deep dives into new memes and viral happenings, investigates the origins and evolution of old ones, and scans across all other matters of weird online ephemera, if you’re into that sort of thing, which I am, very much,” she says. Here’s a snippet from a recent newsletter in which Broderick dives into, among other things, extremist internet communities that have begun leaving mainstream social networks such as Reddit: I know almost nothing about the ¡Hola Papi! Substack beyond a single post I came across via Twitter, but it was a post of such perfection that I am recommending it wholesale. (¡Hola Papi! says it started out as an advice column at Grindr’s LGBTQ outlet INTO in 2017 and is being turned into a memoir to be published by Simon & Schuster next year.) The post in question is titled “Top 5 Rat Movies I Made Up” and it’s written by John Paul Brammer, who is the brains behind ¡Hola Papi!. Brammer canvasses “the nonexistent rat movies in my head based on the Rotten Tomatoes score I’m pretty sure they would have gotten if they’d been executed faithfully to my vision”. Please enjoy this excerpt: My friend Josh Nicholas is an NBA tragic and in the interests of branching out beyond my own narrow interests, I present you with one of his favourite Substacks: Truehoop. “Truehoop is one of the original sports blogs, and writer Henry Abbott has seemingly met everyone,” Josh says. “Little anecdotes puncture his stories, reminding you that behind the NBA’s plays, glamour and stats are real people and some weird situations. One week it’s an exploration into a team owner’s alleged mob ties, another it’s the problem with a basketball shoe marketing machine that is largely aimed at poor communities. There has never been more incredible sports writing being published, and Truehoop itself surfaces a lot of it, but I don’t know of anyone else that so consistently shows sports isn’t just about sports.” Here’s a small taste of The sneaker industry paradox: Before Letters of Note was a Substack it was a blog, a book (or two) and a live show, but the concept is the same. As writer Shaun Usher explains, it’s basically a bunch of emails in which he chats about letters. I’ve been a longtime fan because I, too, love letters. Here’s an excerpt of a letter Virginia Woolf wrote to Violet Dickinson on 28 December 1906: The moral of this story is that Substack is full of great stuff and if you don’t like anything I included in my list, you could probably find something on it that you do.",culture
"Are the bad guys winning? For a hellish moment that felt like the situation in both reality and pop culture. Never mind a harried hero defusing a nuclear bomb at the last second; in the age of Mindhunter, audiences are apparently more interested in analysing what makes evil-doers tick. You see it in Angelina Jolie’s ravishingly wicked Maleficent movies, or TV deep dives into knotty psychologies like Hannibal, Ratched or the soon-to-be-revived Dexter. It has become so normalised that Lucifer – the actual devil! – gets to headline his own slick, self-satisfied procedural.  In this morally complex landscape where we all seem to be reassessing what it means to be “good” or “evil”, reducing a villain to a random shopping list of character traits and cliches might feel like something of a step backwards. But until film and TV production is safely back up and running, this random bad guy generator is probably the best you are going to get. Just select a random six-digit sequence of numbers from one to six, then run that personalised doomsday code through the generator to create a memorable foe.

"The creators of the show Hedwig and the Angry Inch have weighed in to a casting row that led to the producers of an upcoming Australian production pulling the show from January’s Sydney festival. In a statement on Wednesday, John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Task said they did not believe the title role was a trans character, and the role should be “open to anyone who can tackle it and, more importantly, anyone who needs it.” The January festival announced the postponement of rock musical and seminal queer show on Tuesday, following a flood of complaints over the casting of a cis male as Hedwig. The Packed to the Rafters actor Hugh Sheridan was announced to be playing the complex genderqueer character in early November. Sheridan, who revealed in October that he has been with men and women but eschews labels when it comes to sexual orientation, was to become the latest in a long line of queer cis men to play the role, including its creator Mitchell. The actor who launched a petition that led to Sydney festival’s cancellation of Hedwig and the Angry Inch spoke out on Wednesday about why they believe “it’s time to make change happen” when it comes to casting transgender roles. Since launching a social media campaign on Monday, Daya Czepanski has collected more than 1,700 signatories expressing the transgender community’s “profound sadness and disappointment” over the casting of “a cisgender male as a transgender character”. “[This] is offensive and damaging to the trans community, and continues to cause genuine distress and frustration amongst trans and gender non conforming performers all across Australia,” the open letter posted on Instagram said. It called on the show’s producer and the Sydney festival to “rectify this casting choice” by casting a transgender actor in the title role, employing “trans advocates on the [Sydney festival] creative team”, and including “trans advisors and talent” in the Hedwig production. Czepanski, a 2018 NIDA graduate who identifies as trans non-binary and recently established the Queer Artist Alliance, told Guardian Australia on Wednesday that the intention behind the campaign was not to scuttle the show. “It’s not about cancel culture,” Czepanski said, from their Covid-19 quarantine hotel in Christchurch, New Zealand. “It’s just about bringing an awareness that systemic change needs to happen from the ground up, and if we can fix the root cause of the problem we can work towards a healthy environment for non-cis trans artists. “People in positions of power in Australia need to take a leap of faith and allow trans, non binary and gender queer to tell their stories on the Australian stage. “I don’t have all the clear answers; it’s a developing conversation, but it’s a conversation that needs to happen,” they continued. “It’s time to make change happen, and we can’t use the past as an excuse to not make that change.” On Tuesday, the Sydney festival director, Wesley Enoch, was notified by the show’s producer David M Hawkins of his decision to postpone the production. Hawkins then released a statement saying “in light of recent community conversations and concerns, we have made the difficult decision to postpone” the Sydney festival season of the show.  He went on to say the production had “auditioned a wide, diverse range of performers”, and no one from any background had been excluded from the auditioning process. “We wish to assure the trans and LGBTQIA+ community that the issues raised are respected and taken very seriously,” the statement said, adding that the producers needed more time to “properly consider these concerns and respond accordingly”. The Sydney festival confirmed the show’s postponement on Twitter, saying it supported the producer’s decision.  “Sydney festival is an important platform, and we have a responsibility to use this platform in a way that is beneficial to all members of the community,” the post said. “We also recognise our responsibility to actively address concerns that are not in alignment with out values.” Both Hawkins and the festival declined to elaborate further on Wednesday. Sheridan has been approached for comment via his agent.  The show’s creators have always maintained that because Hedwig does not freely choose a trans life – she is coerced into a sex change operation as part of a plan to escape East Berlin – the role does not have to be played by a trans actor. “Though we’ve always been so pleased to hear trans folks find resonance in the character’s journey to find his/herself, it’s really through drag and performance that Hedwig does so, creating a persona that is ‘more than a woman or a man’ and making ‘something beautiful and new’ out of trauma,” they said in the statement on Wednesday. “Drag is a mask available to all and that’s why anyone should be able to play Hedwig.” “Hedwig was forced into kind of an accidental trans state by political and by patriarchal pressures,” Mitchell told Buzzfeed in 2018. “I’ve seen trans people [play] it, I’ve seen female people do it … the feelings and the ideas are more important than the attributes of the person playing it physically or age-wise.” On Tuesday the Hungry Ghosts actor Suzy Wrong – a signatory to the petition – told Melbourne’s LGBTQI+ community radio station JOY 94.9 that while the postponement of the production may have represented an “overcorrection”, the petition was an overdue challenge to the accepted norm – of more than two decades – that a cis gay man was the most logical choice when casting the character. “We are in a different time now, and we are trying to find a way to have these discussions,” she said. “At the moment, everything is a lightning rod ... every time there’s a mis-step it becomes a lightning rod and trans people, trans performers, trans artists like myself, we will take the opportunity to attack it and say ‘let’s have this conversation now’ and ‘I’ll tell you why it is wrong’.”",culture
"“It’s been five days since it became clear that Joe Biden won the election,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show, “at which point the current president refused to concede, duct-taped himself to the resolute desk and slapped a sign on the Oval Office door that says ‘No Dems Aloud.’” Over a week since the polls closed, and days since all major American networks, including Trump’s beloved Fox News, declared Joe Biden the next president of the United States, Donald Trump has still refused to concede the election. “He’s like a toddler too hopped up on sugar to go to bed,” Colbert joked. “There’s no reasoning with him at this point, you just have to let him tire himself out, wait until he falls asleep on the kitchen floor and hope he hasn’t conspired with the dog to stage a coup.” While Trump’s refusal to acknowledge his defeat has material consequences for the Biden transition team, the president-elect’s staff is not too concerned about the Trump campaign’s efforts to undermine the results, reportedly viewing its PR and legal efforts as a “comedy of errors”. “Yes, it’s just like Shakespeare,” Colbert deadpanned. “The president’s fraud claims are much ado about nothing, because he’s pulling out these accusations of fraud right out of his Coriolanus.” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee celebrated Biden’s victory, but warned that Trump and his base are far from over and done. “While it will be nice to see the Secret Service drag Trump out of office, the president is leaving behind a wave of white resentment and disinformation,” she said. “Plus, out of spite, Trump is probably gonna upper-deck all the toilets in the West Wing.” “As much as we’d like to think that a Biden presidency will instantly solve America’s problems, Trump will still exist and so will the base he fired up,” she added. “He’s also leaving enough filet-o-fish wrappers on the White House lawn that kids can jump in them like a pile of majestic autumn leaves.” “Trump’s more ardent supporters are mad as hell and they aren’t going away,” Bee said, pointing to protests in several swing states in which Trump supporters chanted both “stop the count!” in Philadelphia and “count the votes!” in Arizona. Trump isn’t going anywhere, either – “he is an ageing, bitter, fame-hungry personality who craves the spotlight more than anything,” Bee explained. “The best we can hope for is that he’ll go on Dancing with the Stars and get lifted by his partner with so much force it shoots him into space.” Still, “there’s a lot to celebrate right now,” she concluded. “We have a chance to reverse four years of an administration that ruled with cruelty, deceit and dangerous misinformation. But we have to stay vigilant, because Trumpism isn’t going away any time soon.” “It has now been four – or possibly 12? – days since Joe Biden was declared president-elect and Kamala Harris’s sassy white friend,” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show, and yet America’s “tenant-from-hell”, Donald Trump, still had not conceded the election – a choice Joe Biden called an “embarrassment” that “will not help the president’s legacy” in a speech on Monday. “Joe Biden is right,” Noah said. “Does Donald Trump really want denying the election results to be his legacy? Because I’d like to remember him as the president who kidnapped kids and helped kill 240,000 Americans, not for this. “Everyone around Trump knows he lost, but they’ve gotta all go along with the lie,” Noah added of reports that Trump had instructed his staff to prepare a budget and interview new hires for a non-existent second term. “That’s got to be exhausting, especially when you’re already running a fever from Covid.” Biden was also right, Noah continued, in that Trump’s refusal to concede amounted to an embarrassment. “Donald Trump has never looked more pathetic than this, and yes I’m including the time he played tennis in his sport diapers,” Noah said. “Because the only way he could overturn the election is to prove that there has been nationwide voter fraud, and the truth is that’s just not panning out,” as no issues of substantive or widespread voter fraud have been reported. The New York Times and AP called election officials in every state; none reported any cases of widespread voter fraud. In other words, “everyone knows Donald Trump lost. Even Trump knows that he lost,” said Noah. How did he know? Because Trump hasn’t been seen in public since Saturday, when Biden was declared the winner. “You think that if Donald Trump really thought he’d won he’d be hiding? No. We know this guy,” said Noah. “This guy would be holding a victory rally every single day. He’d be flying around the country on top of Air Force One doing that weird jerk-off dance that he does.”",culture
"Just before her appointment as the new director and CEO of the Australian Museum became public knowledge in 2014, Kim McKay sat anonymously in the Sydney museum’s cafe drinking coffee. “It was just inside the building’s main entrance, and I remember thinking, the first thing that hits people when they come inside [the museum] is the overwhelming smell of greasy hot chips,” she says. “I thought to myself, ‘Oh my god, all this has to change ... everything is so worn, and I’m going to fix it.’” On Saturday, after a 15-month major facelift, the Australian Museum will reopen its doors to the public. The transformation of the 193 year-old building is what McKay calls her long-running labour of love, turning a cluttered and chaotic series of cramped spaces, groaning under the weight of past architectural and interior design crimes, into a sleek, light-filled institution aesthetically displaying a carefully curated fraction of the museum’s enormous collection. More than 3,000sq metres of new public space has been added in the process. Even the new cloakroom is a design triumph, the walls of the formerly dank basement pared back and scrubbed clean to their original creamy sandstone, hand-hewn by convicts almost 200 years ago. The project, which closed the museum last August, comes with a $57.5m price tag. Uncovering and restoring the vast building’s heritage sandstone bones cost $3m alone. The New South Wales government stumped up $50m and the museum raised the remainder, largely through the courting of philanthropists, who are acknowledged in the naming of the museum’s two largest new spaces – the Hintze Hall (the Hintze Family Charitable Foundation) and the Brian Sherman Crystal Hall. Sydney-based arts doyens Brian and Gene Sherman donated $1m to the rejuvenation project. The cafe McKay made her vows in six years ago has been demolished, and a sleek new eatery has been installed on the building’s rooftop. But the chips have remained stubbornly on the menu. On Saturday, McKay will tick off another item on the to-do list she created upon her appointment six years ago. When the museum opens its doors, the public will enter free of charge. And that, she says, is “a real game-changer”. To make the plan financially viable, the museum sent its most successful major exhibitions packing: Spiders – Alive and Deadly exhibition has generated revenue of $1.5m while touring through the US and Canada over the past three years; Tyrannosaurs – Meet the Family has earned $2.5m during its five year tour across North America. The latter has returned home to become the new-look museum’s first special ticketed exhibition. The enduring fascination with dinosaurs by children and adults alike has much to do with their fantasy-as-fact appeal, says Matthew McCurry, the museum’s vertebrate palaeontologist and functional morphologist. “People are excited by dragons, they are excited by aliens in outer space … but the difference with dinosaurs is that yes, they part of another world but this stuff is real. “We have the bones, we can look for evidence and build this understanding of what that world that looked like that was so different from today.”",culture
"Naaman, I have often dreamed of amassing obscene wealth with a minimum of labour or talent. Are my dreams likely to remain unfulfilled? Hi Stuart. You have two options – buy a house 10 to 20 years ago in Sydney, or grab a rod and catch one very special fish. Under a (not confirmed) new proposal designed to boost tourism, an alliance of Sydney harbourside businesses are thinking of starting a fishing competition along that iconic shore. One kingfish will be released into Sydney Harbour and tagged with a million-dollar reward. If you catch it, the money is yours. Other fish will be released with smaller prizes of $5,000 and $10,000. The million dollar fish is only one idea, floated as part of a new “Sydney Harbour festival”, and designed by the Western Harbour Alliance. The chairman of the alliance, Geoff Parmenter, said: “These kind of events can really kickstart Sydney’s recovery from the Covid pandemic.” Is there a chance that the fish, once released, will swim away and never be seen again? I’d say yes. Fish famously have no respect for the rules and conditions of NSW tourism campaigns. Our wealthy piscine could simply scarper, with its $1m tag still attached, and maybe live out the rest of its life on some tropical island. In fact, the Northern Territory government has run a nearly-identical million dollar fish campaign – called Million Dollar Fish. Over five years, that million dollar fish has never been caught. A spokesman for the Western Harbour Alliance told Guardian Australia: “It is unlikely that the fish would be kept in a certain area. It may indeed, therefore, leave the harbour.” Won’t that $1m be missed? Hopefully not. The plan is that this event will generate more revenue for the state than will be lost through the catching of the fish. The fish hunt is also only one event in a broader plan for a harbour festival. Sydney’s Daily Telegraph reported glowingly that “it is hoped the festival would rival Vivid, which attracts 3 million visitors and generates $172m a year, or Sculpture by the Sea, which attracts 450,000 visitors and pumps $40m into the economy.” A second Daily Telegraph article on the same fish hunt said that organisers expected it to generate $7m – but a Western Harbour Alliance spokesman said this was an error. They’re not willing to put a number on this yet. It’s not my job to judge whether 3 million visitors and $172m is a realistic aim for a primarily fish-based festival, but hey, you have to consider it. Especially if our million-dollar fish is never caught. Think of the profit margin! Is there a risk that, once the fish is released, hordes of Sydneysiders will descend on the area and begin flinging explosives into the ocean in an attempt to make their fortune? Organisers told Guardian Australia that “very preliminary target audiences” are “set indicatively” at 100,000. But that includes people visiting sculpture and art installations and food stalls as well. “Estimates of participation in each element, including the fishing, would be made as part of detailed event planning, should the event be progressed,” a spokesman said. However, once it dethrones Vivid, I would definitely be worried. Prepare for a Simpsons-esque city-wide scramble to secure Molloy the cat burglar’s treasure. But isn’t this irresponsible? Don’t we need as many fish in the sea as possible? A spokesman for the Western Harbour Alliance assured me that “sustainability and safety would be key planks of the event”. That is again, only in the event that “the event be progressed”. So please put away that dynamite-loaded lure of yours and get back to earning excessive amounts of money the traditional way – consulting.",culture
"Three weeks clear of the election and with the formal transition of power finally underway, Seth Meyers looked ahead to calmer news cycles of the future on Monday night. “One thing I’m definitely not going to miss about the Trump era is the Mad-libs style news reporting,” the Late Night host said. “Another thing I won’t miss is trying to follow the rotating cast of fringe rightwing weirdos who come in and out of the Trump world,” such as the conspiracy-peddling figures on the Trump legal team led by Rudy Giuliani. Last week, the former mayor of New York City held a press conference in Philadelphia peddling lies about voter fraud while dark droplets – seemingly brown hair dye mixed with sweat – dripped from his temples. “Rudy dyed his hair frantically in a bathroom like Richard Kimball in The Fugitive,” Meyers joked. “I mean, if I saw that coming out of my radiator I would be pounding on my super’s door.” Giuliani and his team are “the only people Trump has left, because no legitimate lawyer wants to be part of this unhinged assault on American democracy”, Meyers continued, pointing to reports that most of Trump’s legal team has quit. “At this point, the Trump legal team is like CVS at midnight – sure, they’re ‘open,’ but nobody actually works there.” Meyers zeroed in on one especially fringe figure: Sidney Powell, “by far the craziest addition to the Trump Cinematic Universe,” a lawyer who spent the weekend floating a truly unhinged conspiracy theory that involved Georgia governor and Trump ally Brian Kemp, the CIA, and Venezuela’s deceased president, Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013, in a plot against the president. “If you thought Rudy was bonkers, this lady is crazier than a cereal mascot,” Meyers said. Her theories sans any evidence spooked even the president’s staunchest allies on Fox News, who pressed her with questions when she promised, as she said on Lou Dobbs’s show, to “release the Kraken”. “I guess the only Kraken we ended up seeing was in Rudy Giuliani’s hair dye,” Meyers retorted. “They have no evidence, which is why lawyers keep quitting or getting fired or laughed out of court, because this whole thing isn’t actually about evidence. It’s about manufacturing a conspiracy theory that will animate Trump’s base for years to come. It’s just another scam.” The Late Show taped just after Emily Murphy, head of the General Services Administration, “ascertained” the election result and initiated the formal transition process to President-elect Joe Biden. “So it is official, our next commander in chief will be President Biden,” said Stephen Colbert. “Which means somewhere right now, Rudy Giuliani is filing a last ditch legal claim that our current president’s legal name has always been Joe Biden.” In another blow to Trump’s disintegrating attempt to overturn the election results, Georgia officials completed a hand recount of the entire state to confirm that Joe Biden won – “so the president saw the writing on the wall, and graciously…asked Georgia for another recount,” Colbert deadpanned. “He wants them to recount the recount? Mr President, things don’t necessarily get better when you ask for a do-over. Look at Eric.” Colbert also touched on the president’s attempt to distance himself from Powell, whose conspiracy theories on Trump’s election loss were outrageous enough to merit skepticism from Fox News host and reliable Trump conspiracy peddler Tucker Carlson. Even Giuliani attempted to distance himself from Powell, releasing a statement claiming “Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own” and that she is “not a member of the Trump Legal Team”. “Yes, she doesn’t work for them at all, it’s just a coincidence that during Giuliani’s two-hour press conference, she was on stage the entire time,” Colbert said, with photo evidence. “It’s a simple mix-up! They invited Sidney Powell but they meant to invite Sidney Powell Total Landscaping.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the twentieth day of “Squattergate,” in which “we still haven’t seen the president concede. We’ve barely even seen the president.” The president once again had no public events on Monday – “just some eating and some private screaming into a MyPillow” on the docket, Kimmel joked – after a weekend of golf. Still, “I’ve never seen a guy try so hard to keep a job he doesn’t even do,” Kimmel said, as on Friday, Trump “tried to interfere in the election personally” by inviting Michigan’s Senate majority leader and speaker of the House, both Republicans, to the White House for some “bigly buttering up”. The plying didn’t work; on Monday, Michigan’s board of canvassers certified the state’s election result, once again confirming Joe Biden as the nation’s 46th president. Kimmel also touched on Powell and her fear-mongering that Kemp was bribed by a voting machine company to throw the election to the Biden. “I guess that was too much even for Donald Trump, because a week after he welcomed Sidney Powell to what he described as a ‘truly great legal team,’ the campaign put out a statement saying ‘Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own,’” Kimmel explained. “It’s a real CrackerJack team of attorneys he put together here, in that he appears to actually have found them in boxes of CrackerJacks.”",culture
"The ska-era Wailers launch themselves into the 60s Jamaican vogue for singles either praising or condemning the violent Kingston “rude boy” youth cult. Tellingly, given the socio-political songs that lay ahead of him, Marley focuses on the deprived circumstances that birthed the phenomenon: “Want it want it – can’t get it, get it get it – no want it.” Selassie Is the Chapel is like nothing else Marley recorded, in effect a doo-wop song given a Rastafarian twist. It is set to a lo-fi backing consisting of noticeably out-of-tune guitar and drums, which only serves to make the Wailers’ high harmonies more powerful. It’s both faintly creepy and fabulous. Marley was not initially convinced by punk, but eventually recognised the denizens of the Roxy as kindred spirits – “rejected by society” – and threw in his lot on the exuberant Punky Reggae Party, which namechecks the Clash and the Damned and promises “no boring old farts will be there” at the titular event. There’s something genuinely thrilling about the way Exodus’s opening track slowly creeps into view – it takes a full 30 seconds to fade in – and something chilling about its mood, the lyrical references to Revelation and insistence that “many more will have to suffer, many more will have to die”. Producer Chris Blackwell might have sweetened their sound for white ears, but you could never accuse the Wailers themselves of sugaring their message. Exhibit A: Catch a Fire opener Concrete Jungle’s powerfully bleak reportage, allegedly written not about Kingston’s ghettoes, but Marley’s mid-60s stay in the US. The Wailers were always musically open-minded – in the 60s they covered everything from Bacharach and David to the Archies’ Sugar Sugar, while 1971’s Lick Samba dabbled in Latin-American music. Could You Be Loved?, meanwhile, allied Marley’s sharp pop instinct to disco, with backing vocalists the I-Threes on particularly fine form. Marley’s pre-Island discography can be baffling – umpteen releases, umpteen labels – but the 00s box sets Fy-ah Fy-ah, Man to Man and Grooving Kingston 12 do a good job of sorting through it, revealing gems such as Caution: an odd, tremulous lead guitar, eerie harmonies on the chorus and a winning refrain of “hit me from the top, you crazy mother-funky”. Marley’s great musical inspiration was Curtis Mayfield – the young Wailers even copied the Impressions’ poses in photos. It’s tempting to call Johnny Was his answer to Mayfield’s Freddie’s Dead: an empathic examination of an accidental death (“from a stray bullet”) that nevertheless has wider implications, the lushness of the harmonies at odds with the lyrics. Smile Jamaica was the theme song for the Kingston concert that almost got Marley killed – he was shot by gunmen two days before the gig. It’s tempting to suggest the track itself is oddly prescient: despite the title, there’s something brooding and overcast about its sound, as if Marley didn’t quite have faith in the sentiment the lyrics were supposed to be espousing. Recorded at the first Wailers session following Marley’s return to Jamaica from his mid-60s sojourn in America, Freedom Time is audibly influenced by the music he heard in the US – there’s a distinct hint of the Impressions’ civil rights anthem People Get Ready about the lyric – and a total delight: piano-led rocksteady with a beautiful descending melody. As stark and potent as late 70s Marley got, War dispenses with standard verse-chorus structure and any semblance of lyrical poetry. The music exists as an austere backdrop for words taken from a Haile Selassie speech: “Until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned, everywhere is war.” Marley recorded several versions of One Love – it began life as a ska track in 1965 – but the version on Exodus, interpolated with People Get Ready, is definitive. Its contemporary role as jolly soundtrack to umpteen Jamaican tourist ads overlooks the fire and brimstone aspect of the lyrics. Usually taken as a metaphorical song about colonialism, there seems every chance that the defiant Small Axe was, at heart, actually about the Wailers’ perennially volatile relationship with the Jamaican music industry. The re-recording on Burnin’ beats the Lee Perry original – slightly slower, with lovely backing vocals courtesy of Peter Tosh. Of all the tracks the Wailers cut with Perry in the early 70s, the title track of their December 1970 album feels the most forward-looking. It would be a brilliant song however it was produced, but its bass-heavy sound makes it feel like something from far later in the decade. His 1979 LP Survival was Marley’s most politically militant statement, its preoccupation with pan-Africanism reflected not just in the lyrics of Top Rankin’ (“They don’t want to see us unite … all they want us to do is keep killing one another”) but its sound: the horns carry more than a hint of Fela Kuti about them. Marley frequently reworked old material during the 70s, but the version of Sun Is Shining (a song apparently inspired by Eleanor Rigby, of all things) on 1978’s Kaya is dwarfed by the 1971 version produced by Perry: minimal, bass-heavy, gloomier-sounding than the lyric suggests, with Tosh’s melodica snaking around Marley’s voice. Jamming is Marley at his most genial and pop-facing, but the music that underpins the charming tune is surprisingly tough. Check out the instrumental and dub versions appended to the deluxe edition of Exodus for proof of what a fantastic rhythm section the Wailers boasted. After the departure of Tosh and Bunny Wailer, Marley came out swinging on 1974’s Natty Dread. Any fears the Wailers might be diminished were dispelled by the simmering tension of Them Belly Full, its invocation to “forget your troubles and dance” tempered by its ominous warning: “A hungry mob is an angry mob.” Co-written by Perry, Duppy Conqueror’s Louie Louie-esque groove seems to commemorate producer Joe Higgs’s unique method of curing the Wailers’ stage fright by making them rehearse in graveyards. “If you’re not afraid fe sing fe duppy [ghosts],” explained Wailer, “the audience can’t frighten you.” The high, shivering vocal interjections add a suitably uncanny ambience. Natty Dread’s opening track is a reggae equivalent of Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay: a chest-out espousal of the genre’s virtues that seems aimed, as much as at anyone, at the white audience Island Records was trying to bring to Marley. The incredible audience-assisted version on 1975’s Live! feels like a mutual explosion of glee. A lot of Exodus tended to the mellow, but the strength of its title track comes from a relentless urgency. Exodus is built around a riff that stays the same for the best part of eight minutes. Its final 60 seconds are the nearest the 70s Wailers albums got to dub. Slave Driver and Tosh’s superb 400 Years are the toughest moments on Catch a Fire. “Every time I hear a crack of a whip, my blood runs cold,” sings Marley, capturing the song’s emotional temperature. For all its rage, it is icy too – with a sense of certainty that “the table is turned” and its targets are in hell. Leaving aside the intriguing question of how Marley got his wife, Rita, to sing backing vocals on a song about his mistress Cindy Breakspeare, Turn Your Lights Down Low is an exquisite love song. Hovering somewhere between reggae and a soul ballad, its melody is gorgeous, while the slide guitar and – yes – the backing vocals are beautifully done. Eric Clapton’s hit cover drew greater attention to Marley as a songwriter, but its slick funk isn’t a patch on the Wailers’ cop-baiting original, lacking its falsetto vocals, reedy organ line and the terrific breakdown with its echoing vocal – “If I am guilty I must pay!” – and funk-inspired clavinet. Kaya is by some distance the least well-regarded of Marley’s 70s albums, a lightweight filling sandwiched between hit-packed Exodus and the fiery Survival, but its big hit is irresistible, evidence of one of Marley’s less exalted skills, as a masterful pop craftsman piling one fantastic melodic hook on top of the other. Blessed with one of the all-time great opening lines – “One good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain” – the original Perry-produced Trenchtown Rock was one of 24 singles the Wailers released in 1971. Its elated shout-out to the Kingston neighbourhood that gave birth to reggae stayed in Marley’s live set for the rest of his career. Rita has suggested Marley knew he was dying when he recorded Uprising; certainly, its closing track provided his musical epitaph. There’s a full band version of Redemption Song, but it has none of the acoustic take’s raw impact. Closer to folk than reggae, alternately brooding and exultant, it remains moving despite its subsequent omnipresence. Gorgeous evidence both of the debt the Wailers owed American soul music and that Blackwell’s controversial decision to overdub Catch a Fire’s tracks using UK and US session musicians yielded dividends. John Bundrick’s synth is a perfect addition to the stunning, airy harmonies, augmenting the song’s heavy-lidded, blissful, post-coital mood. As with John Lennon, canonisation has done Marley few favours. Rather than the benign patron saint of potheads and beach bars represented by the trite but wildly popular Three Little Birds, it’s better to remember him as the co-author of Get Up Stand Up, a militant, righteously pissed off call to arms that has lost none of its urgency. People who saw the Wailers’ 1975 shows at the Lyceum in London talk about them in awed terms: the subsequent live album suggests they’re right. The studio version of No Woman No Cry is fine, but the live take – longer, slower, sadder, the drum machine replaced by Carlton Barrett’s astonishing playing – elevates the song. It’s a raw recording by modern standards (a bum note of feedback rings out at 1min 47sec), but from the moment the audience take up the chorus’s refrain before the band do, it feels luminous and utterly magical, the intensity of its emotional twists and turns – from melancholy nostalgia to optimism – potentiated.",culture
"The national embarrassment Jimmy Kimmel has termed “Squattergate” – Donald Trump’s refusal to acknowledge Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election and facilitate the transition of power – sputtered along on Tuesday evening, the day before the deadline for the Trump campaign to request a recount in Wisconsin. The recount for a state Biden won by over 20,000 votes would cost the Trump campaign $8m, “which is why he’s asking his supporters for $16m – a little walking around money on the side,” Kimmel joked. “The only way Wisconsin is getting $8m from Donald Trump is if it has sex with him 63 times.” Meanwhile, “the president’s minions are working hard right now to poison the well,” Kimmel continued, such as the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who, in a phone call over the weekend, pressured Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to throw out legally cast ballots in certain counties, according to Raffensperger. Graham is “one of many Republicans who still refuse to acknowledge publicly that Joe Biden won the election”, Kimmel explained. “Behind the scenes, though, it’s a different story.” On the Senate floor on Tuesday, Graham gave a congratulatory fist bump and pat to Kamala Harris. “It’s almost as if Lindsey Graham is an unscrupulous opportunist who blows whichever way the wind goes.” Finally, Biden reportedly told advisers this week that he doesn’t want his presidency consumed by investigations into Trump’s corruption. “Which is big of him,” said Kimmel, “but what about what I want? I at least want a mugshot out of this. I want to see Trump in a jumpsuit that matches his skin.” “Two weeks to the day since the election and I’m beginning to breathe easier,” said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show. “It’s like I’ve had this weight lifted off my chest. Doctors say it was 239lb, but it sure felt heavier.” Meanwhile, in Washington, “the president is slowly, agonizingly going through the five stages of narcissistic grief: denial, denial, denial, denial, denial and denial. I know that’s six, but Rudy [Giuliani] is demanding a recount.” The denial continues even as the Trump campaign’s legal strategy against the election falls apart, with cases dropped this week in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin. “To be clear: ‘dropped.’ Those are withdrawn cases. They didn’t even lose them – they pre-lost them. That’s like coming in last in the Indy 500 because you decided not to buy a car.” And on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah condemned the Trump administration’s reckless messaging on gatherings for Thanksgiving as cases surge and hospitals across the nation prepare to be overrun, if they’re not overstretched already. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist who somehow serves as Trump’s adviser on infectious diseases, told Fox News isolation of the elderly should outweigh Covid concerns for large, intergenerational groups – “for many people, this is their final Thanksgiving, believe it or not,” Atlas said. “I think we have to have a policy, which I have been advocating, which is a whole person, whole health policy.” “This dude can’t be serious,” said Noah. “‘For many people this will be their final Thanksgiving?’ I mean, yes, thanks to the Trump administration, there’s definitely going to be many people’s final Thanksgiving, but still. “If you get corona, that’s the ‘whole’ thing,” he added. “It’s not like you’re gonna say ‘well, I died of Covid, but damn those mashed potatoes were great.’” While it’s of course important for people to see their families, Noah continued, “it’s more important to be able to see you family for the next 10 Thanksgivings – they’ll hopefully get to be with you in person after all of this is done. “It’s so hilarious that conservatives have ended up here,” he added. “Because when this pandemic started, you remember, they said ‘we don’t need to shut down the economy, just be safe and responsible.’ Then they were like ‘we don’t have to wear masks to protect the elderly.’ Now they’re like ‘you know what, bring the elderly in here, I can’t fit all those leftovers in my fridge.’” The shifting, groundless messaging “just doesn’t make sense”, Noah concluded. “It doesn’t make sense why Trump is willing to risk old people being exposed to corona this much – unless he thinks that it will end up making him look good in the long run, because you won’t have old people dying if all the old people are already dead.”",culture
"Michael, Scottie, Dennis, Phil and Steve. Like the members of a new, wildly popular boyband, these names are permanently etched in my mind after viewing the Netflix sports docuseries The Last Dance. Despite complete ignorance of anything remotely to do with sports and only newly sentient at the age of three when the events of the series take place, the Michael Jordan-produced show has proved to be one of the most addictive viewing experiences of the year, channelling the fast-paced unpredictability of basketball, launching a thousand memes and provoking high-profile backlash from some of those featured – as well as a spate of new fashion inspirations. Telling the story of Jordan’s final season with the seemingly unbeatable Chicago Bulls from 1997 to 98, intercut with footage of his rapid ascension to become one of the greatest players of the American sport in the across the previous decade, the show’s premise is deceptively simple. With Jordan granted editorial control, it initially seems an egocentric hagiography on his part, a retelling of the well-trodden story of a lone hero, battling against all odds to become the champion of his chosen pursuit. Yet, from the very first shot – of present-day Jordan looking like a much-loved sofa cushion slumped in an armchair, red-eyed and permanently flanked by a tumbler of whisky – The Last Dance gives away far more than its producer had perhaps hoped. The kinetic editing – cutting back and forth between the 97/98 season, Jordan’s early career and contemporary analysis – soon highlights his own contradictions. Here is a man who fashioned himself into one of the archetypal sporting leaders, and yet he is also so fiercely competitive as to pursue rivalries to the potential detriment of his team – punching teammate Steve Kerr in practice, for instance, or refusing to intercede when key player Scottie Pippen leaves in protest at his comparatively pitiful pay. What soon becomes apparent is that Jordan might be sociopathically bent on winning at any cost, but it is a price his team is willing to pay to be able to bask in his success. It is a revealing exposition of the competitive psyche. And it isn’t as if his teammates aren’t obscenely talented too, but Jordan is so gifted and relentless that no one can hope to compare – they are the mere firmament to his central, blazing sun. The joy of The Last Dance lies in the fact that an entire follow-up could be made about Jordan’s teammates: kindly, determined Kerr, enduring baritone Pippen, heartfelt eccentric Dennis Rodman and shamanic coach Phil Jackson. Not to mention, reams of sartorial analysis on Jordan’s constantly ballooning square suits and gold hoops, Rodman’s mercurial hair and under-appreciated haute couture dressing, even Jackson’s painfully high-waisted trousers. Despite cracks in Jordan’s self-presentation allowing the fraught realities of his leadership to shine through, there are still omissions. His personal life, including a worrying fixation on gambling and a highly publicised divorce, are scrupulously avoided. And this is clearly a man’s world; leaving Jordan to feel compelled to play immediately after the murder of his father and Kerr’s inability to emotionally connect with his captain when his own father was killed. In a year full of soapy sports docuseries, such as All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur and The Test, serving as advertising as much as anything else, the distance of hindsight allows The Last Dance to be more about its people than its brands. As the thousands of hours of edited-down court-side footage shows, this is an unrelenting, adrenalised sport and in The Last Dance we witness its intoxicating effect on the players, as well as its lasting consequences after the glamour of victory has faded. Then we are left with Michael, Scottie, Dennis, Phil and Steve, older now, all chuckling at their bygone antics but still revealing their deep-seated need for recognition, to be considered the greatest.",culture
"A quick experiment: Anthony Hopkins is one of history’s most celebrated thesps, a star of stage and screen for more than 60 years. Picture him. What do you see? Is it John Quincy Adams in Amistad? Frederick Treves in The Elephant Man? Or is it Hannibal Lecter, leering through plexiglass, theth-theth-thething into the camera? If you said it’s anything other than that last one, then congratulations. Why not pour yourself a nice glass of chianti to wash down your LIES. Of course it was Lecter. That is no slight on those other roles, either. Nor is it an insult to Javier Bardem to posit that he’ll for ever be the coin-tossing, mop-headed wrong ’un from No Country for Old Men. And Kathy Bates is a phenomenal actor, but even she must be aware that she hasn’t met anyone for 30 years who didn’t, at some point in the conversation, calculate how far she was from the nearest hammer. These actors are exceptional at what they do, yet it was that same brilliance in these roles (for which each of them won an Oscar) that turned Lecter, Anton Chigurh and Misery’s Annie Wilkes into such inescapable, career-defining figures. The real Hopkins, Bardem and Bates almost seemed like their final victims.  Why these characters in particular? Brian Cox played Lecter in Michael Mann’s Manhunter in 1986, five years before Anthony Hopkins’s adroit wine pairing for human liver in The Silence of the Lambs. Yet Hopkins’s interpretation lives on, ever-quotably, in the common consciousness. Cox’s Succession stablemate Matthew Macfadyen played the Sheriff of Nottingham in Ridley Scott’s Robin Hood. Is it Macfadyen you think of when you imagine the sheriff? Of course not. The sheriff is a lithe Alan Rickman, threatening to remove someone’s heart with a spoon, and it always will be. You might argue this is because Scott’s Robin Hood wasn’t very good. But rewatch Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and you’ll find that, besides Rickman, it’s appalling. These actors’ synonymy with villainy may appear to be an alchemic, almost accidental intersection between the perfect actor and role, but it isn’t as serendipitous as it appears. Hopkins played Lecter three times, presumably on purpose. Rickman alone is responsible for not one, not two, but three of the great baddies: the sheriff, Harry Potter’s Snape and Die Hard’s Hans Gruber. It is a deliberate, more-is-more approach pioneered by Boris Karloff in the 30s then perfected by the mighty Christopher Lee, who would cheerfully ham it up as the big evil in the majority of his 260-odd (!) films, including 10 (!!) appearances at Dracula, as well as Saruman in The Lord of the Rings, and as Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. Through a chimera of tone of voice, fortuitous evil-faced physiognomy and sheer gung-ho enthusiasm, some actors excel at playing villains, and clearly have a ball doing it. It cannot be typecasting if the actors are typecasting themselves. They also get the meatiest, showiest roles. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger’s Jokers won Oscars. Christoph Waltz bagged one for Inglourious Basterds. Louise Fletcher won best actress in 1976 as Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Daniel Day-Lewis for There Will Be Blood, Mo’Nique for Precious, JK Simmons in Whiplash, Charlize Theron in Monster – all winners. Villains are critical darlings every inch as much as they are fan favourites. Most actors say it is much more fun playing the knave than the hero, so it’s easy to see why Lena Headey created one of TV’s great monsters in Game of Thrones’ Cersei Lannister, but also stole 2012’s Dredd as the joyously psychopathic drug kingpin Ma-Ma Madrigal. Anything in which Jason Isaacs plays a right bastard – Potter, The OA, The Patriot – is essential viewing. Gary Oldman, Helena Bonham Carter, Ruth Wilson: if they are playing a baddie in something, people will watch it for no other reason. There’s such an embarrassment of larks and accolades in being bad it’s a wonder anyone strives to be good. An actor doesn’t have to be born with a permanent sneer and an arched brow, either. Robin Williams made a chilling nasty in Insomnia and One Hour Photo. Denzel Washington is spellbinding as the unhinged bent copper in Training Day. America’s sweetheart Meryl Streep was a next-level sod in The Devil Wears Prada. David Tennant’s ascent to full-blown national treasure has been assured by a post-Doctor volte face in which he has played every manner of swine, from Dennis Nilsen to Jessica Jones’s gaslighter general Kilgrave. And the sooner Tom Cruise abandons his midlife crisis, accepts he’s creepy AF and gets back to the Magnolias, Interview With the Vampires and Collaterals to which he’s far more suited, the better. Heroes are fine, but they come and go, more or less interchangeably: Arnie begat Bruce who begat Will Smith who begat Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Those few actors lucky enough to play ne’er-do-wells know this: that it is great villains who linger, who sink their claws into us, needle away at our subconscious, delighting and disgusting us decade after decade. Perhaps they don’t want to change. They’re not trapped at all by their God-given bastardry. They’re freed by it. Only by being bad can they get to be this good, and they love it. And who can blame them? Bwa-ha-ha-ha-haaaaaa.",culture
"Ottobah Cugoano, an 18th-century anti-slavery campaigner who wrote the most radical abolitionist text of its time, has become the earliest black figure to receive a blue plaque. The plaque on a building in Pall Mall, central London, aims to shine light on the remarkable and little-known story of a man described by the historian David Olusoga as a “true pioneer … the first African to demand the total abolition of slavery and one of the leaders of Georgian London’s black community.” It follows cold case reviews of black and minority ethnic figures from history by an English Heritage working group tasked with getting more diverse representation in the scheme. Cugoano was born near the coast of present-day Ghana where he was kidnapped in 1770 by slave traders. He was only 13, later writing: “I was early snatched away from my native country, with about 18 or 20 more boys and girls, as we were playing in a field … Some of us attempted, in vain, to run away, but pistols and cutlasses were soon introduced, threatening, that if we offered to stir, we should all lie dead on the spot.” He was forced on to a ship heading for the West Indies where he was sold to plantation owners in Grenada. After two years he became a servant to a prominent slave-owner and was taken to England where he was baptised, now 16, as John Stuart. At some point he gained his freedom and by the mid-1780s he was employed as a servant to the fashionable painters Richard and Maria Cosway, working at their grand residence, Schomberg House, where the plaque celebrating Cugoano has now been placed. A self-portrait etching by Cosway depicts him and his wife seated in their garden being fed grapes by Cugoano, dressed in crimson silk in imitation of footmen at the Vatican. It was while living at Schomberg House that Cugoano wrote the book Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Humbly Submitted to the Inhabitants of Great Britain. It was one of the first black authored anti-slavery books to be published in Britain and is regarded as the most radical in its arguments. Cugoano took on the reasoning used by apologists for slavery, that Africans were complicit in the trade, by inviting readers to imagine slave raids on Britain by African pirates “assisted by some of your own insidious neighbours, for there may be some men even among you vile enough to do such a thing if they could get money by it.” He advanced the view that “the difference of colour and complexion, which it hath pleased God to appoint among men, are no more unbecoming than the different shades of the rainbow are unseemly to the whole … It does not alter the nature or quality of a man, whether he wears a black or white coat – whether he puts it on or strips it off, he is still the same man.” Schomberg House was mentioned on the frontispiece as one of the places the book could be obtained, suggesting that the Cosways supported Cugoano. Olusoga, a member of English Heritage’s blue plaques panel, said: “Ottobah Cugoano was a remarkable man, one who himself had known the horrors of slavery.

Only 4% of the 950 blue plaques across London are dedicated to black and Asian figures from history, a figure Olusoga has called “unacceptably low”. English Heritage said it could be partly explained by the relatively low number of public nominations fulfilling the blue plaque criteria and “by the all too frequent lack of historic records to establish a definitive link between the person in question and the building in which they lived.”",culture
"What did you spend lockdown doing? If it was anything like my lockdown, it involved live-streaming DJs, bands and theatre and live, intimate performances by solo musicians from their bedrooms. I’ve caught up on a lot of books I might otherwise have claimed I was too busy to read. So it’s thanks to art and artists that I’ve found more reason for hope and excitement the past few months than I have found reasons for grief. The very nature of artists is to investigate, question and express something essential of the mood of the world – or just their world. And through this period, musicians, artists, dancers, choreographers, writers, games developers and everyone with a creative outlet has continuing to work, to create, to innovate and to share their creative talents under immense financial and emotional pressure. Take singer-songwriter and violinist Xani Kolac, who lost months of work on a stage production when shutdown kicked off in Australia in March. Since then she’s has been performing on Twitch TV and Instagram Live, her sequinned costumes and the unpredictable, joyful nature of her social media streams a glistening bubble of hope on days when I felt like I was existing in a vacuum. Will she be dancing wildly today, or riffing on the loops her fans have sent in for an improv jazz session? Playing violin or singing? She’s been a pandemic panacea for me. In lockdown, I walked a lot. From Collingwood, my dog and I walked through Fitzroy Gardens to the city. Normally, I’d never try to manoeuvre a small, excitable, furry creature through streets that would ordinarily still resemble John Brack’s famous painting, Collins St, 5p.m. But in the quiet, we walked to the NGV and admired its formidable water wall and empty forecourt. We walked through Federation Square and past the Australian Centre for Moving Image, Birrarung Marr, the Arts Centre and the Forum theatre, too. All these beautiful Melbourne places of performance, noise, talent, unity and the sacred act of making and sharing our stories … empty. Later, I watched a performance by the Australian Ballet, who screened some of their most beloved classical works online for free, including my favourite, Giselle. Giselle is the story of a peasant maid who falls in love with a philandering count. She goes mad at the end of the first act, appearing to her lover as a wili – a ghostly apparition – during the second. The ghostly Giselle dances with her lover throughout the night, still in love with him despite his betrayal, before vanishing at dawn. Watching the ballet under lockdown, I felt an unexpected sympathy with Giselle – not for the love of another person but for the city, and that sense of being banished to some ghostly, half-realm. Giselle, in its bittersweet romantic loveliness, at that moment echoed for me the melancholic air of longing for the outdoors, the bustle, the noise, the safety of the life we knew only yesterday. I had enjoyed visiting theatres, galleries, cinemas and music performances up until the doors closed in March, but not as much as I could have. I suspect I’m far from alone in taking Melbourne’s arts venues and artists for granted. I imagined, like Giselle’s ghostly apparition dancing tirelessly in the dark, silent hours, that those buildings in the centre of Melbourne were not really silent, the energy of storytellers past and future keeping them abuzz beyond our human senses. So even in the darkest of times during lockdown, I found hope. Even as their incomes dwindled and freedoms were curtailed, so many artists have sought unlikely collaborations or outlets for their work. They have been vulnerable and candid and provided their audiences with the licence to admit to their own mental health battles. What they have not done is ceased to create, to share their work and themselves. Let’s not forget how much our mental and spiritual health was buoyed by books, music, design, podcasts, dance and online theatre during lockdown, and channel our gratitude into ticket sales and funding support to keep the arts dancing infinitely.",culture
"My friend Steve Sykes, who has died aged 70 after a stroke, was the dynamic and inspiring chair of the annual Holmfirth arts festival in West Yorkshire. He steered the organisation with imagination and pragmatism, developing the artistic and, crucially, the financial side of the festival. His eclectic and adventurous creative spirit made him a valued leader who inspired a large group of volunteers. A talented guitarist and pianist – latterly adding tenor sax and banjo to his repertoire – he played in numerous local bands for 55 years, often for ceilidhs and community dance projects. Steve was equally at home playing a rock classic or a French chanson or helping to run a therapeutic music session in a care home. For the past 24 years he had been a central member of FEB, a group that plays rock, jazz, folk and music for theatre. He also worked extensively with Xylosound, a band for adults with additional needs. Making music was central to his life; his guitar was never far away. During lockdown he organised a socially distanced FEB recording in his garden for a CD to raise money for Dementia UK. Very much a facilitator, and an advocate for overseas development, he once arranged to send one of his guitars to a teacher also called Stephen he had met while travelling in Zimbabwe, who could not afford his own. They shared a name, the same birthday and, eventually, a guitar. Born in Honley, West Yorkshire, to Leonard, the manager of Rock Mills Textiles in Brockholes, and Hilda (nee Bates), a housewife, Steve attended Holme Valley grammar school, where he met Lesley Hollingworth, whom he married in 1972. When he left school, he went to worked at ICI in Huddersfield before choosing to study colour chemistry at Bradford University. After graduation, he drove cranes at a graphite factory in Sheffield and worked on the construction of the M62, although – as he often said – he had some help with this task. The budgie-breeding aviary he built at the age of 11 was the first of a lifetime of “projects”; later he kept chickens, grew vegetables, and combined his understanding of the natural world with a passion for construction. He taught the sciences, first at Brooke school in Sheffield, later at Mirfield free grammar as senior teacher/acting deputy and, finally, at Shelley college, where he relished returning to a teaching role. His retirement in 2010 gave him the opportunity to create more huts, shelters, greenhouses and spaces for convivial gatherings at his home, as well as enabling his huge involvement in the arts festival. Steve was a generous friend. The arts festival will be dedicating an annual commission in his memory. He is survived by Lesley, their children, Joe and Ellen, their grandchildren, Ren and Maya, and his brother, Keith.",culture
"Griffith University’s art school, the Queensland College of Art (QCA), has announced it will scrap its bachelor of photography – part of broader cuts at the university which will see 144 positions axed across all faculties. The school that counts Venice Biennale artist Tracey Moffatt among its alumni announced the decision late on Wednesday, along with confirmation that the bachelor of creative and interactive media would go as well. The news comes just three weeks after the Australian Centre for Photography in Sydney announced it was closing its doors after 46 years of operation. It follows a string of tertiary institutions taking the razor to their fine arts and performing arts faculties, including the ANU’s School of Art and Design, the University of Newcastle’s major in theatre and Monash University’s Centre for Theatre and Performance. The cuts at QCA mean the loss of 10 full-time positions – about 30% of its staff, not all academic – as part of a broader restructure by Griffith University. It follows a $700m predicted shortfall in revenue over the next five years, due to the loss of international students. . The two degrees cut from QCA are among a dozen removed from Griffith University faculties under the restructure. The university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Carolyn Evans, described Wednesday’s decision – which followed a four-week consultation period – as “one of the most challenging days in [Griffith University’s] history”. “I am very conscious that every person who is impacted will have families, mortgages and other commitments, and this will be a very distressing time for them,” she said in a statement. The QCA Students, Alumni & Community Support Group had attracted almost 12,000 signatories to its Save Our Staff and Studios petition. Group spokesperson Kathleen O’Hagan, a third-year fine art student, told the Guardian that while students and staff were relieved that a handful of jobs slated to go had now been saved – including at the school’s printmaking, jewellery and small objects studios – the eradication of the photography and creative media degrees would have far-reaching consequences. “At the QCA we’re really interdisciplinary, so if you cut a leg off, and take away the teachers and the software that teach practical handmade skills, it’s the whole community that bleeds,” she said. The National Tertiary Education Union told Guardian Australian the University’s cuts were unnecessary and short-sighted. “There are other places the university could have gone to make up the predicted shortfall [in revenue], which is a short-term pain,” said Michael McNally, the union’s Queensland division secretary. “They could have further deferred their massive capital works program. “To make job cuts at this time of the year, when some faculties are reporting higher enrolments [in 2021] than this time last year, shows a lack of caring.” The decision follows the Australian National University’s School of Art & Design proposed funding cuts, announced in November, that will terminate courses in furniture-making, jewellery and objects to counteract the school’s $3.5m deficit. In the performing arts, the University of Newcastle’s major in theatre has been suspended for 2021, while Monash University in Melbourne has scrapped its theatre program completely. In July, the University of NSW announced the merger of its art and design faculty into the built environment and arts and social sciences faculties. The universities have invariably attributed the cuts to the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting loss of international students, which contributed $10bn in fees to Australian tertiary institutions in 2019. The National Association for the Visual Arts’ acting CEO, Penelope Benton, said she believed universities’ fine arts faculties were taking a disproportionate hit in the Covid-19 crunch. “The deficits that universities are showing aren’t that different [from other sectors] ... and they really do not need to make such drastic cuts,” she told the Guardian. “It is looking like many of the universities are looking very simply at their spreadsheets and saying, ‘OK, studios take up that much space and what, you’ve only got 30 students doing that? It doesn’t make any sense real estate-wise when we’ve got these other lecture theatres that can fit 200 students in’.” Benton said the wider messaging from the federal government over universities’ role in turning out job-ready graduates had not helped. In June, the education minister, Dan Tehan, announced that the future student contribution for a three-year humanities degree would more than double – from $20,400 to $43,500. “I think universities have a legitimate fear that there could be less people applying for and enrolling in humanities degrees in the future, just because of the cost,” she said. “That’s a huge part of it, but not all of it. Throughout this year, we’ve heard language from the federal government that the arts are non-essential and this has had a tremendous impact. “To hear that kind of language is quite demoralising. Universities are picking up on that ‘non-essential arts’ message and making budget decisions with this in mind. “The impact has been huge.”",culture
"Since Covid-19 restrictions began to ease around Australia, musicians and live music aficionados have noticed apparent discrepancies in permitted events.  Sporting matches have jampacked mega-stadiums while live music gigs have languished in 25% or less audience capacity under restrictive physical distancing rules. “I was thinking we could start classifying events like this as football matches,” pop artist Jack River told the physically distanced crowd at the Great Southern Nights concert at Sydney’s Qudos Bank arena on 28 November. “Gladys, sort it out.” River was referring to the fact that back in August, the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, gave the go ahead for the NRL grand final at the ANZ Stadium to achieve 50% capacity in the outdoor venue capable of seating more than 80,000 people. The Great Southern Nights gig on the other hand was restricted to 25% capacity – later lifted to just under 30% through an exemption by the NSW government. River hasn’t been the only artist to raise questions. “Did the music community get lost in the numbers game?” the industry magazine Industry Observer asked after 30,000 people flooded the Gabba in Queensland for the AFL grand final in October, followed by 50,000 football fans pouring into Suncorp Stadium for the State of Origin decider in November. Singer-songwriter Amy Shark, rock band Powderfinger and the Church guitarist Ian Haug also see a double-standard. “Is there a magical reason that differentiates how Covid is spread between rugby fans and music fans?” asked electronic duo Peking Duk. Are their concerns justified? Or is it a bit more complicated? The issue is, on the face of it, a simple numbers game about how many people you can pack into a confined space without risking a further wave of of the virus, regardless of whether that crowd is cheering on a football team or a rock band. But only to a point. Take NSW, where the rules depend largely on whether a venue is classified as an indoor or outdoor stadium. NSW’s indoor-outdoor rules explain why the NRL grand final at the ANZ stadium – which is classified as outdoor – was allowed to reach 50% capacity under the previous restrictions, while the Great Southern Nights concert at the Qudos Bank arena – considered indoor – was capped at 25%. As of December, NSW outdoor entertainment venues, be they for sporting or cultural pursuits, can have 100% capacity for fixed seating, and indoor major recreation facilities can sell tickets for only 75% seating capacity. If a music promoter was confident it could sell 83,500 tickets to the outdoor ANZ Stadium, there would be nothing preventing the concert from going ahead at full capacity. And this is what the Australian promoter of next year’s Guns N’Roses tour, TEG Dainty, has done, placing 83,500 ticket on sale for its 14 November concert at the venue. But the 75% rule applies to Qudos Bank Arena, which has capacity for only 21,000 people. The Sydney Kings versus Illawarra Hawks basketball game there on 20 December will have fewer than 16,000 attending. It is outside the outdoor major recreation facilities framework where the NSW rules start to appear erratic. “Most live music events happen outside a stadium context – from large parks to vineyards,” Live Performance Australia’s chief executive Evelyn Richardson said.  “It’s just not cost-effective for most [live music acts] to book the large stadiums, but the rules continue to be far more restrictive for alternative outdoor venues … There doesn’t seem to be much logic behind it.” At the time of writing, an outdoor event outside a stadium setting is capped at 5,000 people in NSW. This means the traditional Carols in the Domain has had to be reimagined as a largely televised event, yet three weeks later up to 80,000 soccer fans will be allowed to flood into ANZ Stadium for the Sydney FC v Wanderers FC match. In Victoria, both indoor and outdoor seated entertainment venues can now open for up to 75% of capacity, but with no more than 1,000 people. Yet Victorian health authorities recently granted a special exemption for up to 30,000 people to attend the Boxing Day Test (India v Australia) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Any outdoor live music event in Victoria over the summer wanting to sell more than 1,000 tickets will have to seek an exemption requiring approval from the chief health officer and the ministerial taskforce, including three government state ministers: health, police and major events. In South Australia, more than 25,000 spectators are expected to be allowed into the first India v Australia Test at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday. Yet the Botanic Park has been deemed too risky to allow the Womadelaide four-day music festival to go ahead as usual in March. It has been reduced to a single stage with individually reserved seats in King Rodney Park, with a cap of just 6,000 people per concert. Then there is the issue of singing. “We’ve all been told that singing is a Covid-19 health risk, but they’re still singing the national anthem before most large sporting events,” Richardson said. Live music followers have said the differences between gigs and sporting matches make them feel hard done by. “As we move forwards into 2021 and governments further lift restrictions across the country, we would like to see alignment between sport and cultural settings,” Richardson said. “All events require Covid-safe plans and our industry has developed robust guidelines to support our reactivation. “Ironing out these anomalies will greatly assist the industry in getting our shows back on stage and our people back to work.”",culture

"With the money yet to start flowing from the federal government’s $250m Covid-19 rescue package for the arts, sectors of the Australian industry continue to raise concerns over the transparency of the process amid fears that smaller states and organisations may miss out. $75m of the package will be allocated directly from the arts minister’s office under the Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (Rise) fund. In contrast, the Australia Council for the Arts – the statutory body founded on the principles of peer assessment and arm’s-length funding – will receive just $35m, with the government earmarking those funds away from smaller organisations and to be awarded to “significant commonwealth-funded arts and culture organisations”. To date the minister, Paul Fletcher, had received “about 280 eligible applications” to the Rise fund, a spokesman said in a statement on Wednesday. Senate estimates heard on 21 October that the department expected to get the money flowing by November, but that deadline has now changed to “before the end of the year”. On 13 November, the first hearing for a federal government inquiry into Australia’s creative and cultural industries and institutions will take place in Canberra. Two recurrent themes among the 252 submissions lodged with the inquiry so far are the need to separate politics from funding decisions, and concerns that small- to medium-tier organisations will be overlooked. An arts and cultural management academic from the University of Melbourne, Associate Prof Dr Jo Caust, told Guardian Australia those fears might not be unfounded. “When there’s political involvement in grants decision-making, it can end up being a rort of some sort,” she said, referring to the so-called “sports rorts” controversy earlier this year, and an ABC investigation in May alleging that $44 million in New South Wales arts funding had been funnelled into Coalition electorates in the lead-up to the 2018 state election. “It’s really important that there is some distance between the [grant] decision-making and the political structure,” Caust said. Another concern, she said, was that conservative government funding decisions tended to favour large, flagship companies and high art. “When there is an ambivalence towards the arts sector, as we are experiencing now under the current federal government, the smaller organisations will suffer the most as they are less visible to the politicians.” Fletcher’s spokesman said there was nothing unusual about the Rise allocation decisions coming directly out of the minister’s office, and that the electorate of an application “does not have any bearing” on the score it receives in the process. “In addition to balancing funding across organisation size, we are also committed to ensuring representation across other measures, such as different art forms, diverse groups and geographic locations,” he said. “When we announce the successful applicants, we will provide information on this spread to look to alleviate any concerns.” With more than two-thirds of Australia’s 30 major performing arts companies based in NSW, Victoria or Queensland, there have been concerns raised that smaller states may not receive equitable treatment. In its submission to the inquiry, the Arts Industry Council of South Australia said it was concerned that “the small to medium sector in South Australia will not receive the full benefit of the [$250m] creative economy support package, especially as the fund is not being administered via the Australia Council”. Speaking to the Guardian, the council’s executive director, Julianne Pierce, said: “Our concern in South Australia [which has no national arts organisations] is that the small to medium sector is the bedrock here. “Obviously the [federal rescue package] is welcome, but we believe the money must flow down to artists and art workers, rather than just propping up large organisations.” Country Arts SA urged the inquiry to “maintain clear distinctions between the role and purpose of the Office for the Arts [Fletcher’s office] and the Australia Council”. Shelagh Magadza, the executive director of the Chamber for Arts and Culture in Western Australia, said funding at the federal level tended to take a “one size fits all” approach that disadvantaged less-populated states, where small to medium arts organisations required more nuanced and locally focused support. The potential for political interference in the grant deciding process was a perennial issue, she said. “I think this reflects years of discussion … It possibly came to a head in 2016, with the [George] Brandis situation, and things have never really settled since then.”  The “Brandis situation” occurred in 2015, when the then-arts minister redirected $104.8m away from the Australia Council to create an “arts excellence” fund directly dispersed from the minister’s office. Labor and arts organisations across Australia campaigned heavily against the removal of the “arm’s length” principle of arts funding under the Brandis scheme. His successor, Mitch Fifield, reversed the scheme and returned most of the funding back to the Australia Council the following year. Caust said the $75m Rise funding appeared to be a return to the Brandis model. “The minister [is having] the final decision, and that’s really problematic.” When announcing the federal government arts rescue package, Fletcher said “experienced assessors will assess each application on its merit and compare it to other eligible applications”. The assessors would be “officials from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications”, he said. A creative economy taskforce was appointed to advise the assessors but it has no say on where the money goes, its chair, Elizabeth Ann Macgregor, said in October.",culture

"It is best known for its collection of some of the most iconic cars of the past 100 years, so the Lakeland Motor Museum’s latest addition to its repertoire is likely to raise some eyebrows. A Vauxhall Corsa, one of the UK’s most commonly used cars of the past three decades, will soon be displayed alongside a collection of rare vehicles. Museum curators predict the 1994 GLS model could become one of their rarest exhibits, given its rapid decline in popularity. “We’re playing a long game with this car,” said the duty manager, Chris Williams. “At the moment you’d think you’d be far more likely to see one of these in a supermarket car park than a museum, but numbers are dwindling very fast and this model is around five years away from becoming extinct.”  For every new exhibit, an old one has to be removed. As a result, one of the Backbarrow museum’s longer-term residents, a 1973 Austin Allegro, has moved on to the Haynes International Motor Museum in Somerset, after being on display since 2010. Practical Classics magazine has praised the bold move, writing: “We say well done Lakeland Motor Museum for pulling off a classic world first!” Williams said that based on current projections by the motoring industry, there would be hardly any of this particular model of Corsa left by 2025. “With that in mind, we are getting one now while they are still relatively easy to find. I actually feel a bit nostalgic about this car as I had a 2000 version myself – same style, same engine. We are all about unlocking memories, and in a few years we think this particular car will certainly achieve that goal. Remember: every new car gets old,” he said. As the Cumbrian attraction prepares to reopen its doors in December, the team has been hard at work to ensure new vehicles are brought in for Christmas and the new year. “It’s certainly been a busy few weeks here at the museum, with quite a few new cars being prepared for display. There are plenty more to come and we are looking forward to revealing more details over the next few weeks,” Williams said.",culture
"It has been a long time coming but a decision on whether east London will get a slice of Las Vegas in the form of a state-of-the art entertainment venue almost as tall as St Paul’s may be nigh. The Madison Square Garden Sphere in Stratford would, its owners claim, create 4,300 construction jobs and a further 3,200 when it opens. Capable of hosting concerts for 21,500 people, the Sphere will feature the largest, highest resolution screen in the world, according to MSG, which owns many US entertainment venues. But the project, the brainchild of MSG’s chief executive, James Dolan, a major donor to Donald Trump, is proving divisive. When it was unveiled in 2018, the Sphere received support from the then culture secretary, Matt Hancock, and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. But since then local councillors, many residents and a rival entertainment giant have come out against it. A decision on whether to approve the Sphere was supposed to have been reached by the end of this year after the initial application was made in March 2019, but the public consultation had to be extended for a third time – until 4 December – amid concerns about its impact on the area. Lyn Garner, the chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation, whose planning committee holds the fate of the scheme in its hands, recently suggested a determination will be reached in January. A rejection would be a major setback for MSG. The firm hopes to roll out the concept in other countries but so far has only one Sphere under construction, in Las Vegas. MSG says an independent survey it commissioned found 85% of people supported the plan. But Lindesay Mace, of Stop MSG Sphere, a group of Newham residents who fear the Sphere will “blight the area”, described the polling as a sham. “Something like 80% of people surveyed hadn’t even heard about the proposal,” she said. We would ask: “Did the pollsters tell them about it or show them images before they asked whether they supported it? Did they discuss any negative aspects about the Sphere?” A central concern is light. The Sphere will have a “digital skin” stretched over a 2-hectare facade featuring nearly 1m external LEDs. MSG stresses it will be dimmed after 11pm to barely above that of twilight, but this does not reassure opponents. “To put a 90 metre by 120 metre glowing blob among people’s flats is just completely crazy,” Mace said. “It’s the wrong development for the wrong area.” But residents opposed to the scheme believe the odds are against them, pointing out that of 12 members on the corporation’s planning committee only five are elected local councillors. Some have also questioned whether London needs another giant venue. AEG, the operator of the nearby O2 arena, warns that the scheme would place huge pressure on local infrastructure. MSG points out that London has only two large capacity indoor arenas capable of hosting major acts – the 02 and the SSE Arena Wembley – while New York has seven, and Berlin, Paris and Madrid all have more large venues per person than London. And it claims that the Sphere will be more than a music arena, a unique venue that can host immersive, interactive experiences such as eGaming competitions. “MSG Sphere will be a state-of-the-art entertainment venue that supports thousands of good jobs and generates billions of pounds of economic benefit,” a spokesman said. “Our planning application reflects the constructive dialogue we have had with a range of stakeholders and demonstrates the thoughtful consideration that has gone into every aspect of our proposal.” So far, almost 2,000 documents relating to the planning application have been submitted to the development corporation. Despite this, Mace said MSG had yet to address many concerns relating to noise, travel, air and light pollution. “MSG have made a lot of noise about the consultation that they have carried out with local residents, but it does feel like a David and Goliath battle.’’",culture
"As Marc Burrows’ article (Million-pound question: why save Secret Cinema while real cinemas are in ruins?, 14 October) acknowledges, “there may be some comparison of apples with oranges here”. To strain the metaphor, the government’s culture recovery fund is a rich orchard of different fruit. The article focuses on one grant to one organisation, Secret Cinema, that is part of a bigger funding picture, including support from the BFI for independent cinema. In doing so, it ignores the breadth of the fund’s positive impact on people’s lives across England. The portion of the fund that the Arts Council administers is demand-led, with the aim of preventing vulnerable but valued cultural organisations from becoming insolvent. To qualify for funding, organisations need to be at risk of financial failure. Awards of all sizes have been made, proportionate to the needs of the organisations. They also have to show that they are culturally significant. This criterion centres on the value of the work they do in their communities and on the national stage. In the first two rounds of the funding alone, nearly 2,000 grants have been awarded to a vast range of brilliant organisations. Our creative organisations generate economic returns, provide freelance opportunities, undertake valuable community work and make art that will be remembered for generations.

"Ancient mammoth tusk is a seriously niche material to work in, but there is one place where the skills and carving techniques involved are still passed down the generations. A major new British Museum exhibition, Arctic: Culture and Climate, which starts this week in London, will feature an extraordinary piece of “very rare” sculpture, one that details an arcane ritual and has been completed in collaboration with the Sakha people of north-eastern Russia. The exhibition, which opens on Thursday, has brought together the largest and most wide-ranging collection of objects from some of the northern-most regions of the world to be displayed in Britain. It focuses not just on details of ancient traditions but on the impact of political and climate change. Alongside other archeological finds and historic artefacts, such as an antique sled from Greenland and a bronze Evenki spirit mask, the public will have the first chance to see a newly-complete mammoth tusk model, originally made almost 200 years ago and depicting an ancient annual summer festival known as “yhyakh”. “The people of this Sakha community had a very strong revival after the Soviet era ended,” said British Museum curator Amber Lincoln. “Their belief system persists as a faith, although some are also Christian now. Nowadays the yhyakh serves as much as a ritual about national or ethnic identity as for its original purpose of celebrating the summer and praying for good weather.” Museum experts now have a clearer picture of the ceremony because of the help of art students from the Sakha region who spotted that the model had missing components. It had been lent to Russia for an exhibition, and while on show two students worked to make new figures to finish the scene. On the model’s return, ahead of the new London show, curators commissioned a Sakha artist and master carver, Fedor Markov, to work on fresh replacements for the display. “Carving the tusk is a high and specialist artform. As a material, it has a different quality to the walrus tusks the Inuit peoples use,” said Lincoln, who also had to request from the Sakha authorities a particularly high quality tusk for Markov to work on. “We really benefited from what the students had noticed in Russia. Aside from the fact it is a very rare object, it is fantastic to have it in the gallery this month because it is almost like a teaching tool, showing visitors how the real ritual items in the gallery were originally used.” The semi-nomadic community of Sakha, who call themselves “people of the sun”, and are also known as Yakuts, are a Turkic ethnic group who still celebrate two key religious festivals each year, both revolving around fermented mare’s milk, or koumiss. “The ceremony’s name can be translated as “sprinkling”, because that’s what the shaman does with the mare’s milk,” explained Lincoln. “It is a way of calling for good weather that will lead to a good harvest. The 24-hour sun at that time of year in the arctic means that if the weather is good there can be an abundance of hay that would take them all the way through the winter. So it was a key moment in their year.” The model shows the central figures of the summer solstice ceremony, with a conical tent and the ceremonial jug and drinking vessels, all corralled inside a fenced area that has been delicately hewn from wood and from preserved mammoth tusk. Still precious and uncommon, the tusks are actually found with increasing frequency due to the impact of global heating on the polar ice cap. “The permafrost is melting more, and more and so these mammoth tasks are being found a bit more often. It’s an amazing example of how museums and indigenous communities can work together to create something that explains a new bit of history and gives us new knowledge to share,” said Lincoln.",culture
"Autumnal days are drawing in and Covid-19 restrictions are tightening. But it is not all doom and gloom. The world of culture is fighting back, aiming to boost the spirit of a nation. Here are just a few highlights to look forward to. Autumn and the lead up to Christmas are a busy time for publishers, even busier this year because of postponements. For escapism away from pandemic reality, there is a huge choice. Fiction includes the last two unpublished novels from the Booker longlist: Gabriel Krauze’s Who They Was (4th Estate), which is set amid London’s gang culture; and the US author Diane Cook’s The New Wilderness (Oneworld), in which a mother and daughter embark on a dangerous experiment in living. Meanwhile, Don DeLillo’s The Silence, which was completed just weeks before coronavirus hit, is set in the near future about five people gathered together in a Manhattan apartment during a different kind of catastrophic event. For those from whom lockdown offered an opportunity to hone culinary skills, there is inspiration in the form of Ottolenghi Flavour (Ebury Press), by Yotam Ottolenghi, Nadiya Bakes (Michael Joseph), by Nadiya Hussain, and Cook, Eat, Repeat, by Nigella Lawson (Chatto). And not forgetting the celebrity memoirs, with Ant and Dec’s Once Upon a Tyne: Our Story Celebrating 30 Years Together on Telly (Sphere) on some people’s Christmas list. With planned releases of the next James Bond thriller, No Time to Die, and Steven Spielberg’s remake of West Side Story both pushed back, times are uncertain in the cinema world. Mank is David Fincher’s first movie as director since Gone Girl in 2014, with Netflix announcing it is headed to cinemas in November and will be available on its streaming platform from 4 December. The black-and-white biopic follows the life of the screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz and his battle with Orson Welles over the screenplay credit of Citizen Kane. It stars Gary Oldman as Mankiewicz. Also due for release in coming weeks is Death on the Nile, with Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot and Wonder Woman 1984, starring Gal Gadot and set in the middle of the cold war. Dark nights before the small screen beckon, and despite the pandemic shaking up the TV industry, there is something for everyone to look forward to. The return of The Crown (season 4), on Netflix from 15 November, is the last to feature Olivia Colman as Queen before she hands the baton over to Imelda Staunton, and focuses on the 1980s, with Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher. Small Axe, on BBC One from 15 November, is from the Oscar-winning writer and director Steve McQueen, and stars the Star Wars actor John Boyega as well as Line of Duty’s Rochenda Sandall. Set within the West Indian community, the five episodes begin with Enoch Powell’s notorious “Rivers of Blood” speech of 1968. Sky’s The Undoing, which broadcasts from 26 October, casts Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant in a tense drama about a woman whose husband goes missing. ITV’s offers include The Sister, broadcast date to be confirmed, a murder mystery from the Luther creator Neil Cross that stars Russell Tovey. Of course, Christmas Day would not be complete, it seems, without the Call the Midwife festive special on BBC One. Andy Warhol at Tate Modern has been one of the must-see exhibitions of 2020. It has been extended until 15 November and features Warhol’s famed images of Marilyn Monroe and Campbell’s Soup Cans, as well as some largely unseen paintings from the 1970s. The Royal Academy’s annual summer exhibition, which for the first time since 1769 is staged in winter, runs until 3 January. Wrap up well to enjoy the last few days of Anish Kapoor at Houghton Hall in Norfolk. The exhibition of 21 sculptures, many in the gardens, and a selection of drawings spanning 40 years closes on 1 November. Titian: Love, Desire, Death at the National Gallery in London, reunites the six paintings from a series inspired by Ovid’s Metamorphoses for the first time in more than four centuries and runs until 17 January. Also at the National Gallery, the recently opened Artemisia exhibition continues until 24 January. In 17th-century Italy, Artemisia Gentileschi became one of the most celebrated female painters of her time. Slowly but surely theatres are attempting to reopen. The National Theatre celebrates the return of live performance, Covid measures in place, with Death of England: Delroy. Penned by Clint Dyer and Roy Williams, it runs until 28 November and explores a black working-class man searching for truth and confronting his relationship with Great Britain. The West End operator Nimax Theatres has socially distanced performances of several plays, including Six, a musical with a different take on Henry VIII’s wives, and The Play That Goes Wrong. The Nottingham Playhouse, New Vic theatre in Staffordshire, King’s theatre in Portsmouth and many more regional venues are opening their doors. Panto season will also soon be here in some shape or form. Oh yes it will. It’s not Christmas without The Nutcracker set to Tchaikovsky’s glorious score, and the Royal Albert Hall ensures 2020 is no exception. Socially distanced performances from Birmingham’s Royal Ballet will bring Clara’s toys to life and transport you through a fantastical winter wonderland to the kingdom of the Sugar Plum fairy. Sadler’s Well promises a special programme of live dance and digital content, including performances for socially distanced audiences – with seating for separate households only. Live events include English National Ballet performing a specially commissioned programme of five world premieres from Arielle Smith, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, Russell Maliphant, Yuri Possokhov and Stina Quagebeur. In addition there is the rescheduled world premiere performances of Alexander Whitley Company’s Overflow, a mini festival of new work from Breakin’ Convention, and the return of Arthur Pita’s family favourite The Little Match Girl for two weeks at Christmas.",culture
"Born in Portland, Maine, Elizabeth Strout, 64, is the author of six novels including Olive Kitteridge (2008), which won the Pulitzer prize for fiction and has sold more than 1m copies. She published her first short story in 1982 but didn’t find wider success until her debut novel, Amy and Isabelle, came out 16 years later. Her latest novel, Olive, Again, a follow-up to her 2008 bestseller, has just been released in paperback. Strout and her husband, James, a former attorney general, divide their time between homes in Manhattan and Maine. Hélène Grimaud Recently I was listening to a Mozart Pandora [a US music streaming service] station and all of a sudden I sat up and thought: Who is playing that piano piece? It turned out the pianist was Hélène Grimaud. How could it be that I had never heard of her? She is astonishing, magical. She has a touch that feels like no other I’ve heard; firm, electric. This has been an amazing discovery for me. Rumford, Maine During this pandemic, my husband and I grew restless and so we drove to the town of Rumford, Maine, two hours away. Rumford historically was a mill town. The mill owner had come in 1905 and built a series of beautiful houses on the hills of the town for the mill workers to live in. Over time, the mill lost business, and is now producing only a fraction of what it once did. The population has fallen 50%. We found a ghost town; the beautiful houses remained, but were in shambles, with many people out in front of them on an autumn weekday, debris lying everywhere. There were Trump signs on the lawns. Such is the cultural and class divide in this country right now. Edward Hopper One thing I have noticed during this pandemic is how much the work of Edward Hopper continues to comfort me. I have many books, large ones, of his works, and I will thumb through them. It reminds me of a time a number of years ago when the Whitney had a show of Hopper. I had done an event with the poet Anne Carson there, and so the museum director allowed me in to the exhibit that night all by myself. What a thrill! To be able to see Hopper’s works without peering behind anyone. But I got too excited, and I almost could not absorb what I was seeing. Such was the state of my exhilaration. Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St Vincent Millay by Nancy Milford This biography of Edna St Vincent Millay is quite a read. As a child, the suffering of Millay is really estimable; her mother was always gone – she was a nurse – and Millay was left to take care of her two younger sisters in a house where the pipes would freeze and burst. The girls then skated across the kitchen floor. Millay’s imagination seemed with her from the beginning. She made up a mother and wrote to her. This was not her real mother, to whom she also wrote. I am impressed that the child knew intuitively what to do to survive. Call My Agent! Call My Agent! is a French-made series that started on French television in 2015, and is now available on Netflix. It’s – to me – immensely enjoyable, watching the different agents fight among themselves to get various stars, who also have a variety of problems. It’s tense and taut and also funny. Cleaning the house I play the piano at least an hour a day, and that is probably the only thing that comes close to being a hobby of mine. But during this pandemic our housecleaner has gone to work in a nursing home, and so I have been cleaning the house. I cleaned houses in my youth for a number of years and I always did a good job, because I was conscientious. But I hated it. So now, I pretend that I am a maid, and as I wash the floors I sing to myself. It’s been interesting. I know to wait until I feel like doing it, and then I wash the bathtub with gusto, singing my heart out.",culture
"Over seven seasons, Last Week Tonight has covered numerous aspects of the byzantine US immigration system, from immigration courts, to border patrols, to the Trump administration’s disastrous “zero tolerance” family separation policy. And on Sunday, host John Oliver turned to a narrow slice of America’s legal immigration network: asylum, or the legal process by which people who flee persecution apply to stay in the United States. Trump has repeatedly denigrated asylum seekers and discredited the process as a scam, although “as you’ve probably guessed”, Oliver said, “the asylum process isn’t a simple recitation of magic words by which all manner of fraudulent claims are let through, nor is it responsible for, as Trump’s official White House website calls it, the ‘biggest loophole to gain entry into our great country’”. Asylum seekers are like Berta, a woman featured in the Netflix documentary Immigration Nation, who fled Honduras after MS-13 gang members threatened to light her on fire and force her 12-year-old granddaughter into marriage. Berta turned herself into US authorities at the border as she claimed asylum, only to be separated from her granddaughter and held indefinitely in a US detention center. “That is ridiculous – if you asked the cops for help and responded by throwing you into detention, you’d be absolutely furious,” said Oliver of Berta’s case. “You’d probably also be black, but let’s try to take this one systemic social crisis at a time.” Berta’s story is not a one-off, Oliver continued, because the Trump administration’s attack on asylum has been “focused, dedicated and deeply resourceful. And I know that those aren’t adjectives you’re used to associating with this administration, but in this one area, they’ve been truly disciplined about being truly evil.” Typically, Oliver explained, asylum seekers turn themselves into authorities at the border for a “credible fear” screening, and are allowed to stay in the US pending a date in immigration courts. Even before Trump, less than half of those requests were granted; claimants often don’t have a lawyer, and the bar for asylum is high, as you have to prove persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion – criteria the Trump administration has applied narrowly. In other words, “the asylum process has never been easy”, said Oliver, “but this administration has made it absolute hell” with new protocols that “don’t have the harrowing ring of family separation” but represent “another cruel, calculated decision that has largely flown under the radar”. The “Remain in Mexico” program, for example, has forced asylum seekers to await judgments from deliberately backlogged immigration courts in makeshift, inadequate and unsafe refugee camps in Mexico. Conditions are often unsanitary and unsafe; as of May, there were at least 1,114 publicly reported cases of murder, rape, torture, kidnapping and other violent assaults on migrants sent back to Mexico unnecessarily by the US. Kidnappings are such a fact of life, Oliver added, that cartels will give some people a codename upon release to indicate, if they were captured again, that they had already paid a ransom. “It’s pretty bleak when drug cartels have a more efficient system for keeping track of asylum seekers than the US government,” Oliver said. Many migrants relegated to Mexico have missed their asylum hearings in the US, a fact the acting homeland security secretary and “human razor burn” Chad Wolf attributed to “walking away” from not having a “meritorious claim”. “These hearings are migrants’ only shot at getting to safety; it’s everything they’ve been waiting for, and if they miss their hearing, they lose their case,” Oliver retorted. “So a person not showing up in court after you forced them to wait in a dangerous area without adequate shelter or support isn’t proof they were trying to cheat the system. It’s proof your system is not fucking working.” The government hasn’t made the hearings easy to attend; immigration attorneys have reported hearings scheduled for outside court hours and notices without date or time. Basically, “the government system is about as effective as painting ‘meet us at the place’ on a raccoon and just throwing it over the wall into Mexico”, Oliver said. “Good luck getting the instructions, and if you do, good luck figuring out how to follow them.” And then there’s Title 42, a provision outside immigration code that gives the federal government broad power to act during a public health crisis. The Trump administration, citing the coronavirus pandemic, has invoked Title 42 to close the border and eject migrants with pending applications in what Oliver called “a transparent attempt to exploit this pandemic to do whatever they want with migrants”. “Invoking Title 42 has basically created a shadow deportation system that moves quickly and is accountable to no one,” Oliver added; since March, there have been 197,371 expulsions of asylum seekers, without a successful court hearing. The system, Oliver concluded, is “shattered”, and potentially solidifying, as the Trump administration aims to make Title 42 permanent, drafted new regulations to reject asylum requests outright and redesigned the application process in English, with impossibly tight deadlines. For those despairing, Oliver concluded, “there is actually one thing you can do: you can vote for Joe Biden”. Although the American immigration system has been “pretty shitty under Democratic administrations too, like the one Joe Biden was in for eight years” and Biden isn’t “the perfect candidate” (Oliver found his stance against Medicare for All “utterly ridiculous” and “aviator glasses should only be worn by hot pilots, cute babies and cute baby pilots”), Biden has promised to end the Remain in Mexico policy and restore asylum eligibility for domestic violence survivors and victims of gang persecution. “The fact is, a lot of our immigration policy is set solely by the executive branch,” Oliver concluded. “We can’t begin to fix the damage done by this administration until we replace the administration itself.”",culture
"When I was told to write one of these 10 funniest things on the internet columns my first thought was, “Oh no, the internet isn’t for remembering things.” My second thought was, “Oh no, I don’t know what’s funny.” And my third thought was, “They’re really letting anyone do one of these.” Does it count if it’s on the internet but was originally on something else? Because that’s a lot of things. So it’s always good to start with an existential lack of confidence in the fundamental structures of the game. Most of my memories of laughing at the internet come from when I was about 15 – a period when the internet was on a big clumpy desktop in our living room, when I was cackling with my twin brother over things that almost certainly don’t hold up today, and which I can’t bear to go back to in case they don’t. One was a website that had little animations of a dinosaur that was critical of capitalism, which I’ve found impossible to google. There was also a deeply worried existential bat character that I screenshot to use as my avatar on my teenage LiveJournal. Anyway, this list is as much “10 things I can remember from the internet” as anything else. This is just a man reading different questions from people about pregnancy where they’ve misspelled the word “pregnant”. For a list of queries, a high proportion of which were probably written amid deep human emotion, and that might be characterised as punching down, this builds a level of absurdity that I find irresistible. “PREGANANANT” just hits the sweet spot for me. Zach Baron’s GQ interview with Robert Pattinson is beautifully written, and the description about three-quarters of the way through of Pattinson’s attempt to cook his own recipe is gorgeous. It escalates into absurdity and, as Baron acknowledges, he’s not sure if Pattinson is doing a bit, being earnestly incompetent, completely unhinging from reality, or a bit of each. The best way to enjoy this is to read it out loud to a friend. It’s no secret that I love Laura Davis. She’s glorious, and her deeply under-appreciated comedy chops are undeniable. Gobby or Shark is a clip of standup that’s a great example of her combination of brutality and wistfulness. I’d recommend getting onboard with all her work, including her latest album, The Bus Show, which was recorded in a cupboard during lockdown and is one of the most successful versions of comedy-without-an-audience I’ve experienced. Why do I find people finding things funny so funny? One of the things I can’t resist is other people laughing at stuff. It brings me joy and may well be one of the reasons I love doing comedy. The Toast was consistently brilliant and I’m sad it’s shut down, but I regularly go back to the Two Monks series when I’m miserable and it always makes me laugh. It’s hard to choose just one but here you go. Daniel Lavery is one of my favourite internet writers, sliding effortlessly between the beauty of linguistic stylings that can be understood as a sort of stylistic historical fanfiction and an extremely modern internet sensibility. His book, Something That May Shock and Discredit You, is surreal and incisive. A little song about Bible stories. It’s sweet, heartbreaking, gorgeously musical, political, deeply human and very funny, which is a lot to fit into 3:07. In fact, the whole album is beautiful, and my favourite song on it isn’t comedy at all. I saw the show Love you, Hate Bastards in Edinburgh last year and it made me laugh and then cry hysterically, which is maybe not comedy, but is my favourite kind of comedy. I thought it was quite funny in retrospect that it had made me cry so much, so made a friend play the album in the car on a long drive, and was telling her when the sad song came up that it was the one that made me cry, and then I cried hysterically again in her car, to everyone’s great embarrassment. This is a gorgeous short film, beautifully shot by the puppeteer Johannes Nyholm, predicated on the old premise that toddlers are tiny drunks or destructive Vikings. It’s way too much effort for a very simple joke; it’s weirdly melancholy, surprisingly provocative, existentially dumb and it makes me laugh. There are a million videos of my two year old niece on our family WhatsApp finding normal things hilarious that are funnier than anything and I would include them here were it not a breach of her tiny dignity. That said, other people’s families are way less worried about baby privacy and this is a good example of the genre. These stories from Charlie Murphy of his Hollywood experiences are related hilariously by Murphy, re-enacted hilariously by Dave Chappelle, but the actual commentary from Rick James makes this a top-notch piece of comedy. Kate McKinnon is always funny and these sketches are funny, sad and funny. I love Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, I love Bec Shaw, I have mixed feelings about puns. This is a rollercoaster for me, every time, and Bec’s commitment to enjoying it gives me hope.",culture
"The goodwill that inevitably greeted this double bill – a proper staged event with live music! – couldn’t quite hide the disappointment with the first half. Hannah Kendall’s opera The Knife of Dawn, originally staged at the Roundhouse in 2016, is a rather laboured and didactic piece that succeeds only in informing us about a largely forgotten moment in colonial history. It follows the aftermath of the 1953 elections in British Guiana, the first under universal suffrage, which were overturned by British authorities. The story is told from the point of view of the Guyanese poet Martin Carter, one of the many members of the victorious People’s Progressive Party who was jailed. He is on hunger strike and is starting to hallucinate, haunted by offscreen female voices – his wife and daughter, other political prisoners, long-dead Guyanese slaves – who drive him to the brink of madness. Despite a fine performance by baritone Peter Braithwaite, the monologue lacks any dramatic momentum, mistaking showing for telling. We are told that Carter is a great poet, which he was, but it’s not evident from Tessa McWatt’s excruciating libretto, which spends an hour outlining the historical background and ends just as it starts to explore any artistic and emotional ramifications. Much more effective is the second half of the bill, New Dark Age, in which existing compositions by three leading contemporary composers are reworked into a 10-part song suite that narrates post-pandemic life, accompanied by Grant Gee’s artful slow-motion film. The only original piece is Anna Meredith’s swooping Fly By Night, but even the compositions that are more than five years old, such as Missy Mazzoli’s quartet from Vespers for a New Dark Age, setting poems by Matthew Zapruder, seem to have an eerie post-Covid resonance. The shimmering Vivaldi-meets-Philip Glass textures of Meredith’s Stoop seem to sum up a locked-down population straining to enjoy the bright sunshine of April 2020, while Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s two choral pieces – a blend of austere medieval plainsong and holy minimalism – serve as a threnody for the victims of the pandemic. By the end of the suite, with Meredith’s bleak a cappella Heal You (text by Philip Ridley) and her icy, discordant, malfunctioning harpsichord-and-strings piece Low Light, the bemasked audience at the ROH seemed emotionally prepared for a second lockdown.",culture
"Late-night hosts took aim at Donald Trump’s performance at the final presidential debate while also ridiculing his decision to leak footage of his 60 Minutes interview. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert was live after the debate and said that “the highlight for me is that we’ll never have to watch Trump debate ever again”. When speaking of the final tussle, he said: “It’s like dental surgery” except the president isn’t experiencing toothache, “he’s hurting for cash” after news emerged that the campaign was forced to cancel TV ads because of a shortage of funds. “After tonight his best hope for advertising is standing on a street corner with one of them flippy arrows,” Colbert joked. Throughout the debate, Trump spouted mostly fabricated numbers, as per usual. “The president has numbers even though the numbers don’t make any sense?” Colbert asked while showing footage of him claiming that 99.9% of young people survive the coronavirus with no problem “You know old people are the ones that vote, right?” Colbert joked. Trump also called New York a ghost town. Colbert countered: “When you come to New York, those aren’t ghosts on the street, those are people booing you.” The president also complained about restaurants using Plexiglass protection for diners. “Trump doesn’t want to be wrapped in plastic, it ruins the feeling. And if it breaks, you wind up with an Eric,” Colbert joked. When Trump’s many accounts and many losses were brought up, he said he “was a businessman doing business”, which amused Colbert. “Trump sounds like three kids stacked in a trench coat trying to be an adult,” he said. Trump also tried to claim Joe Biden was lying about where he came from. “Where do you think Joe’s from? Nairobi’s big Irish Catholic neighbourhood,” Colbert joked. By the end, he reminded his audience that “the ultimate mute button is in your hands”. On Late Night, Seth Meyers talked about Trump’s week of “whining about the moderator” while also releasing “deeply embarrassing footage” of him having a tantrum during a 60 Minutes interview. Meyers called it “genuinely one of the most embarrassing and cringe-inducing things I’ve seen on video”. During the interview, Trump couldn’t come up with details on how those with pre-existing conditions would be protected without the Affordable Care Act. “He doesn’t have a plan to protect people with pre-existing conditions, he has a plan to give people pre-existing conditions,” Meyers said in reference to his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic. He has continued to refer to “a bogus criminal investigation” into the Biden family, calling Joe a vacuum cleaner who sucks up the money his son Hunter has left for him. “You don’t get to call anyone else a vacuum cleaner when every time you give a speech you suck in air like a Dirt Devil,” Meyers said. He also compared his tactics to exactly what he did with Hillary Clinton in 2016. “Trump’s like the guy who uses the same pickup line on every woman he meets because it worked once in 1990,” he joked. Meyers moved on to Rudy Giuliani, the “Italian Wile E Coyote” who was caught in a compromising situation in the new Borat movie. “If Rudy hadn’t been tricked by a Sacha Baron Cohen character, I would have assumed he was a Sacha Baron Cohen character,” he said. On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah spoke about Trump’s embarrassing 60 Minutes footage. “I don’t think it shows what he thinks it does,” Noah said. Before the interview started, Lesley Stahl asked Trump if he was OK for some tough questions and he said no he wasn’t. “It’s like at a concert when they go ‘Are you ready to rock?’, no one in the crowd is like, ‘No thanks Mr Bon Jovi.’” He continued: “Only Donald Trump would think he could choose the level of difficulty of his interview questions.” Noah said it was as if “he thinks it’s like picking the spiciness of his Chinese food”. He finished by saying: “What blows my mind the most is that Trump posted this video, thinking it somehow makes him look good. It’s like making your Tinder profile a picture of you crying in the shower.”",culture
"Judith Hughes, a Melbourne Theatre Company subscriber, sees seven shows a year, organising tickets for a group of 11 women with an average age of 65. She is eager for the company to reopen its doors. “The general feeling among our group is that we’ll do what we can to support the arts and we want to get back in the theatre as long as we can do it safely,” she says. Anecdotally, the sentiment seems shared by theatre audiences across the country. Mitchell Butel, artistic director of the State Theatre Company of South Australia, says demand for its first post-Covid shows, Gaslight and Ripcord, have been “through the roof. We were the first main stage back in the country and we had no seat to sell.” Box office statistics supplied by the Sydney Theatre Company show that three quarters of ticket buyers for Wonnangatta, its first post-lockdown show for 2020, had bought tickets to the company’s pre-Covid season.  But the enthusiasm isn’t necessarily reflected in other data. An Australia Council for the Arts sponsored survey tapped more than 12,000 arts lovers nationwide and 150 arts organisations. It included galleries and museums as well as performing arts groups and was taken three times, in May, July and September. Its September figures for attending cultural events as a whole were more confident than the previous two surveys, but show an understandable short-term caution. Despite a theoretical willingness to engage, only 29% of audience members surveyed were ready to attend an event as soon as permitted, with 29% of those who are residents in states where venues are open having attended a cultural event in the past fortnight. Only 14% were actually buying tickets for live shows and performances. But the production costs of putting on a show remain the same, whether you’re playing to 50 people or 500. This is a crucial factor influencing theatre companies’ programming and projection of box office revenue for 2021. How many tickets can they reasonably expect to sell in a limited audience return? Covid has also disrupted the subscription funding model that a majority of companies rely on. In a normal year, the theatre companies would be in the middle of launch season, with tickets for much of 2021 going on sale for subscribers to buy in packages of several shows at once. The funds brought in during the subscription period would then go into the budget for the following year. STCSA will launch its full 2021 season on 29 October but other companies are holding fire, with plans for limited season launches selling in stages, and with smaller subscription packages for those reluctant to commit long-term in an environment of uncertainty. This isn’t great for the bottom line, and it hasn’t helped that the only money spent from a $250m rescue package for the arts promised by the federal government back in June has gone to the screen industry. Of all the companies, those in Melbourne have dealt with the longest lockdowns and the harshest restrictions. Melbourne Theatre Company’s largest proportion of subscribers – 34% – are between the ages of 50 and 64, an age bracket more at risk from Covid complications. “It’s awfully challenging,” says MTC executive director Virginia Lovett. “At the beginning we went in hard and fast [with cancellations]. People re-booked for September, when we hoped to reopen, but we’ve had to cancel the rest of the year.” In pre-pandemic days, Australia’s not-for-profit performance companies were expected by funding bodies to be as commercially profitable as possible, to build up philanthropy and sponsorship income, and reduce their reliance on subsidies. Federal and state government subsidy more generally varies from theatre to theatre and this funding depends on the legal status of the company. Both STCSA and Queensland Theatre Company are statutory bodies, set up by acts of state legislation, and have greater state support; Melbourne Theatre Company is technically a department of the University of Melbourne, although both it and STC, a public company limited by guarantee, receive similar levels of government funding: between 6% and 7%. Many companies emphasise their box office revenue as a sign of this model working. MTC’s 2019 annual report touts box office receipts of $18.1m out of total revenue of $28.3m. For some state theatres, subscriptions represent an average of 50% of box office revenue. For the MTC, it’s 70%. The figures are the result of a campaign over the past few years that saw subscriber numbers grow 40% in 2018 to a high of 22,300, before dropping off last year to 20,315. Lovett is pessimistic about the ability of theatre companies to sustain revenue in a downward-turning market. “The recession will also mean a drop in sponsorship, philanthropy and corporate entertainment,” she says. This, she argues, means that the current government subsidy isn’t sufficient for what the company is expected to deliver during and in the aftermath of a pandemic. “It has to be between 15% and 18%,” she says. “If the governments are serious about us continuing to be a thriving part of the culture and want us to develop new work, be involved in education and touring, the subsidy has to increase.” Lovett says that MTC’s own research shows strong support and loyalty from existing subscribers, many of whom donated the cost of their cancelled tickets to the company. “They want to see good social distancing and we’re looking closely at what other theatres are doing,” says Lovett. “There will be a certain percentage who are very hesitant, but optimistically there is a very high number willing to return.” ",culture
"Ah yes, the internet. A dreamspace. A wonder of technology. A glorious vehicle for my ex to write on my Facebook wall, “I drew you a bunch of sick skeletons and astronauts but the trams are down in Bundoora so I’ll come deliver them tomorrow. Stay cool,” instead of visiting me in hospital and then using that very same internet to disappear for four years. She is many things, the great W Dot. Let me draw you a warm bath of my favourites. Chris Fleming is one of those polarising geniuses. He continues to make music when it is definitely not in his skillset. Despite this, he has created this Meatloaf-esque power ballad about an accountant with a cough. This is an anthem. Throw your damn hands up. His “Company’s coming” video is also a treat. I mean, it’s exactly what it says on the box. She feels pretty, she’s a Jet, she’s a Shark, and she is both halves of a forbidden love. There is a lot we can learn here about loving ourselves. The editing on this is so good. The rhythm of this comedy is almost like a song. The kids are spot on too. Oh my god I love this video. The way she says “They only live at night” is *chef’s kiss* perfect. You should also check out the Hello My Name Is series if you enjoy this as much as me. Honor Wolf and Patrick Durnan Silva are Hot Department. It was so hard to decide which video to feature because they are all perfect and also because they are highly explicit and I wasn’t sure what would be allowed through the gates. Their comedy is best described as chaotically horny. Check out Honor Wolf and Hot Department on Instagram and TikTok for the full suite. They have a porn parody called Stepmom Blues on YouTube that you can watch at your own risk. There is a bit in the song Astonishing from the musical of Little Women where the character stops singing and says very dramatically, “Christopher Columbus!”, before belting her absolute tits off. It is the essence of what people love and hate about musicals. This supercut of people really giving it for just that bit is so funny to me and may mean nothing to you but this is my article. I do not have TikTok but this dog is so funny it made me download the app. He goes to bark without realising he is underwater and dogs aren’t made to drink this way. He’s fine, I know this because my dog does this all the time. The way she screams “Noooooo!” every time he comes near her. What a perfect little dream. Jude has such a great voice. I’m a sucker for musical comedy. Jude dancing around Broden Kelly’s Hamish is so sweet and cringey. Jude is the most underrated person in Australia. If you enjoyed this, also check out Gillian Cosgriff. Jordan Firstman’s impressions on Instagram are world class so I wasn’t surprised to learn that he wrote this incredible song. The way Laura Dern reacts as she slowly realises what is happening is so sweet I don’t know if I want her to be my wife or my mum. It’s obvious that Aunty Donna rule the internet comedy space but everyone knows we are friends so I didn’t want to put them in for fear of being biased. Unfortunately the perfection of Montaigne’s soaring vocals and their rambling verses has forced my hand and so now you have to watch this.

"“As the election day barrels down on us like an out-of-control manure spreader, one of the last chances to influence the race is this Thursday’s presidential debate,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. After a widely panned first debate in which Donald Trump interrupted the moderator Chris Wallace and Democratic opponent Joe Biden a whopping 128 times, the commission on presidential debates announced the institution of a mute button to silence the opposing candidate’s microphone during two-minute responses (“open discussion” portions of the debate will proceed as normal). “While we’re at it, how about a fast-forward button?” Colbert wondered. “Just zip straight to November 3.” Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, blasted the rule change, calling it the commission’s “latest attempt to provide advantage to their favorite candidate”. “Enforcing the rules isn’t giving someone an advantage,” Colbert responded. “That’s like saying ‘the Olympic judges are playing favorites because they won’t let me throw bricks at Michael Phelps!’” However, the mute button could end up helping Trump, Colbert added, as his debate prep team has reportedly coached Trump to stop interrupting Biden and appear more “likable”. “Hold on, NOW they’re trying to make Trump more likable?” Colbert said. “He’s been president for almost four years! That’s like a firefighter showing up to your house and saying, ‘OK, let’s wait for everything to burn to the ground, then sprinkle a little water on there and see what happens.’” Meanwhile, as coronavirus cases rise sharply across the nation, Trump continued to brush aside the emergent third wave of the pandemic. At a rally on Monday night, Trump claimed America was “rounding the turn” on coronavirus, despite rising hospitalization numbers in 41 states. “Really? Rounding? Have you seen the Covid spikes?” Colbert retorted. “We’re not rounding the turn. I’m pretty sure we’re sharpening the turn. What we’re looking at here is a razor-sharp turn.” Instead, Trump has pivoted away from talking about the pandemic because, as he said, “people are pandemic-ed out”. “That’s quite a rallying cry when we’re facing an existential threat: ‘We’re tired of it!’” Colbert joked. The decision by the commission on presidential debates to mute candidates’ microphones during standard two-minute responses is “the same strategy my daughter’s teachers use for Zoom kindergarten”, joked Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night. “Would a mute button even work on Donald Trump? I feel like if you turn off his microphone he’ll just pull another one out of his hair or something.” Trump has predictably lashed out about the rule change on Fox News, where he claimed the decision was evidence of the commission’s bias against him. “Before every debate, every election, every interview even, he announces that they’re plotting against him,” Kimmel explained. “And in this case, even the guys who are running the sound system are plotting against him.” In two Fox News call-ins, Trump claimed the commission unfairly “modulated” and “oscillated” his microphone during the 2016 debates. “They oscillated it, they modulated it, they constipated it,” Kimmel joked. “These microphones are out to get the president – it’s a total pitch-hunt.” A better question, Kimmel added, is “how many months after he loses do you think Fox & Friends just stops taking his calls live on the show?” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also found the installation of a debate mute button to be probably futile. “Trump doesn’t care if you mute his microphone,” he said. “He’s just going to shout. Or even worse, he’ll just walk over to Biden and use his mic. He’ll probably lick it too just to mark his territory. “Clearly, Trump needs to enjoy his open mic time while he can,” he added, which is why Trump continues to hold large, in-person rallies across the country even as coronavirus cases surge. Despite outbreaks tied to his rallies in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in Minnesota, Trump has dismissed safety concerns because, as he claimed in a rally this week, people are “pandemic-ed out”. “Trump is not wrong about people being tired of the dealing with this pandemic,” Noah said. “But what he doesn’t seem to realize is that unlike the rest of us, he can actually do something about this. Instead, he’s acting like he’s as helpless as everyone else is.”",culture
"With The Late Show, Late Night, and the Daily Show all on vacation on Monday night, Jimmy Kimmel alone recapped the Los Angeles Lakers’ seventh NBA title and the president’s most recent antics. Monday marked the holiday formerly known as Columbus Day, now Indigenous Peoples’ Day – a fitting occasion for Trump to declare himself Covid-free, as the president and the 15th-century explorer “actually have a lot in common”, said Kimmel. “They both spread disease, and they both failed spectacularly at what they were hired to do.” The “contaminator-in-chief” was in Florida on Monday night to host a mask-less rally, which he claimed was OK-ed by doctors. “That’s good news, though – it’ll be nice to get back to having a president who’s only mentally ill,” Kimmel deadpanned. Since returning to the White House after a weekend stay at Walter Reed medical center, Trump has spun his bout with Covid, which was treated with top-of-the-line medical care, a personal team of physicians, and an intense therapy regimen – into a narrative of invincibility. The president called into Fox News over the weekend to brag that he felt “good, by the fact that the word immunity means something, having really a protective glow means something.” “It’s not a protective glow, though,” Kimmel responded. “That is Hawaiian Tropics mango-scented tanning mousse that you’re seeing.” And “if it sounds like Trump is trying to position himself as some kind of superhero now, um, listen to this,” Kimmel added, referencing a New York Times scoop over the weekend that Trump had discussed with advisers an idea for a laughably theatrical exit from Walter Reed hospital: a stunt in which the president would appear frail as he exited the hospital, only to rip open his button-down shirt to reveal a Superman T-shirt beneath as a show of strength. “This is not a joke. This is what he wanted to do,” Kimmel said of proposed stunt. “Whoever talked him out of this, I would like to bang you right on the head. “What would happen when he reveals the S on his chest – would the country erupt in applause?” the host wondered. “Most likely, he would try to fly and wet his pants or something. Who thinks like this?”",culture
"How do you turn a handful of lip-sync videos on TikTok into a Netflix special? That’s the challenge faced by US comic Sarah Cooper, who made her name this year miming online to the words of Donald Trump. The trick drew tighter focus on just how weird the president’s speech (and his ideas) can be, with only the subtlest of send-ups required from Cooper – a changed context here, a glimpse of fleeting hysteria behind the eyes there. The hysteria is ratcheted up in Everything’s Fine, a faux morning news broadcast spliced with a psycho-absurdist trepan into the overheated mind of 2020 America. It torpedoes any concerns that Cooper might be merely a lip-sync novelty – although the lip-syncing does feature, notably in the scorching scene that brings Trump’s “pussy-grabbing” dialogue to gender-bending life. Helen Mirren, of all people, co-stars, as Trump’s wingman Billy Bush, among a hatful of glitzy stars that includes Ben Stiller as a robot CEO, Whoopi Goldberg and Marisa Tomei as Satan. Satan, you say? Yup, this is no ordinary newscast. For a while, it might be: it’s comedy first-base to send up the dorky content and Day-Glo smiles of daytime TV, as Cooper seems to be doing. But soon there’s more going on, from the news-will-eat-itself item reporting on (and interacting with) Trump’s tweets in real-time, to the Get Out sketch imagining Mar-a-Lago’s only black clientele. Cooper’s gaze isn’t confined to politics: there’s a droll sketch of a close-up magician struggling to entertain her Covid-safe drive-in audience. But the sinister keeps encroaching. On the shopping channel run by conspiracy nuts QAnon, you can bid now for a porcelain Ivanka Trump doll with Cooper’s panicky face superimposed. “If being complicit,” it intones, “is wanting to be a force for good and make a positive impact, then I’m complicit”. It’s a fever dream, then, of this tumultuous American moment, a vortex of murder hornets, racist cupcakes and gassed protestors into which Cooper and her vacuous bulletin finally collapse. Truly the anchor’s away – further and further away – in this often funny, always striking document of what living feels like in this fraught and febrile year.",culture
"The first time I went to see it I think I had just turned 11 [Titanic had a 12 certificate]. I remember sneaking into the cinema for my birthday and my dad telling me and my friends how to act in front of the staff. He said: “If they ask you your birth date, you have to pretend it’s this day.” We watched the whole film and everybody was crying. My dad always tells the story of having these five 11-year-olds sobbing next to him. Really, it was my first emotional reaction to a romantic story. From then on, me and my friends got completely obsessed. We started collecting magazine cutouts of Leonardo, Kate Winslet, anything to do with Titanic. And then we studied the history of the Titanic. It just went on and on and on. Some friends were trading Spice Girls cards, but me and my other friends were just trading articles. It really went quite deep. Mariah Carey was my first musical obsession. My dad gave me the album Music Box when I was seven. I thought she was really beautiful and the artwork was brilliant. The first song I ever learned was her rendition of Without You. That’s the first time my dad said: “Oh, I think you’re quite good at singing.” I thought: “Wow, I’m going to be a singer!” After that, he was coaching me on how to convey emotion with my hands. He had me touching doorframes. It’s just so funny thinking of the seven-year-old me trying to convey the emotion of this desperate love song to my parents. My dad only showed me the biggest divas as I was growing up. He made it such a normal thing for me that a woman can sing, but also that it’s a requirement to write your own music. Having that in my head has kept me on the songwriting path. Now I look back and think, God, I’m so lucky that my parents had good taste in music, or knew what would excite a kid. I didn’t really get to see many people of colour on TV growing up. I think I saw Eternal on Live & Kicking or some other Saturday morning TV programme. I thought they were amazing. They were the first live act I ever went to see. It must have been 1995. It was in Aberdeen, in a small venue on top of Union Street. My sister was only a baby and fell asleep during the concert. It was such a brilliant night and my mum knew how excited I was to see it. I was in love with them and continued to be as their careers went on. When I did a show in the O2, Vernie [Bennett, one of the members] and her family came to watch. That was really exciting. This film changed my perspective. Being black and growing up in Scotland, it was always through different music or films that I could jigsaw bits of my identity together, even if they showed a completely different reality. I mean, New York is very far from Aberdeen. But Save the Last Dance gave me so many cultural references and I felt as if I belonged to a new kind of world that they portrayed. It influenced a lot of my fashion – my friends and I got bucket hats and Timberlands, New York streetwear, which you can imagine stood out quite a lot. It made me see that music can be this incredible communication between people from so many different walks of life. It made me dream a bit bigger and bolder with what I was doing. At 12 or 13, I was very shy and spent so much time alone, practising my music. I found this music community online. The cool thing was that you could use audio. Today we have WhatsApp and all of this amazing technology, but at the time, the fact that you could hear somebody from the other side of the world blew my mind. I was speaking to people in Cleveland, Ohio, and New York. I spent hours on this thing, it was so unhealthy! Going into these chat rooms was a way that I could test my chops a little bit: am I a good singer compared with somebody who is studying or singing in New York? What do they think of my voice? It was nerve-racking. There were so many voices that blew me away. I learned a lot about gospel music. I’m still friends with a lot of those people now; we’ve just switched over to Instagram. I’m not sure if Lauryn Hill counts as neo-soul because she’s such a mix of everything. But if she does count then she’s definitely my favourite neo-soul singer. I loved Jill Scott too. I first heard her on Trevor Nelson’s Rhythm Nation on Radio 1. I got such an education listening to that show. About twice a month, I’d spend lots of money ordering American import CDs of people I heard on it, such as Jaheim, Lauryn, Jill. I learned so much about myself through listening to neo-soul. Jill Scott really influenced how I approach music – the storytelling aspect of it. She had so much character and charisma in her lyrics. There was so much jazz influence in what she was doing, and she was such a beautiful, confident woman. And Erykah Badu’s Mama’s Gun blew my mind when I first heard it – the way she pieced that album together is genius. D’Angelo’s Voodoo is one of my favourite albums of all time. I remember one summer trying to learn how to beatbox like in Musiq Soulchild’s I Just Want to Sing. I remember listening to Floetry, too. The fact they were from the UK was so inspiring. I got to sing with the Floacist a couple of years ago. It was so nice to connect with a teenage hero. I really hope there’s a neo-soul resurgence, because I think it was such a classy, dignified genre of music that so many stories can be told through.",culture
"In the red corner: Joan Crawford, who put rocks in her pockets in preparation for a scene in which Davis had to drag her across a floor in the film Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? In the blue corner: Bette Davis, who said: “[Joan] slept with every male star at MGM except Lassie.” There were no winners in this bitter feud, stoked by an industry that saw women as washed up by 30, but their pranks and putdowns were top-drawer. Heavy metal lunkhead locks horns with grunge gloomster, with undignified results. After Nirvana declined to open for Guns N’ Roses on their 1992 tour, a squabble ensued that culminated in a face-off at 1992’s MTV Video Music awards, during which Rose told Cobain to “shut your bitch up”, referring to the latter’s wife, Courtney Love. The sibling rivalry between these writers was fostered by their mother, who encouraged them to compete as children. As an adult, Drabble took umbrage at Byatt’s portrayal of warring sisters in The Game, while Byatt sulked at Drabble’s depiction of their mother in The Peppered Moth. The actors put on brave faces during their Sex and the City years, despite rumours that they were at war, but the cracks have since begun to show. In 2018, following the death of Cattrall’s brother, Jessica Parker sent her condolences, for which she was rewarded with a ferocious dressing down from Cattrall via Instagram. Memes followed, obviously. This spat between the US literary giants, prompted by Vidal’s unflattering comments about Mailer’s book The Prisoner of Sex, turned physical when Mailer headbutted Vidal in 1971. Six years later, Mailer lamped him again, prompting Gore’s immortal burn: “As usual, words fail him.” It began with Minaj liking an Instagram comment that seemed to poke fun at fellow rapper Cardi B, and continued with a series of lyrical disses. Later came a scuffle at a New York fashion week party, when a shoe was thrown and Cardi left sporting a bump on her head. All was not well on the set of the 1957 romantic comedy film The Prince and the Showgirl, where Olivier failed to hide his disdain for his co-star, despite acting being his actual job. While Monroe maintained a dignified silence, Olivier said of Monroe: “My hatred for her was one of the strongest emotions I had ever felt.” There has been bad blood between these two ever since West crashed Swift’s acceptance speech at 2009’s MTV Video Music awards. An apology followed, but their ruck was reignited with the song Famous, in which West made disparaging remarks about Swift. Kim Kardashian, wife of Kanye, later claimed that Swift had approved the lyric and called her a snake, an image the singer cannily adopted for her Reputation tour. Rolling pins at dawn! When Stewart – an author, entrepreneur and lifestyle guru – took a potshot at Paltrow for “trying to be Martha Stewart” with her company Goop, the actor didn’t take it lying down. Paltrow subsequently posted a recipe for “jailbird cake” on her website, a not-at-all-veiled reference to Stewart’s five-month stint behind bars in 2004. The beef between the 90s rappers was sparked when Shakur accused Smalls of organising a shooting at his studio. Various diss tracks followed, including Biggie’s Who Shot Ya? and Tupac’s Hit ’Em Up. Events took a shocking turn when Shakur was shot dead in 1996, and Smalls was shot six months later. Both murders remain unsolved.",culture
"Artist Ralph Steadman’s work became synonymous with 70s counterculture due to his long association with the gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson. His distinctive political and satirical drawings have appeared in the New York Times, Punch and Rolling Stone. Steadman has created album artwork for the Who and Frank Zappa, designed an award-winning set of British stamps and illustrated special editions of Alice in Wonderland, Animal Farm and Fahrenheit 451. A retrospective artbook, A Life in Ink, is out this month.  Reluctant Genius: Alexander Graham Bell and the Passion for Invention by Charlotte GrayI much prefer to read about real people’s lives rather than fiction. Currently I’m reading this biography by Canadian author Charlotte Gray. It seems to have won a lot of awards, which I usually think are badges of mediocrity, but this is rather good – very well written and researched. Bell was a fascinating man and invented so much more than the telephone. A lot of his work involved sound, including sonar probes and fibre optics. This biography really brings him to life. Freak Power: The Ballot Or the Bomb I’ve just watched this excellent documentary by Daniel Watkins and Ajax Phillips. It’s about Hunter S Thompson’s political campaign to become sheriff of Pitkin County in 1970. All of the footage featured in this was only recently discovered and hasn’t been seen before. Watching it really took me back. What got me about the film was its representation of Hunter’s humour, that’s how I remember him. His manifesto of legalising marijuana, disarming the police and protecting the environment doesn’t seem so far out today. Those crooked Aspen politicians would fit right in as well. Ozgur in Tenterden This Turkish restaurant is in Tenterden, near where I live in Kent. Ozgur is a family tradition – we’ve been going there for around 30 years, for all our celebrations and birthdays. I love the fact that it’s been there so long that it’s become part of a wonderful community. Mustafa, who runs the joint, knows all the other shop owners along the high street, and eating there in the summer on the pavement outside you could hear everyone talking to each other up and down the street. I really like the liver and onions – an old-fashioned dish that my father used to love. Just a Minute, Radio 4 Radio 4 and the World Service play all through the night and most of the day in my house. It’s a soothing background and nice to wake up to. There was a special evening of programmes about Nicholas Parsons recently on Radio 4 that was just lovely. Parsons was such a nice, self-effacing man, but had an interesting life. Just a Minute, which Parsons hosted, is one of my favourite shows. Paul Merton is very witty and I love Sheila Hancock – she’s hilariously funny and quick. The Repair Shop I’m fascinated by this BBC show about experts restoring family treasures and heirlooms. How these craftspeople make things work is just incredible. I get so engrossed watching them work. I particularly like upholstery restorer Sonnaz Nooranvary, who does the sewing and restores old pieces of material. She puts the glow back into these things – you literally see this glow appear. I love watching skill in action. I have such respect for expertise. Outdoor swimming I hate sport but I love to swim. I have an outdoor pool – it’s not a far shore, but it’s been terrific for swimming in lockdown and I haven’t missed a day all year. That’s been one good thing about this germ-riddled limbo we’re in. I’ve swum all my life, since the cold, pebbly beach at Abergele in north Wales where I grew up, and Rhyl swimming baths. I really like doing the breaststroke. It’s good for the sternum and I like the feeling of your chest pressing against the water.

"When it was first suggested to Yuval Noah Harari that he appear as a character in the illustrated version of Sapiens, his mega-bestselling “brief history of humankind”, which is about to be published in graphic form, he did not jump at the idea. “I vetoed it,” he says over the phone from his home outside Tel Aviv. “I try to keep myself mostly outside my books.” Sapiens covers the broad arc of our species’ story, from the emergence of human cultures in Africa 70,000 years ago to our hyper-connected present, in 500 pages. It has been one of the most spectacular publishing successes of the past decade, selling more than 10m copies since it was translated into English in 2014, and its enormous popularity has turned a little-known Israeli history professor into one of the most influential public intellectuals on the planet. But for all his ambition and influence, Harari cuts a rather sober figure. Slim, bespectacled and shaven-headed, he speaks softly but insistently not just about our distant past but also of the near future of humanity and the various existential threats looming. “If Harari weren’t always out in public,” a New Yorker profile noted earlier this year, “one might mistake him for a recluse.” So it’s curious to see the 44-year-old appearing in Sapiens: A Graphic History, serving as an avuncular cartoon tour guide through the early days of humanity. On the opening page he greets us from an armchair, book open on his lap, ready for story-time; later he leads a fictional niece through the complexities of evolution and his theories on how an obscure savannah-dwelling ape rose to world domination. His co-authors on the new book, the French illustrator Daniel Casanave and Belgian scriptwriter David Vandermeulen, insisted Harari step into the frame. “They convinced me it’s a very efficient storytelling technique, and that it would make it easier to convey at least some of the messages if you have this guide who accompanies the reader.”  As a compromise, they agreed to include a cast of scientists “who could explain different disciplines and present different theories – it’s important to show science as a collaborative effort and not as an individual enterprise,” says Harari. Some, such as the Oxford anthropologist Robin Dunbar, a specialist in primate behaviour, are real figures who have shaped Harari’s thinking; but most are fictional. Among the cast are a masked superhero, Doctor Fiction, who personifies “the human superpower to create and believe in fictional stories”, and a hard-boiled New York detective “investigating who killed most of the big animals of the planet more than 10,000 years ago”. (Spoiler: it was us.) Sapiens grew out of an undergraduate lecture series on world history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where Harari still teaches, before becoming a bestseller in Israel in 2011. “The core ideas have remained the same” with each new adaptation, says Harari, though the illustrated version did give him “the opportunity to rethink some of the details – science has discovered a lot of new things over the past decade and a half”. It also challenged Harari to flesh out some of his original observations. “Texts can be very abstract, but when you draw, you have to be concrete,” he says. “So, for example, if you discuss sexual relations between Sapiens and Neanderthals, in a text you can avoid the question of, was it a Sapiens man with a Neanderthal woman or the other way around? What did they look like? It forces you to go back to the scientific research. And of course, it brings up a lot of issues, ideological and political, about race and gender. Even if you don’t have all the facts, you need to make a call. Some of the liveliest debates that we had were exactly about such issues.” Sapiens has already reached tens of millions of readers across nearly 50 languages. Now, in addition to the illustrated version, which will unfold over four volumes, Harari – who last year founded a social-impact company called Sapienship with his husband and agent-manager Itzik Yahav – is planning a history of the world for younger children; there is also talk of a TV adaptation of Sapiens and a touring exhibit. What is it about the book’s message that he feels is so urgent to get to an even wider audience? “I think it answers a crucial need,” he says. “Because we live in a global world, you need a big-picture understanding of history now to really understand your own life. Most educational systems basically just teach you the history of your country, your religion, your culture. I went through 12 years in Israeli schools and never heard a thing about the history of China, or about anything prior to Judaism. I don’t think I had a single lesson about the agricultural revolution. So people need this big picture, and Sapiens provides it in a way which we tried very hard to make accessible and interesting and fun.” Accessibility is key here. “When you look at what’s happening now in the world with Covid-19, and all the conspiracy theories, you see the importance of science reaching not just a small elite, but everybody,” he says. “One big handicap is that science is usually much more complicated than the conspiracy theories, and scientists often speak in jargon and numbers and statistics and graphs, which most people find difficult – people usually think in stories.” In the graphic version, “we remain faithful to the core scientific facts and theories, but we can experiment with new ways of telling the story, and thereby reach a wider audience.” Harari is aware that the success of his books has led some people to view him as a prophet, which makes him uneasy. “I keep saying, ‘I don’t know what’s going to happen.’ The whole point of writing books is to try to change the future, not to predict it.” However, he admits he feels fearful about what lies ahead. “In the long span of history, the Black Death and the influenza of 1918-19 were much worse. [Covid-19] is a relatively mild epidemic in terms of mortality. Its most dangerous potential is its impact on our ability to deal with other threats. Nuclear war, ecological collapse and the rise of disruptive technologies like AI – these three threats can really destroy human civilisation if we don’t handle them correctly. And all three demand global cooperation to deal with them. If we react in the wrong way to the present crisis, it will destroy whatever remains of global cooperation; it will create a poor, violent world, which will not be able to have a common plan of action against global warming or how to regulate the explosive potential of AI. That’s the most dangerous outcome of all this.”",culture
"There are two versions of the comic Rob Brydon: Television Personality and Twickenham Dad. And although the two identities have lived hugger-mugger inside him for decades, occasionally overlapping, “like tectonic plates”, says the 55-year-old, they are rarely seen out in public at the same time. I’m lucky this afternoon that I get to meet both Brydons: the performer, who is polished and smiley if a touch remote, as well as the softer, more relatable father-of-five. It’s Twickenham Dad I meet first. When I come up on Brydon on a London street he is peering through the window of a home-furnishing showroom, taking pictures of a nice bit of garden furniture that’s caught his eye. This furniture looks to be hewn out of stone and (we both note) has no obvious price tag. “So whatever you think it costs,” says Brydon, in his measured and pleasing Port Talbot accent, “add lots of zeroes on.” He is wearing a fitted, felty suit and has his charcoal hair neatly parted. The enduringly youthful face, lightly scarred from teenage battles with acne, is mostly covered by a pale pandemic mask. He removes the mask once we’re seated in a nextdoor restaurant. Angling his thick-framed bifocals, Brydon studies the menu, taking an age to choose and dramatising his indecision for the waiter’s amusement. “Who knows!” he is muttering. “I might treat myself to a little pudding. That changes, as you get older, your love of puddings. Oh! There’s too much that looks lovely. Make a decision, man. OK. The seabream. The seabream, please. The seabream.” He’s hungry, having woken early this morning to appear on breakfast TV, there to talk up a live tour (due to start next spring) and a series of YouTube interviews he has recorded with friends and colleagues from the entertainment industry. It occurs to me, listening to Brydon’s twinkly and enjoyable anecdotes about dawn wake-up calls, soundchecks, unintentionally patronising producers, that breakfast telly is about the only job in showbiz he hasn’t tried over a multi-decade career. To date, Brydon has starred in influential British sitcoms that are mainstream (Gavin & Stacey), niche (Marion & Geoff) and deep niche (Human Remains). At the start he was a radio presenter, then a shopping-channel presenter, then a quiz-show presenter, then the disembodied voice on the Beeb who said chirpy and forgettable things between the end of the news and the start of Match of the Day. For decades, he has narrated ads, for soft drinks, for breakfast cereals. In his new YouTube series he revisits a skill for interviewing that he first developed as host of the Wogan-like Rob Brydon Show, which ran between 2010 and 2013. He currently helms a comedy panel show, Would I Lie To You? and over the years he has toured (in and out of character) as a standup, a musician, and a musician who does standup between songs. Since 2010, Brydon has improvised his way through four series of The Trip, an intense two-hander, co-starring Steve Coogan and devised by director Michael Winterbottom, that is one of the most interesting, infuriating, sustainedly weird creative projects in recent TV history. Oh, and Brydon does impersonations, too. “Gotta-find-the-monkey, gotta-find-the-monkey,” he is saying at the restaurant table, pretending to be Dustin Hoffman in the 1995 virus movie, Outbreak. “Hruff! Hruff! Hruff!” he says, impersonating Boris Johnson as part of a story about the time he met the Prime Minister in a corridor. “It was at a thing, a party. We were passing.” Instead of any sort of conventional greeting, Brydon recalls Johnson pointed a finger at his chest and said the word “funny” several times. “I think I nodded. I can’t remember what I said, but I didn’t stick around, because I didn’t want to… I didn’t want to, um… I suppose I didn’t want to be charmed by him, if I’m going to tell the truth.” Brydon frowns. Typically he steers clear of political chat. A look at his 2021 tour schedule might explain why: this comic has broad, cross-demographic appeal and out on the road he’ll be visiting more Brexit- and Boris-voting constituencies than not. Anyway, something about the way the government botched the closure of theatres at the start of lockdown really irked him. Brydon was on tour at the time, warming up in Guildford when Johnson held that notorious press conference in late March, “the one where he recommended people didn’t go to the theatre, he didn’t say they couldn’t go. (At the time this was felt a cowardly move, potentially blocking insurance payouts.) It put venues in a dreadful position,” says Brydon. He remembers having to tell the band of musicians he was travelling with that their weeks-long tour was off. He gets tearful talking about it now. “I could see it in their faces. They were thinking of the loss of income. It was sobering. Really sobering.” In the manner of a fellow-traveller, Brydon will acknowledge that Johnson (“Let’s not call him Boris, please, because it softens him, like all the Wodehouseian nonsense that he does”) was a decent TV comic himself, back when he would occasionally host panel shows. “Johnson was good on TV. He should have stayed there. On TV? Fill your boots, good for you, have all the character flaws you want. But not in the slightly more important job you occupy now, please.” As a boy growing up in Swansea and later Port Talbot, Brydon would sing along to David Bowie in the family car. “It’s a god-awful small affair…” One day his mother, a teacher, interrupted him: “It may well be. But we won’t have that kind of language here.” He had half an eye on London and at 18 he travelled there to audition for Rada. He performed a piece from The Homecoming, but it didn’t land and he crept away defeated. Years later, spotting Harold Pinter in a restaurant, he approached the notoriously touchy playwright and risked a joke. “I can’t help thinking that if you’d tried a little bit harder with the writing, things might have been different for me.” Pinter, to Brydon’s terrific relief, chuckled. He was always good at making people laugh. Accepted into another drama college, in Cardiff, he remembers being picked out by his peers as “the funny one. I can’t overstate how much I thought I would do when I began.” In fact, Brydon left college early to work in radio. Through his 20s he “scrabbled around” on the fringes of the industry. He was married with three children when, in 1996, he auditioned for Spitting Image and got down to the last three, no further. For the most part, “I couldn’t get in the door of casting rooms. All I had to offer was little parts in sitcoms that amounted to nothing; little parts that a nice well-trained Labrador could have played.” He recalls an evening at home in the mid-1990s, when he was watching BBC2 and he saw Coogan as Alan Partridge in an early episode of Knowing Me, Knowing You. “I got off the sofa and I knelt, to be closer to the TV. I knew how good this was.” A few years later it seemed miraculous when a tape he’d made of himself performing character sketches found its way into Coogan’s hands. Coogan wound up producing two comedy series featuring Brydon: first Marion & Geoff (co-created with Hugo Blick) and then Human Remains (co-created with Julia Davis). There was another kneel-on-the-floor moment, in 2000, when Marion & Geoff broadcast to genuine acclaim on BBC2. “It changed everything. I was 35. My contemporaries had soared past me.” Now he was felt to be a rising star. And he was buds with Alan Partridge. “I was quite green at the time. I think I was quite provincial. I’m quite a late developer. Physically and, I don’t know, emotionally maybe? When I first met Steve it was very much as a fan. I remember, first hanging out with him, my frustration at his reluctance to engage in anything comedic. This man with these prodigious gifts! I would want to do bits with him. And he’d never do bits. He’s not one of those guys.” Brydon is one of those guys. As an interviewer you come to recognise his comedy bits tend to intrude whenever he wants to speed through or skirt an awkward discussion point. We’re talking about what it was like to experience seismic upheaval during his 30s. (By 2006, Brydon was divorced and married to Clare Holland, with whom he has had two more children.) I say something careless about starting life all over again and Brydon adopts the persona of a Welsh schoolmaster, maybe one played by Anthony Hopkins, to chastise me. “Now, what you’ve done there,” says Brydon-as-Hopkins, lowering his head and pressing his hands together, “is you’ve assumed life is like this… [his hands come apart and he makes a soft percussive noise, like a bomb exploding] When in fact life is like this… [he slides his hands apart more gently]. Life evolves. It’s a slow shifting. So I wouldn’t say I started life again at 35. My first marriage ended. But it wasn’t this… [exploding hands]. It was this… [sliding hands]. As sensitive, and as untraumatic, as we could make it.” It was around then that Brydon put in a career-shaping performance as Uncle Bryn in two series of Gavin & Stacey. The culture-clash sitcom was created by Ruth Jones and James Corden, who wrote Brydon’s part with him in mind. Jones is from the same part of Wales as him and they had crossed paths as secondary-school kids, when they appeared together in amateur musicals. To this day, Brydon says, “If you put us together, we will sing.” This singing of theirs caused an uncomfortable ruckus last Christmas when the cast of Gavin & Stacey regathered for a seasonal episode watched by more than 17m people. Brydon’s character and Jones’s were in a karaoke scene in which they had to sing the Pogues song, Fairytale of New York. The uncut version of the song is considered inappropriate, by many, for its inclusion of a homophobic insult. In the version Brydon and Jones recorded they did not edit out the insult. (PinkNews: “More Than a Quarter of the Population Spent Their Christmas Watching Rob Brydon Unnecessarily Sing a Homophobic Slur”.) Jones has since made a persuasive case that it was all a matter of creative honesty. “We had to remain true to the characters,” she told the Sun. “And they’re not necessarily going to be completely politically correct.” I ask Brydon what he made of it. He says: “That’s the world we live in now. So you’ve got to be able to take it. It’s their opinion.” Ruth Jones was a guest on his new YouTube show and during their conversation Brydon described the filming of the Pogues song as one of the more emotional moments of his life. He had his childhood mate dueting beside him. And his eldest daughter was on set too, there as an extra… I ask him whether the subsequent upheaval changed or coloured that happy memory. “The filming happened in the summer. The fuss happened at Christmas, five months later,” he says. “The experience of doing it is wholly separate from the experience of how it’s perceived. And how it’s perceived depends entirely on who is perceiving it. So no.” Plates are arriving from the kitchen. First zucchini, then seabream, and several bowls of buttered sides. Of course, it brings to mind The Trip, so much of which featured lingering scenes of Brydon enjoying lavish meals. (And in storyline terms it was meant to be the Observer Magazine picking up all the bills.) When Winterbottom first pitched him and Coogan the idea in the late 00s, “We turned it down three times.” A pair of middle-aged men, playing lightly fictionalised versions of themselves, bickering over their food? “We said: ‘We can’t. There’s not enough to it.’” But Brydon remembers getting home from the first week of shooting and telling his wife: it might be all right. I think it has become Brydon’s best work, evolving from a sort of high-budget travelogue into a uniquely paced rumination on ageing and ambition, a study in friendship and rivalry that’s sometimes been unbearably raw. Because the same format is repeated endlessly – Brydon and Coogan veer between good-natured competitiveness (Who has the better mastery of obscure trivia? Who can do the better impersonations?) and reasonably serious personal attacks (Who has had the better career? Who has fashioned for themselves the better life?) – the show has come to have the depth of a novel. We can safely say, after a decade of episodes, that neither actor comes away looking especially sympathetic. We know we’ve been watching fictionalised reality, I say to Brydon. But, even so, it’s hard for the viewer not to carry away lingering impressions. That both of you use your comic personas as shields. And that you, Rob, are a little more…. “Go on,” says Brydon. “A little more what?” Relentless? “You mean with the impersonations and things? That’s Michael Winterbottom! He’s always saying, ‘Do another voice, do another voice.’ I’m fond of funny voices, but I certainly wouldn’t behave like I do in the show, not in a million years.” Brydon frowns. “Look, I don’t under-estimate the effect this programme has had on people, and how they form their opinions about me. But it doesn’t bother me. I don’t think it harms me. I can’t control it. So who cares?” In his industry, he says, he meets a lot of obsessional people, people who are driven in a way that he can’t fully identify with. “When I hear them talking about their new projects, y’know, that they’re ‘so into’, I want to tell them: ‘Do the work! Put it out there! Wonderful! But I don’t want to hear about it.’ The work should be over there…” Brydon waves a hand towards the far corner of the restaurant. (And with this, once and for all, the Television Personality part of him is dismissed from the table. Twickenham Dad, his smartphone full of pictures of patio furniture, will handle the rest of the interview.) “And over here you’re a chap who lives in a house with a wife and two children, and three more children scattered around in their endeavours, and you’ve got a cat, and a hamster, and that’s what matters… The way I think of my position in the industry, I don’t need to be Steve, or Ricky [Gervais], or Sacha [Baron Cohen], these explosive perkow guys. I’m pretty happy. I know that’s a bit dull. I know that’s a bit ‘meh’, as people say. But I’ve got five kids. My head can’t be everywhere. Does that explain it?” Yes, I say. “I love doing this job. I want to keep doing it.” We’re looking around for the waiter. “ But that’s about it. The work is there. We’re here.” So, he wonders, reading the clock on his phone, and glancing around for the waiter – do we have time for pudding?

"Opera Australia will launch its summer season on Thursday, still reeling from a turbulent past six weeks that saw the company hit with a slew of unfair dismissal cases, and its orchestra deliver a vote of no confidence in its concertmaster. Guardian Australia has learned that – in a bid to stop the forced redundancies of almost one-third of the Opera Australia orchestra’s 56 full-time employees – the musicians took the unprecedented step of holding a confidential ballot on 25 September to signal to management its unwillingness to continue working with the concertmaster and orchestra director Jun Yi Ma. According to the orchestra’s now-redundant principal clarinettist, Peter Jenkin, the musicians’ revolt was fuelled by anger at Ma’s alleged participation on a four-member panel that was formed to decide who to sack. The motion of no confidence, which has been seen by Guardian Australia, noted that such a course of action had not been taken lightly. “It is devastating that we find ourselves in this situation, but unfortunately Jun has demonstrated through his actions that his position as our leader is now untenable,” the motion reads. “Specifically, his role in the redundancies, his unwillingness or inability to communicate support to his colleagues, his unwillingness to meet with player reps, and his active attempts to undermine [the union] MEAA’s campaign to save the positions, make it clear that we cannot continue to support him.” As concertmaster, one of Ma’s roles is to be chief intermediary in any contentious issue between the players and a conductor, or company management. But his additional title of orchestra director – not a common title found in opera orchestras – appears to have placed Ma firmly in the managerial camp. The company’s chief executive, Rory Jeffes, was informed of the vote of no confidence – signed almost unanimously, sources told the Guardian – but the motion was never formally tabled to management. An OA spokeswoman declined to comment on the no-confidence motion, but told the Guardian the continuing Covid-19 crisis forced the company into making redundancies. “They were very difficult decisions for all involved and certainly not made lightly,” she said in a statement. The shortfall in players will be filled by casual freelance musicians, possibly including some of those who were only recently made redundant. In the face of a protracted shutdown brought on by Covid-19 in March, Opera Australia’s board approved cuts to all permanent positions across creative, technical and administrative operations in August, without the opportunity for voluntary redundancies. The bulk of remaining staff were placed on jobkeeper, and the company set in motion preparations to sell its Sydney warehouse in Alexandria and much of its contents, including costumes and props. By the end of November, the orchestra will meet as a whole for the first time in more than six months to begin rehearsals for the 2021 summer season. Its size will have shrunk by almost one-third, and the musicians will be squaring off with a concertmaster many may no longer wish to work with. “There is an expectation that a concertmaster goes in to bat for his musicians,” Jenkin told Guardian Australia. “If he was pushed into a corner [by management] to sit on that panel, then the right thing to do would have been resign, not move against his own orchestra.” Another musician, whose position was not cancelled and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said management had placed Ma in an impossible position. “He wears two hats, and as orchestra director he had no option but to participate,” the musician said. “But that doesn’t change people’s feelings of anger and disappointment in him.” Oboist Mark Bruwel, who had been with the orchestra for more than 30 years before being dismissed on 25 September, said there were deep concerns over the lack of transparency in the mass forced redundancy procedure. As president of the Symphony Orchestra Musicians Association [Soma] up until September and a former member of the orchestra’s work health and safety committee, Bruwel told Guardian Australia some musicians, including himself, believed they were sacked because of their union activities. “There is no doubt in my mind that people who were outspoken on issues were targeted in the elimination process,” he said. Jenkin, a musicians’ representative on the MEAA’s federal council, told Guardian Australia his case to the Fair Work Commission would argue that his dismissal was based in part on his union membership. The OA spokeswoman denied claims that redundancies were motivated by union activities of their members. “Decisions regarding these redundancies were solely based on the positions required by Opera Australia into the future in responding to this once-in-a-century crisis,” she said. “We appreciate the significant role that the union plays in the organisation and respect and support our employees’ rights to be a member of the union. “We consider that we enjoy a positive and productive relationship with the union and are continuing to work with them during these difficult times.” Jenkin and Bruwel are among as many as nine redundant OA musicians, choristers and crew who have so far brought cases of unfair dismissal against the company in the Fair Work Commission, with hearings beginning next week. On Monday, the federal arts minister, Paul Fletcher, met with Jeffes and the OA chair, David Mortimer, to discuss the company’s financial predicament. “Opera Australia, like many other institutions across the nation, is facing difficult decisions in response to Covid-19,” Fletcher told the Guardian. “While these decisions are for the board and management, the loss of any Australian job is always regrettable.” OA will receive $21.853m in recurrent federal funding in 2020 and that support would continue into 2021, he said. The Guardian has been given a copy of an email that was sent to OA staff – including the 16 musicians it had sacked – on Wednesday. The email called for expressions of interest to fill at least 13 newly vacated “temporary” positions in the orchestra, across woodwind, string, brass and percussion. The MEAA’s director for musicians, Paul Davies, told the Guardian the company was now scrambling to fill the very positions it purported were redundant in September. “There appears to be no real change to the operating model as claimed, but rather a brazen strategy to casualise the workforce and reduce wages and conditions,” Davies said. OA’s spokeswoman told Guardian Australia on Monday that previous OA employees were welcome “and indeed have been encouraged, to apply for any vacant seasonal positions that become available in the future”. Federal Labor’s arts spokesman, Tony Burke, said OA management needed to explain itself. “[They] should explain why just a few weeks after sacking permanent performers they’re now hiring temporary replacements,” Burke told Guardian Australia. “Arts workers deserve the same job security as anyone else.” Bruwel said he believed that Opera Australia “had committed an act of cultural vandalism” on the orchestra and the company’s chorus and crew. “There was an ideological as well as a financial agenda and [OA] very much took advantage of Covid-19 to run it.”",culture
"A beam of light shoots across the gallery space, projecting a series of zoomorphic figures onto a grainy, red surface. A dugong, a turtle, a fish and a small kangaroo glisten in the dark, barely distinguishable, as you might expect of artworks that are some 50,000 years old. These are the Dreaming stories of the Ngarda-Ngarli people of Murujuga country, also known as the Burrup Peninsula, which is home to the world’s largest concentration of petroglyphic rock art. “The rocks, they are alive,” says Yindjibarndi elder Tootsie Daniel of Murujuga, where three billion-year-old rock formations meet the vast Indian ocean. “They speak to us. They are living stories.” Tootsie is among more than 54,000 Western Australians whose “living stories” are weaved through the WA Museum Boola Bardip, which reopened on Saturday after a $400 million, four-year redevelopment. The perspectives of more than 70 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language groups are featured throughout the museum, an approach known as “two-eyed seeing”, where western and Indigenous knowledge are placed on equal footing. “I’m not aware of any other museum in the world that has surveyed this many people,” says Alec Coles, chief executive officer of Boola Bardip, which translates to “many stories” in Whadjuk Nyoongar. “We made a commitment from the very beginning to represent many diverse voices, many of whom had never been heard, let alone in this kind of institution.” Among the museum’s eight permanent exhibitions are a bounty of rare and world-first artefacts, including the largest meteorite collection in the southern hemisphere, Australia’s oldest grape vine and largest whale skeleton. It also includes the largest pieces of banded iron ore formations in the world and microscopic single-celled organisms, which Boola Bardip’s project director, Trish McDonald, says are “some of the earliest evidence for the evolution of life on earth.” But it’s the multiplicity of stories and ideas, rather than the objects, that set this 6,000 square metre museum apart. In this era of post-truth, where science is often dismissed and alternative facts flagrantly offered, museums can play a vital role in promoting evidence-based knowledge, according to Coles. “Museums are places that people tend to trust, where you can have some of these difficult conversations without the rancour and the bias that you see elsewhere,” Coles continues. “Of course, there will be some people who are upset or incensed by what they see, people who are climate denialists, for example. But that’s exactly the point. We want to encourage critical reflection and debate, to be a conduit for real stories, for healing, and ultimately, for truth.” Perhaps the most interesting of these “difficult conversations” takes place in the Changes gallery, which explores how economic activity has impacted our natural resources and Indigenous heritage, posing the question: is “for the good of the state” good for everyone? As the world’s largest producer of both iron-ore and liquefied natural gas, where the logos of multinational explorers shout from skyscrapers and “did you see the iron-ore price today?” is standard water cooler chat, mining holds a firm place in Western Australia’s identity. As Bill Johnston, minister for mines and petroleum, states in a display within the Changes gallery, “Our capacity to function as a government is directly connected to the success of the iron ore industry and so is the entire nation.” But with incidents like Rio Tinto’s destruction of the sacred Aboriginal site Juukan Gorge in May, and warnings that 100 more sacred sites, some predating the ice age, could be next in the firing line, there are concerns about the sector’s disregard for cultural and environmental assets. On a screen we see footage of a massive train hurtling across the Pilbara carrying iron-ore, likely bound for China or Japan. It is overlaid with an audio of July Hicks, an Eastern Garuma elder: “They’re going to have nothing left,” she says. “Nothing left to say, ‘This is where your descendants came from, this is where your elders lived.’ Because of mining companies just destroying the land.” Like many Australian cultural institutions, Boola Bardip receives funding from a roll-call of resources companies, including Woodside, Rio Tinto and the Minderoo Foundation, owned by mining businessman Andrew Forrest. While Coles stresses these affiliations have no bearing on Boola Bardip’s content, saying that issues are presented “without fear or favour”, there is no mention of Rio Tinto’s Juukan Gorge blunder or Woodside’s “relocation” of more than 1,700 pieces of rock art into a holding compound for their North West Shelf Project in 2014. A little further up the hall, the Connections gallery explores WA as a multicultural state which has the largest overseas-born population in Australia. It introduces Alicia Freudenberg, who escaped persecution during Hitler’s reign, arriving in Perth on a summer’s day in 1939. “After what we had been through, it was wonderful,” she said. A didactic wall panel bearing the UN Declaration of Human Rights issues a timely reminder that “All human beings are born free”, before the gallery transitions into WA’s modern record on refugees. Conflicting attitudes towards migration are brandished on placards: “We are boat people” and “Assimilate or leave”, interspersed with stories of refugees who built a life here from scratch, and those who agonise over an uncertain future in offshore detention. And downstairs, in a temporary exhibition situated between the Innovations and Reflections galleries, another kind of uncertain future is explored: that of the Covid-19 pandemic. The displays chronicle premier Mark McGowan’s stewardship, including his notorious hard border stance, which has so far protected the state from a second wave. “Covid has created this incredible sense of community here,” Alec says. “The world has shifted so much under our feet. And when that happens, where do we turn? We turn to nature, we turn to culture, we turn to science.” “Our public cultural and scientific institutions have never been more important. And I feel very optimistic about that here in Western Australia.”",culture
"It may be true that John Sessions – or John Marshall, as he then was – found Canada “cold and depressing” when he was a graduate student at McMaster university in the 1970s, but he spread warmth and good cheer among students and faculty alike in the English department, which I chaired at that time. The one-man shows that he loved to put on for us – endlessly inventive, sharply satiric and very, very funny – soon drew audiences from across the university. One sketch I remember was of “Queen Lear” demanding access to her palaces for “me and my 100 corgis”. McMaster can claim to have given John scope to hone his unique skills. It also helped to redirect his career. Two leading lights of drama on campus, Liz and David Inman, propelled him in the direction of Rada and raised funds to support him in his first year in London.",culture
"What happens when an annoying narcissist has a spiritual awakening? Do they become different? Better? Or does real change require much more than learning how to meditate? Enlightened, starring Laura Dern, aired for two seasons on HBO from 2011 to 2013. Critics loved it, a third season was on the cards – but it never got the mainstream viewership it deserved and was cancelled due to poor ratings. Its biggest crime back then, it seems, was to be born too soon. Now streaming in Australia on Binge, it’s stood the test of time. When Enlightened first screened, streaming services were in their infancy and the TV landscape was more conservative and dominated by the risk-averse network model. These days female anti-heroes and shows that mash up comedy with drama are the norm. The premise is simple: a self-destructive woman, Amy Jellicoe (Dern), is having an affair with her boss and has a nervous breakdown at the office. A buyer at a major firm, she’s been demoted from health and beauty to the cleaning products department and is furious. When we meet Amy, she has mascara running down her cheeks, is crying in the toilets and then – with the strength that comes from sheer rage – manages to prise open the doors of an elevator to confront her cowardly boss. After taking a month out to attend a wellness retreat in Hawaii, she comes back enlightened and tranquil. Returning to the banally evil corporation where she once had an office and an assistant, Amy is working in the basement with all the other corporate misfits doing menial data entry work. Her enlightened state vanishes almost immediately. In many ways Enlightened depicts how humans are a work in progress. We might think we’ve changed, but a new challenge or an old trigger has the power to knock us back to our old selves. Dern plays a complicated character who is hard to like in the same way that Girls’ Hannah Horvath was. Amy means well, but the volume is up to 100 and she can’t read a room to save herself. Despite all the self-help books, her ego constantly gets in the way. She wants to save the world, but treats the people around her as expendable. She appears in some of her more obnoxious scenes like an early prototype of a Karen. Wanting to change the world doesn’t ease your character flaws. You may think you want to work at a homeless shelter (as Amy does in the first season) but you’ll still turn your nose up at the pay. This year Vox called Enlightened the stand-out performance of Dern’s career and the start of a run of excellent turns including in Big Little Lies and Marriage Story. The role of Amy was created especially for her by writer and co-star Mike White; it is Dern’s performance, and what she can do with her mobile face, that makes this show a must-watch. While Enlightened saves most of its satire for the corporate world, there is a more subtle critique of the wellness industry running through the two seasons. An idyllic (and expensive) retreat in Hawaii will take you away from your worries for a while, but it doesn’t take long for the glow to wear off. What these retreats often don’t prepare you for is life outside: your annoying co-worker (Mike White), your drug-addicted ex-husband (Luke Wilson), your beaten-down mother (played by Dern’s real life mother Diane Ladd). And they certainly won’t dismantle society’s social problems or structural inequalities. Over the two short seasons, Amy morphs not from loser to success story – or from unenlightened to spiritual – but from an individual seeking fulfilment to a social justice warrior who tries to change the system from within. That her quest and transformation happens while the character still remains annoying is part of the show’s intelligence – and its bravery. Viewers have become more accustomed to shows that deliver complex characters and more realistic endings. Here’s hoping Enlightened finds the audience it deserved the first time around.  Enlightened is now streaming on Binge ",culture
"America’s rates of coronavirus cases continue to soar above those of other developed nations such as Canada, Trevor Noah reported on Tuesday’s Daily Show, a dismal reality partly attributable to reports over the weekend of un-distanced “Covid parties”, church services without masks and a packed Chainsmokers concert in the Hamptons. “Obviously, ordinary Americans should be taking this pandemic more seriously,” said Noah. “But in their defense, it’s hard to do that when this is the guy who’s setting the tone from the top.” Noah referred to Donald Trump’s retweeting earlier this week of a coronavirus conspiracy video inaccurately claiming hydroxychloroquine – that old friend – as a cure for the virus. Twitter subsequently flagged and removed the video, which featured Dr Stella Immanuel, a physician in Texas with, as reported by the Daily Beast, a long history of propagating bizarre, untruthful and anti-LGBTQ medical claims, such as that gynecological conditions like endometriosis are caused by people having sex in their dreams with witches or demons. “Yes, despite having the world’s top doctors at his disposal,” said Noah, “Trump has decided instead to trust a doctor who believes that people get sick because they masturbate and that vaccines are made from alien DNA. “And by the way, whatever you do, please don’t start running around saying that African doctors are crazy,” he added. (Immanuel was born in Cameroon and received her medical degree in Nigeria.) “This doctor, who’s from Africa, happens to be crazy. You can’t use her to judge all African doctors, the same way you wouldn’t want the world to judge America’s presidents based on one guy, would you?” Basically, America “has two choices right now”, Noah concluded. We can “limit the spread of corona by following the science” or “listen to the advice of internet randos like Dr Demon Sperm”. Jimmy Fallon also dug into the president’s misinformation campaign on Tuesday night. “In 14 tweets, Trump undermined Dr Fauci, dismissed face masks and boasted about hydroxychloroquine working again,” the Tonight Show host said of Trump’s Monday night Twitter spree. “What is he doing? Even flat-earthers think this guy is out of his mind. “It’s like Crazy Trump was away for a week, and then someone said ‘hydroxychloroquine’ three times,” he added. “It feels like we’re back to Scary Misinformation Trump. I prefer ‘Person, Man, Woman, Camera, TV’ Trump instead,” he said in reference to Trump boasting of a cognitive function test last week on Fox News. “I also liked Point to an Elephant Trump. He was fun.” Despite the Food and Drug Administration’s disavowal of hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus cure, “Trump won’t give up,” Fallon concluded. “He’s like your friend who never stops trying to make you watch the show they’re watching.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers checked in with the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back environmental regulations amid the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic. Given Trump’s bungling of the coronavirus crisis, “you could be forgiven for thinking he hasn’t been doing anything at all”, said Meyers. “However, he has been very successful at rolling back environmental regulations and weakening major conservation laws, all while Americans have been distracted by a global pandemic, because instead of pulling back on pollution when lungs are having their worst year since Mad Men went off the air, Trump has actually been doubling down on his dangerous agenda.” During the coronavirus lockdown in the US, the Trump administration has eased fuel-efficiency standards for new cars, frozen rules for soot air pollution, and leased public property to oil and gas companies. “It’s when Trump seems to be doing nothing that he’s at his most dangerous,” said Meyers. “It’s like when your kids are upstairs and they’re super quiet for way too long – you know you’re about to wallpaper over some sharpie.” The administration has continued to push anti-science policies despite the distraction of coronavirus, Meyers explained, which disproportionately affects people of color, and derive from Trump’s longstanding denial of climate change. “Trump’s view that global warming is a hoax is one of the only stances he’s been consistent on,” Meyers said. “That, and there’s no such thing as a tie that’s too long.” One of the administration’s “biggest and most audacious deregulatory actions” has been to gut the National Environmental Policy Act, a 50-year-old piece of legislation which requires federal agencies consider the environmental impact of infrastructure projects before they are approved, and allows residents to weigh in. Which demands our attention, Meyers concluded, especially in an election year: “The Trump presidency will be over some day, but the sad reality is that the environmental effects will be permanent, and that becomes everyone’s problem.”",culture
"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all John Cleese recently went on a tirade against critics, lambasting them as “ignorant”, “envious” and “untalented”. If you’re an arts critic, you’ve likely been the recipient of this age-old insult before. Read the comments section – that confidence-knocking hellscape we pretend to ignore but prong like a tongue on a wobbly tooth – and you may be greeted with worse. However, is there any truth in it? Are we a bunch of bitter, resentment-filled failures taking revenge on those we secretly envy? It might be difficult to grasp that writing a magazine cover could appeal more than featuring on it, but for many it truly does. Sure, there might be adolescent periods when critics found themselves mimicking Leonard Cohen in their bedroom or painting wannabe Georgia O’Keeffes in the garage. Yet for many, the surge of adrenaline comes from time spent with art, not creating it. Plus, if you’ve ever joined bands on tour, you’ll know it’s mainly schlepping heavy gear around and asking people for wifi codes. However, if you’re besotted by an art form to the point you feel compelled to write about it for – let’s be honest – a meagre living, then it’s no earth-shattering revelation that some may share the same passion for creating that artists do. Mark Cousins, for example, happily coexists as a film director and critic. The prominent art critic Jerry Saltz went to art school and dropped out – making him the archetypal failed artist as critic – yet his Pulitzer prize for criticism was likely not awarded due to his seething hatred and festering animosity towards those who’d made it. It was because of his commitment, knowledge, expertise and desire to further elevate art through written exploration and insight. Martin Scorsese sees the art in arts criticism to such a degree he has repeatedly hired critics to write his screenplays. It is a common misconception that arts criticism is about tearing things apart. The work often errs on the positive side – pick up any magazine and you’ll find an abundance of four-star reviews – but part of the process of panning for gold is encountering disappointment. Ultimately that’s what this job is: a search for beautiful art and to better understand it. The aim is never to go in wanting to dislike: you approach with hope, not hate. That said, the skills required to write about beautiful art are the same required to unpick failures, which explains the satisfying allure of a brutal review.  It’s also not entirely one-way. The Pretenders’ Chrissie Hynde was working for NME – writing what she called “half-baked philosophical drivel and nonsensical tirades” – before she gave it up to form a band. Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys swapped writing about pop stars to become one. Even Marilyn Manson started off writing about music, although perhaps when he underwent his makeup and leather-clad transformation the title Failed Music Journalist didn’t quite have the same ring to it as “God of Fuck”. So, are critics failed artists? Well, if you believe, as many of us do, that criticism is an art form in itself, then obviously it’s a no. If you believe otherwise, I’m sure we’ll be hearing from you in the comments section soon. ",culture
"Louis Theroux’s first series for television, in 1998, was a series of documentaries called Weird Weekends. The central conceit was that Theroux, an innocent abroad, would spend time in a community that was considered fringe, and tell us their stories. Since the series first aired, there is now enough Louis Theroux available on streaming services that it is possible to spend a weird weekend entirely with him. So that is what I did. I sat inside and watched nothing but Louis Theroux films for a whole, weird weekend. I didn’t move through his oeuvre sequentially. Stan has more than 35 Louis Theroux documentaries haphazardly displayed – the titles like a set of playing cards that have been shuffled and thrown down at random. I started only a few years back, with Talking to Anorexia (2017) and Drinking to Oblivion (2016) and then went back to 1998 for Weird Weekends, before fast-forwarding to 2007 for a show on plastic surgery, and so forth. Theroux’s work is easy to dip in and out of. But there is something about taking in the creative products of a long career in one concentrated sweep that allows you to see an edifice emerging, the overall aim of one man’s life’s work: illuminating and humanising the misunderstood. I began my weird weekend with Louis by watching his 2017 special on anorexia. The documentary received criticism for focusing on the very extreme example of eating disorders (in Australia anorexia and bulimia occur in less than 1% of the general population, while other kinds of eating disorders, such as binge eating disorders, affect a much greater number). But focusing on the most harrowing aspects of eating disorders does make for gripping television. Theroux spends time in two of London’s largest eating disorder clinics, meeting patients and grappling with the thorniness of the disease. Why do so many patients not want to get better? What is the best way to treat them? How do you stop people from dying? Attending weigh-ins, eating with them in the clinic, visiting their homes and their parents, sitting in on appointments with doctors – Theroux is pretty gentle here. He’s part therapist, part friend. His questions are searching rather than pointed, but mostly he listens, and the women open up to him. Next up is Savile. This is Theroux’s mea culpa. In the years since Theroux filmed a documentary with him in 2000, Jimmy Savile was revealed to be a sex offender on a grand scale. But for Australian audiences, a lot of the backstory is missing. How did this bizarre and incredibly grim looking man in a string vest end up becoming a beloved children’s entertainer? How on earth could Theroux – evidently so intuitive and intelligent – miss all the signs? Theroux goes back and interviews some of Savile’s victims and interrogates his own work. “What did I miss? What did I get wrong? I really had to look at my own conscience,” says Theroux. One of the victims turns the tables on him. “Do you feel like you were groomed?” No, because he wasn’t abused, Theroux says. “Mentally groomed,” she says. “He mugged you off.” Then I go all the way back to Weird Weekends. Filmed when Theroux was in his 20s, all gangly limbs and John Lennon specs and oversized shirts, he appears to be more easily swept along by the enthusiasms of his subjects; more agreeable and less likely to be confrontational. There are five episodes, all from series one, on Stan. I start with an episode on Christianity. Theroux is in Texas, where he visits an assortment of Christians: some televangelists who hope he’ll decide to become Born Again, a man who hopes to convert people by driving around the state with Christian bumper stickers, and a group called The Family who walk around a nightclub district singing Christian hymns in the hope of converting passersby. Theroux doesn’t ask too many hard questions in this early series. His shtick is to fit in and make people comfortable, so they’ll relax and maybe reveal something of themselves. He’s charming and young, but the early shows lack the ambition to go beyond the first layer of skin. By 2016, there is less drift (and also less joy) but far greater empathy and much deeper engagement with his subjects. He’s less about trying to fit in, and more about illuminating subcultures from different angles. It’s evident, as my weird weekend with Louis progresses back and forth through time, how good he is at interviewing people. He’s not even really interviewing them – he’s having a conversation, trying to create a connection. This empathetic connection to his subjects is Theroux’s greatest contribution to the documentary genre. He’s made films about sex work and pornography, addiction, religion and far-right political extremism. His subjects have traditionally been in peril, marginalised, misunderstood or just plain odd. He is our bridge from their world to ours. His empathy is not merely a passive flow of connection and goodwill towards subjects but involves the work of listening, challenging them, spending time with them and properly seeing them in all their humanity, flaws and complexity. Friday turns into Saturday, which turns into Sunday. I watch Louis watch people shoot up. I watch Louis have liposuction in LA. I watch Louis watching people make porn. I watch Louis hang out with paedophiles and Nazis and the most hated family in America. I learn something new and fascinating about human nature in each episode. After 10 hours of documentaries, I wonder if the universities should just shut down the journalism schools and make people just watch Louis Theroux’s shows. It’s all there. How to gain trust with a closed group. How to interrogate someone’s position without totally alienating them. How to give someone the space to tell their own story. When to go hard with questions, when to pull back, how to learn from your mistakes when you miss the story, and how, without empathy, the stories will die through lack of heart.",culture
"“We’ve gotta find every bit of strength that we have and never let it go,” urges the theme song of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, as it draws you into its warm embrace. It feels relatable in these times. Sure, the reason I need “every bit of strength” is to figure out how to work from home while parenting a small child rather than to save the universe from unspeakable evil, but it’s comparable. It’s one of many ways that She-Ra is perfect lockdown viewing. A reimagining of the 1980s spin-off of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, the reboot delivers colourful escapism that’s gripping and plot-driven while also leaving you with the sense that you’d dive right in and fight alongside the rebellion if given the chance. I originally tuned in when it began in 2018 because it looked like something my then four-year-old daughter might be interested in. By the time I discovered it was a few more steps towards terrifying than Bluey or Doc McStuffins, it had become essential family viewing. The show centres around teenage soldier Adora, who was adopted into the Horde as a baby and has spent her life in the Fright Zone training to fight to wrest control of Etheria from the evil princesses that rule the planet. Just as she is preparing to embark on her first real mission, she stumbles across a mysterious sword and meets Glimmer and Bow, enemies of the Horde. In a moment reminiscent of Mitchell and Webb’s “Are We the Baddies?” sketch, Adora suddenly realises she has been fighting on the side of evil and the people she considers family are terrorising Etheria. Her connection to the sword becomes clear as she realises she can transform into She-Ra, a mythical princess with superhuman powers. For all of its excitement and action, what I like best is the way it blurs the line between good and evil in a way that’s incredibly nuanced for what is ostensibly a children’s show. From Adora’s childhood best friend Catra, to the hug-loving butch Scorpia and even second-in-command Shadow Weaver who at first appears to be the epitome of an irredeemable villain, the members of the Horde are humanised and have as much depth to their characters as those in the rebellion. This depiction of the characters as complex people with varying amounts of light and shade makes the relationships, illustrated against a background of a war zone, come to life. While elemental princess Mermista and the flamboyant sea captain Seahawk provide much of the comic relief with their unlikely romance, it’s the way She-Ra openly centres queer love and romance that’s really powerful. From married princesses Netossa and Spinnerella, to Rebellion archer Bow’s two dads, showrunner Noelle Stevenson put her cards on the table early in the series and continued to develop queer relationships that become more and more central to the plot as the series progresses.  It’s something that is quite joyful to watch with a small child. After years of seeing Disney princesses marry copy-and-paste princes, being able to see my daughter connecting with all these diverse relationships has been wonderful. At the heart of the show is the relationship between Adora and Catra – fighting on opposite sides, they are at war for much of the show but through a series of flashbacks we see the depth of their connection as children and understand what they mean to each other. It’s a complicated relationship that’s tied up in friendship, hate, jealousy, power and love.  While the backdrop might not be of this world, the characters are as familiar as old friends, and finding every bit of strength that you have and never letting go is something we can all relate to, whether we’re fighting for our lives or just hoping to one day go back outside.",culture
"Meta comedy, in which celebrities play fictionalised or “exaggerated” versions of themselves, is a mixed bag. The two-season Hollywood Darlings (featuring, among others, Full House’s Jodie Sweetin) never really took off, and despite the hype and nostalgia surrounding the Beverly Hills 90210 reboot, it too failed to pack a punch – even with nods to Shannon Doherty’s “drama queen” reputation. The same cannot be said for the show Episodes, in which Matt LeBlanc portrays himself as an actor subsisting off the fumes of his phenomenal Friends success. A satirical skewering of the Hollywood machine, Friends writers (and real-life couple) David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik brilliantly and gleefully pull back the curtains on television, with LeBlanc playing a heightened version of himself – but one that clearly riffs off public expectation. And while LeBlanc is the star, the show’s focus extends to the supporting players in a Hollywood’s star’s universe. Indeed, the pilot of Episodes quickly tells you what kind of show this is going to be: having just won a Bafta for their prestigious comedy Lyman’s Boys, the story of a boys’ school headmaster in love with a lesbian librarian, an English couple and writing duo, Sean and Beverly Lincoln (Stephen Mangan and Tamsin Greig), are approached by a puffed-up US network head, Merc Lapidus (John Pankow). He breathlessly heaps praise on them – “I love your show. I love it. Seriously ... I want to have sex with your show” – then convinces them to pack their bags and move to LA to show-run a US version of the award-winning series. But upon arrival, housed in an extravagant mansion once used as a set for a reality TV show, the Lincolns soon get the lay of the land: the network executive lackeys propping up Lapidus, similarly ebullient and flattering, admit that, well, Lapidus hasn’t actually watched Lyman’s Boys. This paves the way for the Americans to decimate what was a pathos-packed dramedy, replacing an esteemed old English actor with LeBlanc as a downtrodden high school hockey coach who has the hots for the librarian (no longer a lesbian). Oh, and now the show is called Pucks!. For meta comedy like this to work, you have to play with the truth but you can’t dispense with it completely. And in Episodes, LeBlanc is only too happy to appear imperfect, a little burnt from his time in the sun, wizened from years stumbling along the Hollywood hamster wheel. But rather than dissolve into pure parody, LeBlanc, who is most famous for his Joey Tribbiani pick-up line “How you doin’?”, neatly subverts the perception that he is Joey. His waters can run deep but, more importantly, he knows how to sell himself, and he’s not done being successful and famous. It’s understandable that celebrities playing themselves guard the privacy of their non-famous friends and family. But the genius of Episodes is its reliance on essential truths. LeBlanc’s personal life is a story thread but really what shines through is the show’s exploration of fame, and the ways in which Hollywood massacres pure intention, chewing and spitting out its talents, and creating entertainment by committee. It’s an astute cautionary tale: you can reach peak success but one day find yourself at the bottom again, wealthy but dissatisfied because you’ve tasted relevance. Meanwhile, part of the show’s strength is its supporting cast. There are the besieged Lincolns, whose dreams of a breakthrough are rapidly becoming a nightmare. As long-suffering second to Lapidus, Carol (Kathleen Rose Perkins) is the guide for both the Lincolns and the viewer. She eases us in, delicately, before slamming us with the truth: nothing in Hollywood is real – even the tall columns in the reality TV mansion. LeBlanc’s Pucks! co-star, Morning Randolph (Mircea Monroe), keeps her breasts fake and perky, and her age is Hollywood’s worst-kept secret. And honourable mention goes to Myra (Daisy Haggard), the network’s head of comedy, despite having no sense of humour or even the ability to crack a genuine smile. In place of thoughtful assessment, she contorts her face in wild confusion, perhaps wondering, like us, why anyone would willingly work in television. A scene in which she tries to give the Lincolns “some notes” after a table read is genius, showing us you can be good at your job but it means nothing if no one else is. Episodes draws generously from the creators’ insider knowledge. They know Hollywood’s fickleness and folly. With its very human, faulty characters, it joyfully holds these foibles up to the light. But it’s smart enough to know that any good story requires more, and with five seasons, there is plenty of opportunity to grow these characters into more than hopeless Hollywood off-cuts. ",culture
"One of the most famous objects in the world, the Rosetta Stone, is to have its little-known gay history explored on public tours for the first time by the British Museum. The stone is known for its crucial role in giving the scholars Jean-François Champollion and Thomas Young the key to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. It has been in the museum collection since 1802 and is regularly named as the number one object people want to see. But the museum argues another character deserves his place in the story too: William John Bankes, a charming, adventurous and rich Egyptologist who was forced to flee Britain after he was caught having sex in Green Park with a soldier. Because of Bankes, the Rosetta Stone is being added to LGBTQ+ themed tours of the British Museum which began last year and have become hugely popular, said Stuart Frost, the museum’s head of interpretation and volunteers. “The first run of tours was booked out within an hour or two, demand was really high, volunteers enjoy doing them and we’ve had great feedback from the public,” he said. Frost sees them as a good vehicle for sharing new research with the public. “Sometimes it is new stories, sometimes it is highlighting stories which are just not very well known because historically they have been overlooked.” For that reason about 20 objects are being added to the tours, including the Rosetta Stone. The tours have stemmed from a gay history book written by Richard Parkinson, a former British Museum curator who was in charge of the stone for many years. He argues that “every object is potentially queer” and that it just takes some scratching of the surface to find connections. Frost said most people would not know “that a gay man was instrumental in making the Rosetta Stone one of the most famous historical objects in the world”. The actual text on the Rosetta Stone is strikingly dry: priests asking for a tax break. But its importance is immeasurable because it says the same thing in three different scripts, which allowed the early scholars to crack the code of hieroglyphics. Champollion and Young are rightly famous because of it. But the museum says it was Bankes who discussed the possibility that the texts on the stone might all say the same thing, and he correctly supposed that a recurring cartouche represented a royal name. An obelisk collected by Bankes and which stands in the grounds of Kingston Lacy, his lavish Dorset home, was used in deciphering the stone. Bankes remains a fascinating character. Described by his friend Lord Byron as the “father of all mischief”, he was forced to flee Britain in 1841 when, in his mid-50s, he was charged with “unnatural offences”. Because it was the second time he had been caught, execution was a real possibility. Other new objects on the tours will include an ancient Greek coin depicting the poet Sappho and a Roman lamp showing two women having oral sex, probably representing a male fantasy. There is also a 1777 medal of the Chevalier d’Eon, an 18th-century soldier, diplomat and spy who lived alternately as a man and a woman in France and England. The most recent is a “Bank of Duckie” nine-bob note, a fake banknote made for a 2008 club event called Gay Shame Goes Macho, featuring the gangster Ronnie Kray instead of the Queen. They join busts of the Roman emperor Hadrian and his lover Antinous, a gender-fluid depiction of a Babylonian deity dating from 1800BC, and arguably the museum’s most famous gay object, the Warren Cup, a Roman drinking vessel showing two scenes of men making love. The museum is planning for reopening after the government gave the all clear for museums and galleries to open their doors from 4 July. A formal date has yet to be announced but the LGBT+ tours will be among the first tours to restart, said Frost. In the meantime the possibility of having them online is being explored.",culture
"In May, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age announced the recipients of a $150,000 arts criticism funding initiative from the Copyright Agency and the Judith Neilson Institute: five white-Australian culture critics. As a creative producer at Sweatshop Western Sydney Literacy Movement, where we coordinate the writing component of StoryCasters – a Diversity Arts Australia initiative that supports CaLD arts reviewers, which I had introduced the Herald’s arts editor to – I and many First Nations writers and writers of colour were deeply disappointed. We have been part of developing conversations around the monolithic white industry of arts criticism in Australia, and have watched again and again as nothing has changed. We were stunned that news outlets traditionally perceived to be progressive would not take this funding as an opportunity to diversify the pool. On Monday afternoon, Jack Callil and Bec Kavanagh, two book critics selected by the Herald and the Age, tweeted a joint resignation letter, expressing solidarity with non-white writers and acknowledging that the Nine papers had “missed an opportunity”. As Benjamin Law tweeted, this was a “genuinely sad outcome”. Most of us who took issue with the appointments were not attacking the white Australians who were selected: we are most interested in seeing the structural changes that will prevent it from happening again. It’s not as though the talent doesn’t exist. There are a multitude of Australian literary outlets run by and publishing critics of colour, including Sweatshop, Peril Magazine, Liminal, Mascara Literary Review and Djed Press. These publications and writers may not be on the radar of predominantly white outlets – but in a country where half the population comes from either a first- or second-generation migrant background, that’s what needs to change. For any institution with an overrepresentation of white staff, diversity quotas have been proven to work. Writer and lawyer Dr Randa Abdel-Fatteh advocates the importance of an intersectional and race-oriented approach to quotas in business and academia and her arguments are certainly applicable to the arts industry, where monocultural leadership seems to ensure monocultural hiring decisions. To repurpose Abdel-Fatteh’s argument, advocating for diversity quotas in the arts is “not about introducing a policy of affirmative action; it’s about shifting an already existing policy of affirmative action” from white communities to BIPOC communities. On Wednesday, the Nine papers confirmed the reopening of Callil and Kavanagh’s former positions, with the assurance that “the roles are posted more widely to encourage a greater diversity of applicants”. In essence, the response shifts the blame from the structural issues at the heart of the decision to the visibility of their call-out. This is the crux of the problem. Across all sectors of the arts, we are at a turning point in the conversation about diversity and race. Apologies and empty pledges are no longer enough. In the visual arts, Soo-Min Shim and Eugene Yiu Nam Cheung critique the whiteness of the Archibald prize and its absence of non-white winners, identifying the roots of the problem in the structures that govern and judge it. Cheung’s observation has stayed with me: “At the heart of the art world lies a machine that serves to only better the material conditions of white people.” The precision of this quote stings at the same time that it liberates. Seeing a gut feeling articulated so boldly is to feel heard as a person of colour in this industry. For too long, First Nations and artists of colour have felt gaslit whenever we speak up about racism and the structural barriers we face. In the literary sphere, Sujatha Fernandes analyses the positive coverage Jeanine Cummins’ American Dirt received from white Australian journalists at the Good Weekend and the Sydney Morning Herald. Fernandes argues that both journalists failed to adequately engage with the critical conversation around the novel’s depictions of race in America, or with their inherent biases as white Australians. Fernandes draws parallels between American Dirt and Australian author Anna Krien’s 2019 novel Act of Grace, in which Krien writes from the perspective of First Nations characters and people of colour. It says something of the Australian literary reviewership that Act of Grace has not faced a fraction of the nuanced discussion that American Dirt received. In the performing arts, Moreblessing Maturure shared a clip of comedian Josh Thomas talking about how difficult it is to find an actor of colour who is experienced enough to cast. Writer Brodie Lancaster called out the double standards on Twitter: Thomas had no acting credits before casting himself as the lead in Please Like Me, and neither did his best friend Thomas Ward, who co-starred in the show. Thomas has apologised for his comments and said he is committed to do better – but what this incident should reveal to all gatekeepers is that their selection criteria, purportedly based on “merit”, are more likely based on biases which, without meaningful structural change, will continue to shut out and shut down marginalised voices. The lesson continues in the film industry. Last weekend, playwright Michelle Law exposed the Sydney Film festival’s decision to award a “profoundly problematic” film, Mukbang, which she said contained racist scenes. In a series of tweets, Law explained how the film appropriates Korean culture to serve the story of a white person, and featured an illustration of a Black boy being choked by a white woman – which was silently cut after complaints. The Sydney film festival is yet to release a public statement, although Scanlen and the production team have apologised. “If more BIPOC creators and creatives were involved in all stages of production, this would not have occurred,” Scanlen said on Instagram. But as Law pointed out, there was another structural issue behind this film being deemed a winner: an all-white panel of judges. White Australian artists may individually apologise and pledge to do better, but nothing is changing at the top. The recent decision to axe ABC Life, a platform which championed diverse stories and viewpoints but was at the heart of a culture war waged largely by white gatekeepers, is the most recent example. Again and again, racially marginalised artists carry the burden of exposing the problems entrenched within this industry, while the institutions themselves remain silent. Change at a structural level is needed to prevent racism from occurring in the first place. Shirley Le is a creative producer at Sweatshop Literacy Movement.

"It is a point in favor of TV’s sprawling proliferation that one gets, in the course of a year, both a lush, serious historical drama starring Helen Mirren as Catherine the Great on HBO, and its tonal opposite, Hulu’s raucous, gleefully brutal The Great, which puts an asterisk right on the title card: “An Occasionally True Story.” The Great, developed by Tony McNamara, the writer of absurd court send-up The Favourite, cares little for the historical accuracy of the 18th-century Russian monarch. Its Catherine (Elle Fanning) arrives in the backward, hedonistic Russian court as a naive 19-year-old bride in 1761. The real Catherine was 35 and a mother by then, but that’s fine – free from the constraints of biography or pedantic seriousness, The Great’s occasional truth delivers, ironically, a more lasting impression of a real, flesh and blood princess – one slowly but determinedly amassing power, enlightened but ambitious to rule. It’s a counterintuitive and refreshing insight the show shares not only with its clear predecessors – The Favourite and Sofia Coppola’s 2006 film Marie Antoinette – but with other recent historical-ish content such as Apple TV’s Dickinson, or the new film Shirley. In these absurd, anachronistic or downright fictional depictions of oft-biographied historical figures – women frequently defined against the restrictions of their period – it turns out that the farther one strays from the record, the more clear and accessible the window into their character. Take, for example, one of the most effective highlights of The Great: 19-year-old Catherine, cinched in a corset and petticoat, silk shoes squelching in mud, arrives on a battlefield intending to cheer the soldiers with a flushed smile and a box of pastel macaroons. But the bloodied man she meets has lost his fingers and can’t grasp the cookie. “I’ll just pop it in your mouth,” Catherine attempts, baffled and floundering. “It’s pistachio, if that’s helpful.” The scene is comically rich for its obscene clash of opulence and suffering – the ludicrous macaroon box, the farce that is Catherine’s sincere scheme to appear helpful. Never mind that the real Catherine was a palace veteran by then, or that cream macaroons were invented in the 1930s. The historical record is absolutely beside the point; the show’s razor-sharp reveal is in Catherine’s laughable naivety, in the archly callous disregard of life, the clash of aloof power with Enlightenment ideals. The real Catherine was, indeed, absorbed by Enlightenment thinkers and a voracious reader who nonetheless consolidated power, a point conveyed with a highly anachronistic “FUCK!!!!” as she tosses the silly macaroons out of her carriage window on the ride home. “Russia cannot continue on this path!” she exclaims, a one-stop line of self-serving earnestness. The Great, like The Favourite, relishes the timeless comedy of bodily messes (the macaroon episode is called “Blood and Vomit”). A splotchy rash which blooms across Catherine’s chest becomes its own punchline; Fanning’s flushes as she errs or storms off feel like characters of their own. The performance draws viewers in; it’s easy to recall your own storms of emotion in watching Catherine traverse disappointment and ambition – even if her naivety is a fiction within an absurd court farce. There’s a similar drive for relatability underscoring Dickinson, Apple TV’s riff on the life of American poet Emily Dickinson, which fills a loose sketch of her biography with half-ironic #feminism one-liners, swearing and a death fantasy starring rapper Wiz Khalifa. The series, developed by Alena Smith, takes some inspiration from the show Drunk History, in which the past becomes sweetly, hilariously companionable through boozy retellings dubbed over celebrity actors. The real Emily Dickinson was an introvert who rarely published in her lifetime; privately, her poetry experimented with form, the better to capture waves in the storm of one’s mind. TV Dickinson manifests that creative radicalism externally, dispensing with the poet’s longstanding public persona – shy, reclusive – in favor of candid, barbed ambition. As played by the excellent Hailee Steinfeld, to varying effect (I didn’t initially love the show, which felt half-baked in parts, but have warmed to it in later episodes), this Dickinson maintains an affair with her brother’s fiancee, calls bullshit on doing chores and manipulates a crush into publishing her poetry. Confronted with a no-girls-allowed rule for science demonstrations at the local college, Emily translates the era’s subtext plainly: “Maybe they’re so scared that if they teach us how the world works we’ll figure out a way how to take over.” It’s a weirdly entertaining send-up of the real societal limitations facing Dickinson, giving real talent and ambition, however unarticulated or thwarted or quiet, room to breathe and flaunt.  Dispensing with the facts entirely can be more evocative of said talent, as demonstrated by Shirley, released on-demand this week in the US (its theatrical run scrapped by Covid), a film which rejects the biopic entirely for a fiction mirroring the work of its protagonist, the mid-century horror writer Shirley Jackson. The film, directed by Josephine Decker and based on the novel by Susan Scarf Merrell, takes real-life inspirations for Jackson’s work – her agoraphobia, her emotionally abusive but co-dependent marriage, her imposing house in Vermont – as material for a psychodrama in which a younger couple staying as guests, and the women’s hold on reality, combusts under the Jackson roof. The film aims not for accuracy but instead to drop the viewer into a Jackson story, which does far more to dig into the truth of her genius, and to honor her work excavating the ghoulish, terrifying depths of women’s insecurities and mental prisons, than any by-the-numbers portrait ever could. Though in an entirely different register than the two comic series, Shirley presents perhaps the best example of liberated fiction’s potential as the most effective female biopic. A life’s recounting bound to “fact” would necessarily focus on constraint, struggle or the negotiation of image and ambition in a man’s world. Instead, Shirley centers the author’s artistic brilliance, Dickinson revels in the poet’s real creative confidence, The Great trickily extricates the contradictions of the Enlightened despot’s position. It’s not fact, per se, but who’s to say that’s not closer to the truth?",culture
"There have been times in the past week when the news has been so appalling – and when fury and despair have threatened to take over so completely – that I’ve gone scrambling in search of musical solace. Some of what I’ve enjoyed most has been at the distinctly homemade end of the spectrum: LPO double bassist Hugh Kluger’s breathtakingly luminous performance of the Prelude from JS Bach’s Cello Suite No 2, for instance, filmed at home in Australia (available via LPOnline). Or the 15th instalment of the Kanneh-Mason family livestream (via Facebook), in which the wobbly camera, cellist Sheku’s self-conscious introductions and the occasional maternal voice off-camera add to the charm of watching performances from the UK’s most famous musical family. In this episode it’s Rachmaninov’s song The Muse, arranged for cello and piano by Sheku and his pianist sister, Isata, that sticks in the mind: the cello as rich and lyrical as you could wish for, their musical partnership endlessly communicative. Of course, there are innumerable more polished opportunities for musical escapism. I relished Angela Hewitt’s Kings Place performance of Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 22 K482 with Aurora Orchestra conducted by Duncan Ward from December 2019 (available until 17 June) in this vein. The outer movements are stylish, if polite, the orchestra always light on its feet, Hewitt’s phrasing always graceful. The slow middle movement, though, is almost painfully beautiful: momentum gathers from a tentative opening to blossom slowly into warmth as Hewitt enters. This is music-making with an enviable, precious sense of unrestricted space. Best of all is Hewitt’s brief encore – the Gigue from JS Bach’s Partita No 1 – which is mesmerising and limpid: a reminder of her extraordinary command of Bach’s keyboard music. Music’s distractions have rarely felt more necessary. But the stakes remain high – the politics of any musical performance inescapable – no matter how transcendent the sounds. Like so many, I was deeply moved by Stephen Hough’s recital inaugurating the season of special live broadcasts from Wigmore Hall and Radio 3. His Bach-Busoni Chaconne managed to be both monumental and intimate, his Schumann Fantasie impeccably poised, Hough in total control for its duration over time’s onward march. Yet I couldn’t forget hearing Wigmore Hall CEO John Gilhooly on Radio 4’s Front Row only days earlier, describing the new series as “a glimmer of hope” – but insisting that, while the Wigmore might be able to survive financially into next year, “others will go under in the next six to eight weeks”. The danger, then, is that music – and the other performing arts – can be dismissed by those holding the public purse strings as nothing more than a “delightful reprieve”, dispensable at a time of global crisis. Opera North’s 2017 production of Bernstein’s Trouble in Tahiti offers one obvious retort to that view: it’s a claustrophobic opera at the best of times (an unflinching portrait of a marriage on the rocks) and a seriously tough watch under lockdown. A performance this slick, this unbearably true-to-life, offers no escapist pleasure – rather it’s a bracing challenge to face the music.  Flora’s pick for the coming week I still remember the emotional hangover left by Samuel Barber’s Vanessa in Keith Warner’s ultra-stark production at Glyndebourne in 2018 and can’t resist watching it again on operavision.eu (from 14 June). And I’ll also be watching Richard Jones’s staging of Puccini’s Il trittico at Royal Opera House (until 19 June), above all for Ermonela Jaho’s extraordinary debut as Suor Angelica.",culture
"Dame Jocelyn Barrow served on the advisory committee for what was to become the Transatlantic Slavery Gallery: Against Human Dignity at the Merseyside Maritime Museum (MMM) in Liverpool. The project was a longheld ambition of Sir Peter Moores and, having served on the board of governors of the BBC with Jocelyn, he was keen for her to help and advise.  The original research for what had been considered a taboo subject was commissioned by the Peter Moores Foundation and had been kept a well-guarded secret. No location could be found to host what was expected to be such an incendiary project until National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside agreed to make space for the display. It was particularly appropriate for the gallery to be in Liverpool, which not only has one of the oldest black communities in Europe but was also a major slaving port in the 18th century. With Jocelyn very much hands-on, it all came together, and the gallery, opened in 1994 by Maya Angelou, proved a great success. It was later moved to a new area in the MMM, enlarged and with a broader brief, and renamed the International Slavery Museum.",culture
"In his latest Closer Look segment, Seth Meyers addressed sustained protests against anti-black racism and the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last week, and Donald Trump’s authoritarian responses in Washington, which have become so egregious that even his former defense secretary Jim Mattis publicly denounced him. Despite saying upon his resignation last year that he would “not speak ill of a sitting president”, Mattis warned Americans in an article in the Atlantic this week that they “must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution”. In response, the president tweeted: “Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General…His nickname was ‘Chaos,’ which I didn’t like & changed to ‘Mad Dog’.” “OK, first of all, he resigned. You didn’t fire him,” Meyers corrected. “Second, you didn’t come up with the name Mad Dog. He’s had it since at least 2004, and we know you didn’t come up with it because it’s a cool nickname and your nicknames suck … if you had come up with a nickname for him it would’ve been something like Lame James or Jumpin’ Jim.” It’s clear, Meyers continued, that “Trump and the police establishment are obviously threatened by the widespread popularity of the protests, which have been both effective and everywhere.” Protesters have spoken up in all 50 states. “The map is finally all red, but not for the reason that Trump wants,” said Meyers. “This kind of massive, sustained political mobilization represents a direct threat to the unjust system of predatory policing we currently have, which is why the people who benefit from this system are lashing out so aggressively,” Meyers continued. “One after another, we’ve watched countless videos of local police departments arresting or violently attacking peaceful protesters, and reporters lawfully exercising their first amendment rights.” For example, cellphone video captured a Miami police officer shoving a woman with her hands up to the ground; the Miami Herald later found that that officer had been reviewed by police internal affairs for excessive force 79 times in three and a half years on the job. “Seventy-nine times in three and a half years – I haven’t used shampoo that much in the same time period,” said Meyers. “And granted, I probably should’ve, but how many times do you have to get in trouble before you get fired. No other job works like that! If a commercial airline pilot had been investigated 79 times for flying upside down and doing barrel rolls while hammered on Goldschläger, we wouldn’t be like, ‘All right, man, 80 strikes and you’re out!’” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert marveled at the spread of the protests across America, noting that at least 430 cities and towns – from New York to Atlanta to Laramie, Wyoming, and Helena, Montana – have seen demonstrations in support of Black Lives Matter. “These protests are uniting Americans of all backgrounds, because you may have noticed that Boise, Idaho, does not have a lot of black people. Neither does Laramie, Wyoming,” he said.  “Please don’t buy the false narrative that these are lawless mobs,” Colbert added. “The vast majority of these protests have been peaceful. And you might not know that if you watch cable news, because to the news, peace is boring. That’s why CNN just launched their sister network: the Burning Trash Can Channel.” Meanwhile, tensions have been escalated by police enforcing curfews in cities across the nation, from New York to Los Angeles. “The point of a curfew is to stop lawbreakers from taking advantage of protests, but in some cities, protesters are getting swept up by cops in curfews starting as early as 6pm,” Colbert explained, as police use curfew “as an excuse to bring the smackdown on peaceful protesters”. Colbert also touched on Mattis’s public denunciation of Trump, which he called “especially surprising” because Mattis’s parting words were: “I will not speak ill of a sitting president.”  “Evidently, he will speak ill of a president sitting on a bed covered in cold curly fries,” said Colbert. “Protests are continuing nationwide,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, and in Washington, “where law enforcement has taken a much more forceful approach, including teargassing peaceful protesters, things are not as amicable. “Authorities there are busy erecting another fence that will go around the existing White House fence, which will make two fences.“ Kimmel continued. “So it looks like Trump is finally getting his wall built after all. How long before we find out Don Jr invested in a fence company?” Meanwhile, Kimmel dissected Trump’s tweet-response to Mattis’s “one-star Yelp review” which called Trump a threat to the constitution. Trump’s claim that he nicknamed Mattis Mad Dog is an outright lie, given that he has been called that for many years prior to his work in the administration. “What a strange thing to lie about – it’s so easily disproved!”  Finally, a Twitter user experimented with posting Trump’s tweets, verbatim, to see if they would be blocked for inciting violence. They were indeed blocked by the platform, while Trump’s exact same tweets went unmarked. Which made Kimmel wonder if “maybe Twitter has a way of determining who is and isn’t a threat based on how tiny the person who tweeted’s thumbs are”.",culture
"The country is on fire. The islands are beneath the ocean. The government has stopped the boats. There is a global virus that selects its victims across racial lines. The authorities are kidnapping refugees in the summer night. The police are assaulting a door-to-door salesman because his skin is two shades too dark. Eighteen months ago I was asked to develop an anthology which imagined Australia in the year 2050. Originally conceived by the executive director of Diversity Arts Australia, Lena Nahlous, this book would bring together Indigenous writers and writers of colour from every state and territory in Australia to create a collection of short stories and poems in the increasingly popular literary form called “speculative fiction”. In the aftermath of the Black Summer bushfires and amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the Black Lives Matter protests, who among us could ever have speculated that by the time this publication was complete, it would look more like a picture of our current reality, rather than our inevitable future.  As a starting point for this article, I was presented with a simple question: “What happens when 12 diverse writers are asked to imagine Australia in 2050?” The answer hit me while I was breaking my fast on a halal Big Mac during the holy month of Ramadan. What happens? They do the one thing that creatives of colour do best: they don’t listen.  As the editor, I envisioned a book that would imagine a world after empires, after colonies and after white supremacy. So I called it After Australia. However, the writer of Martu ancestry, Karen Wyld sent me a story which intertwined three historical timelines, disentangling the complexity of contemporary Indigenous identity. Award-winning author of The Permanent Resident, Roanna Gonsalves, wrote a love letter to the printing press, which examined the governor’s order in 1814.  I wondered if I needed to inform these writers that their contributions did not align with the intended vision of the project, which was to imagine Australia’s future. But then, while searching through the bookshelves at Bankstown Library for an apocalyptic statement by some famous author to include in the book as an epigraph, I stumbled upon a quote by the black civil rights leader Malcolm X: All at once it occurred to me that Australia’s future could only be written on the foundations of our past and present. From the groundwork laid out by writers such as Karen and Roanna, the author of No Country Woman, Zoya Patel details a dystopian (not-too-distant-and-kind-of-already-here) future where bushfires have ravaged the ACT and our neighbouring islands have drowned. As the brown people are trying to get in throughout Zoya’s story, in screenwriter Michelle Law’s story, the brown people are trying to get out, while under the occupation of a fascist society that makes 1984 look like The Little Mermaid. Meanwhile, Noongar author of The Old Lie, Claire G Coleman, introduces us to the Ostraka Law of 2039. Her story subverts the notions of systemic institutions and explores both the physical and psychological prisons that manifest in a racialised society. Newcomer Sarah Ross rewrites her experiences as the child of an interracial same-sex couple amid the rubble of the Taj Mahal. Emerging poet Kaya Ortiz plays out our future as a lyrical exercise in multiple choice. Multi-award-winning author and illustrator Ambelin Kwaymullina sends Australia 2020 a dire message from the Ngurra Palya of 2050, and writer and cultural critic, Khalid Warsame depicts an environment that will likely feel the most mundane and safe among all the stories in After Australia, until, you realise it isn’t. Perhaps the most controversial contribution in After Australia is written by the poet and essayist, Omar J. Sakr. In his short story, White Flu, he dissects the vivid texture of multicultural suburbia against a global pandemic that will be frighteningly familiar to readers at this moment in time, only this particular virus seems to have selected “white” people as its primary casualty. On the day that the news about the coronavirus first broke out, approximately three months after Omar had completed White Flu, he sent me a text message:  F***** strewth, fair dunkum, the flu is coming tru! However, as many may gasp at Sakr’s prophecy, the most fascinating aspect of White Flu is not the global pandemic in the background, but the narrative that takes place in the foreground: an Arab-Australian Muslim man from western Sydney is having an affair with his male cousin. Sakr is one of Australia’s few artists who knows how to strike at both ends of the culturally-conservative spectrum: Arabs and Muslims won’t care that the protagonist is sleeping with his cousin, but they’ll be shocked that he is gay, and white people won’t care that the protagonist is gay, but they’ll be disgusted that he’s sleeping with his cousin.  In an equally prophetic story, a playwright and author originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Future Destiny Fidel, lays bare the tragic future and destiny of so many young men whose only crime is that they are born with black skin. Future’s story, Your Skin is the Only Cloth You Cannot Wash, recounts an incident in which he was going from door-to-door selling solar panels to the residents of Mount Ommaney, Brisbane. Suddenly he was confronted and arrested by a group of white police officers after a complaint from a concerned citizen about a strange black man wandering the neighbourhood. Future’s story arrives in a present where protests throughout the United States have erupted after the killing of George Floyd under the knee of a white police officer. This incident was straight off the heels of another “lynching” of an innocent African American male from Georgia, named Ahmaud Arbery, who was violently gunned down by two white vigilantes who claimed he looked like a man suspected in several break-ins in their area.  As Australians attempt to seize this moment and expose our own history of systemic and structural racism, particularly towards Indigenous communities, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had some advice for us: ‘We don’t need to draw equivalence here.” You’re a few hundred years too late, Morrison. We’re not speculating – this shit’s happening.  In a country where Indigenous people are regularly assaulted by police; where young African men are demonised as “gangsters” by our news media and politicians; where Pacific Islanders are overrepresented in our prisons; where Muslims cannot conduct their Friday prayers without wondering if an Australian-born white supremacist is lurking outside with a machine gun; and where we cannot go into self-isolation without blaming four-and-a-half billion Asians – solidarity between Australia’s minorities is central to our survival. By far the most unique aspect of After Australia is the way in which all the stories and poems converge into a unified voice speaking for our past, present and future as a whole. Wiradjuri writer Hannah Donnelly guides us on this journey with her collection of stories, Black Thoughts. In spite of the challenges we face as a nation, Hannah’s words remind us that there is hope as the world continues to unravel: “Our time is a loop. We’ll find our way back, before, after...” After Australia, $24.99, is edited by Michael Mohammed Ahmad and published by Affirm Press in partnership with Diversity Arts Australia and Sweatshop Literacy Movement",culture
"On Wednesday’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert opened with news that Minnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, had elevated charges against police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with killing George Floyd last week by kneeling on his neck for over eight minutes. Ellison elevated Chauvin’s charges to second-degree murder and added charges of aiding and abetting murder to the other three officers on the scene. “So, activism works. Justice is possible – easy, peasy, hold protests for nine days straight in 80 American cities squeezy,” said Colbert. Meanwhile, Trump’s recent conduct recalled for Colbert the night he was elected, when the host was “somewhat emotional” because “what I was worried about deep down is that Trump is a dictator fanboy. He is a lifetime subscriber to ‘Tiger Beat down the protesters’. And now we’re teetering dangerously close to Trump making his dreams our nightmare.” Colbert referred to Trump’s “fascist photo op” on Monday, when he ordered non-violent protesters removed from the area in front of St John’s church in DC with flash grenades and teargas so Trump could take a picture holding a Bible. “It was like a little Tiananmen Square, or in Trump’s case, Tiny Man Square,” said Colbert. Trump reportedly “went medieval on the protesters in part because he was upset – humiliated, really – about the TV people revealing that he hid in a bunker over the weekend”, reports which Trump attempted to dismiss of Fox News radio as “false” because he was there for a “tiny, little, short period of time … for an inspection”. “That is an all-time great excuse,” said Colbert. “So he was just checking to make sure the bunker was OK – ‘I didn’t poop my pants, I just ran diagnostics on my boxers to see if they were load-bearing. They are.” Even worse, Trump’s pap walk to the photo op was accompanied by the secretary of defense, Mark Esper, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milly. “One of the hallmarks of American democracy is the US armed forces’ proud tradition of remaining out of politics to emphasize civilian control of the military, yet on the way to the photo-op – that was, yet again, preceded by attacking peaceful protesters – Esper and Milly walked with Trump across the street,” Colbert explained. “It reminds me of the old joke: why did the defense secretary and the chairman of the joint chiefs cross the road? Because the president is a chicken.” On Wednesday, Esper defended the farcical promenade by telling reporters: “I didn’t know where I was going.” Colbert would have none of it: “You’re the secretary of defense, and your defense is that you didn’t know where you were going? The rest of us could see exactly where you were going.” Colbert also lamented displays of unnecessary force by police across the country, such as those dressed in riot gear on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and large, armored military vehicles driven down the streets of the capital. “Secretary Esper, do you see where we’re going now?” Colbert said of the vehicles. “It’s so close you don’t need a ride – you could walk. Although, really, more of a goosestep.” “The whole world has been watching and weighing in,” said Jimmy Kimmel of the nine days of nationwide protests against anti-black racism and police brutality in America. Even China’s government released a statement saying it hoped America would “take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination”. “And when China is giving you a lecture on human rights – not a great sign,” said Kimmel. Kimmel also lambasted Trump’s Bible photo op from Monday, which White House press secretary and “business suit Barbie” Kayleigh McEnany insisted on Wednesday was not a photo op despite basically telling reporters it was a photo op. “Let’s review the facts here,” said Kimmel. “He walked to the church. He stood in front of the church. He never went in the church. Never spoke to anyone from the church, didn’t examine the damage to the church, held a Bible upside down, didn’t read from the Bible, didn’t give a speech, posed for photos and left.  “I don’t know, that sounds like a pretty textbook definition of a photo op to me. He treated it like taking your kid to see Santa at the mall.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon recapped Trump’s abysmal poll numbers, which put disapproval of his performance at 54%, the highest recorded for any president at this point in his first term. “Right now, Trump seems to be polling somewhere between Jake Paul and that time I decided to grow a mustache for the summer,” Fallon joked. “When Trump saw his numbers, he started crying and then was like, ‘I’m not crying, it’s the teargas from my church photoshoot blowing back in my face.’ “That’s right, everyone seems to be turning on him – to give you an example, Fox & Friends is now just Fox and Friend,” he continued. “At this point, Trump should just go for 100% disapproval and then take credit for uniting the country.” As for the Bible photo op, Fallon had some questions on Trump’s form: “How does Trump not know how to hold a book?” he wondered, playing footage of Trump waving the Bible with his “broken GI Joe hand … it’s like he’s plucking the Bible from the Bible tree.”",culture
"Charlotte Higgins is right to stress real opportunities for the arts when the present crisis recedes (After the war, the arts came back stronger. They can do so again now, 18 May). Large arts venues like the Royal Albert Hall must be saved from collapse; their easily reusable spaces are ideal for small-scale performances of music, theatre, dance, all possible with physical distancing of performers and audience. Informal lunchtime concerts, free rehearsals, experimental work, “rewritten” classics (Sophocles, Shakespeare, Chekhov), Beethoven symphonies scored for chamber forces, “grand opera” with two singers and a piano – the opportunities for breaking down elitist barriers are limitless, with huge benefits to artists and audiences. All it takes is money. A massive government loan, interest-free, would surely be repaid in time by a newly energised arts world, reaching out to new audiences as well as loyal enthusiasts.Judith ChernaikDirector, Poems on the Underground  Charlotte Higgins presents an updated version of the classic case for the arts. But with a Conservative government, let’s not forget the income they generate for the exchequer and for businesses such as hotels and restaurants.Mark WoolgarGuildford, Surrey  Would it not be possible for the Arts Council to launch an appeal directed at theatre- and concert-goers who are currently saving a great deal of money by not going out? To respond with a donation or direct debit would not be altruistic but self-interested, since all arts lovers want to see a thriving culture return. The Octagon or Wigmore Hall are not likely to be high on the government’s priority list.James WatsonLondon  The economic case for emergency government support for the arts is unimpeachable, given ample research that every £1 invested in the arts returns at least four times that to the wider economy. But any support should go first to small regional theatre companies rather than places like the National Theatre (National Theatre may shed 30% of its staff without more support, 21 May). High-profile London-based institutions will always be able to attract significant corporate donations. Much smaller companies will fold soon for the lack of money that would be chickenfeed to the NT.Norman MillerBrighton  As Antonia Fraser points out (Letters, 18 May), during the war cultural organisations did not grind entirely to a halt.

"I seem to have been absent-mindedly staring at the patch just above the TV for a few weeks now. The apparently compelling space where the paint isn’t even in the process of drying has been occupying most of my attention, while sounds and moving shapes – some louder and brighter than others – emit from the large shiny rectangle beneath, occasionally interrupted by an inquiry asking whether I’m still watching. And my answer is yes … sort of. It’s been hard to concentrate on the truly challenging stuff, and by “challenging”, I mean anything with more than one very straight-lined plot, or something that deviates from the kind of show where I can still tell what’s going on even after I’ve zoned out for a few moments, having been distracted by dropping half a tea-soaked digestive down my front. As much as I usually feel the need to shower after watching Saturday night ITV (a useful prompt at the moment, frankly), I’m suddenly finding Ninja Warrior UK strangely watchable. It could be the combination of swimming pools, baying crowds standing close to each other, and a commentary insinuating that any of this actually matters. More worryingly, however, it could be that I miss those guys at the gym more than I thought – the ones who gurn, say “bro” with a straight face, and pose in the mirror with their phones. Either way, this is an easy watch, especially with a glass of wine, a bowl of crisps, looking at these ripped desperados, and asking yourself, “Who’s really winning?” (It’s them.) It’s the easy telly, or things I have seen before – bringing me back to the relative comfort of my youth, or the relative comfort of, y’know, around three months ago. Shortly before lockdown, I had spied old Channel 4 hangover favourite The OC lurking on Amazon Prime, under the category, and I shit you not, “Could this BE more nostalgic?’” In due time, I managed to get past this initial hurdle, and the sun-kissed melodramas of Seth (more annoying than I remember), Ryan – who appears to wear a choker for the first season to let you know he’s from the WrongSideOfTheTracks™; Marissa (much more annoying than I remember) and Sandy Cohen’s eyebrows have returned me to a simpler time of the Killers being cutting edge and Original Penguin clothing not being something Tim Lovejoy wears. This level of comfort is only otherwise reserved for watching clips of The Big Breakfast on YouTube. There’s an especially pleasing one of Chris Evans getting hit square in the face by a snowball and storming off, but reliving Get Your Nobbly Nuts Out, and Zig and Zag in the bathroom gives me the kind of Proustian rush that not even Sandy Cohen’s eyebrows can equal. If I find myself missing actual relationships and need to be reminded that human interaction is not all it’s cracked up to be, then Judd Apatow’s Love on Netflix does the job. The deeply flawed protagonists prompt me to wince, recoil and grimace my way through three seasons of very watchable episodes, making me happy that the new normal will no longer require me to build the kind of life that adults built in the beforetimes (career, relationship, hope, etc). Instead, I can breathe a sigh of relief, happily snuffing it at my laptop way beyond current retirement age, in the middle of typing my 20th “just following up” of the day, while watching Johnny Vaughan dressed as a vicar. An honourable mention goes to what, aside from watching Boris Johnson murder oratory in front of an entire nation, is the only linear TV I’ve watched this entire time.

"Without a doubt, An Audience With Billy Connolly. The “incontinence pants” routine is such a brilliant piece of physical comedy. Friends. I love it so much. It is so wonderfully written and the gag rate is phenomenal. The writing team would work on the basis of finding multiple punchlines for each joke and it shows.  Really tough one as I have so many. Probably Blazing Saddles. So quotable, so politically incorrect yet so funny. There is a photo of me where I am wearing Bermuda shorts that have a werewolf on them with bright green sunglasses on saying “radical”. Absolutely tragic.

"The historian and broadcaster David Starkey has apologised for claiming that slavery was not genocide because of the survival of “so many damn blacks”. Starkey who made the comment on the rightwing broadcaster Darren Grimes’s online show on Thursday, said that he was “very sorry” for being “deplorably inflammatory”. The former chancellor Sajid Javid and the historian David Olusoga were among those who criticised Starkey after he told Grimes while discussing the Black Lives Matter movement: “Slavery was not genocide, otherwise there wouldn’t be so many damn blacks in Africa or in Britain would there? You know, an awful lot of them survived.” The next day, HarperCollins UK said it would not be publishing any further books by Starkey and he resigned from his honorary fellowship at Fitzwilliam College at Cambridge amid pressure on the college to cut ties with him. Canterbury Christ Church University also terminated Starkey’s role as visiting professor. On Monday, talking about his use of the phrase “so many damn blacks”, Starkey said: “It was intended to emphasise, in hindsight with awful clumsiness, the numbers who survived the horrors of the slave trade. Instead, it came across as a term of racial abuse. “This, in the present atmosphere, where passions are high and feelings raw, was deplorably inflammatory. It was a bad mistake. “I am very sorry for it and I apologise unreservedly for the offence it caused. “I have also paid a heavy price for one offensive word, with the loss of every distinction and honour acquired in a long career.” As well as lamenting the impact on his career, Starkey also claimed that if free speech “is suppressed on questions of race, resentments will fester rather than disappear. My principal regret is that my blundering use of language and the penalty it has incurred will further restrict the opportunities for proper debate.” The historian said the “misunderstanding of my words in no way reflects my views or practice on race”. However, it is not the first time he has been accused of racism. Appearing on BBC Newsnight after the summer riots of 2011, Starkey said: “A substantial amount of the chavs have become black. The whites have become black; a particular sort of violent destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion.” He also gave an interview to the Telegraph in which he said statistics “appeared” to show a black propensity to violence.",culture

"HarperCollins has dropped David Starkey as an author, saying that the racist views the bestselling historian expressed in a recent interview were “abhorrent”. On Thursday, Starkey told the rightwing commentator Darren Grimes that “slavery was not genocide, otherwise there wouldn’t be so many damn blacks in Africa or in Britain would there? You know, an awful lot of them survived.” Following widespread condemnation – former chancellor Sajid Javid described the comments as racist and “a reminder of the appalling views that still exist” in Britain, while the historian David Olusoga said they were “truly disgusting” – HarperCollins UK said it would not be publishing any further books by Starkey. “The views expressed by David Starkey in his recent interview are abhorrent and we unreservedly condemn them,” said the publisher. “Our last book with the author was in 2010, and we will not be publishing further books with him. We are reviewing his existing backlist in light of his comments and views.” Starkey was signed by HarperCollins in a four-book deal in 2006, publishing titles including Monarchy: Behind the Royal Mask from the Tudors to the Present, and Henry: Virtuous Prince, the first in a planned two-part biography of Henry VIII. It is understood that the other two titles in the deal, which included the second part of Starkey’s biography, will no longer be published by HarperCollins. The book is currently listed online as coming out in September. A spokesperson for Hodder & Stoughton, which published Starkey’s 2015 book Magna Carta, said it would also not publish him again: “We unequivocally condemn racism in any form. We published a book by David Starkey in 2015 as a one off project to mark the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta to coincide with a TV documentary. We will not be publishing any further books by him.” On Friday, Starkey also resigned from his honorary fellowship at Fitzwilliam College at Cambridge. A statement from the college said: “The Master has accepted Dr David Starkey’s resignation of his honorary fellowship with immediate effect. “Fitzwilliam prides itself in leading the way in Cambridge in opening access to higher education for under-represented groups. Our student and academic bodies are diverse and welcoming to all. We do not tolerate racism.” They added: “Honorary fellows have the same responsibility as all members of our college to uphold our values.” Canterbury Christ Church University also terminated Starkey’s role as visiting professor, saying his comments were “completely unacceptable”. Prof Rama Thirunamachandran, vice-chancellor of Canterbury Christ Church University, apologised to staff and students at the university in Kent who have been offended and upset by the “appalling” comments. He said: “Widely reported comments by historian David Starkey during a recent online interview are, in our view, completely unacceptable and do not reflect the values of our university and community.” This is not the first time Starkey has been criticised for his remarks on race. Following the summer riots in 2011, he told BBC Newsnight that “a substantial amount of the chavs have become black. The whites have become black; a particular sort of violent destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion.”",culture
"After weeks of sustained protests against anti-black racism and police brutality across America, Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to curb police violence. But “before you get excited … don’t,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show, as the order “doesn’t do much”. For example, the order promises federal grants to departments for training and certification courses. “I’m pretty sure the chant is ‘defund the police’,” said Colbert. “If you give them more funding, they’re just going to spend it on a tank called the De-Escalator 4000.” Trump also promised to ban police use of chokeholds except “if an officer’s life is at risk”, which is, as Colbert noted, “a loophole big enough to drive a squad car through”. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign continues to plan for its rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, this weekend, despite the public health risk of coronavirus and an editorial from the Tulsa World declaring “this is the wrong time and Tulsa is the wrong place for the Trump rally.” Well, “You know what they say: two wrongs make a rallyful of whites,” Colbert said. Faced with public scrutiny over the risks of crowding thousands of people together indoors during a pandemic, the campaign has promised to have hand sanitizer and face masks on hand, though they won’t be required. “Then they’re not going to wear them!” Colbert said. “Just like Trump doesn’t wear them, which puts Trump in danger, too. The president of the United States is going to be exposed to the aerosolized spittle of 19,000 people. Honest to God, how does the Secret Service allow him to do that?” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah examined Trump’s executive order, a “confusing” measure in that it discourages police use of chokeholds unless an officer felt his life was threatened, “which means the thing can be used, but it can’t be used … but it can be used”, said Noah. Noah also noted that Trump’s “heart wasn’t in” his announcement of the order, in which he constantly praised the police. “The only paper Trump has signed with less enthusiasm were his first two marriage certificates,” Noah said. Trump once again downplayed the use of excessive force by police to a “tiny” number of officers, “but, I mean, if bad cops were a minor problem, you wouldn’t have huge protests in every city,” Noah countered. “You’d just be able to point at the bad cop and be like ‘hey, Gary! Cut that shit out!’” While Trump’s executive order “clearly doesn’t have much teeth”, said Noah, some cities are taking concrete, immediate action – this week, the New York police department disbanded the 600-member plainclothes undercover unit, notorious for its excessive and discriminatory use of force, and San Francisco and Albuquerque city councils said 911 calls for situations such as drug overdoses and mental health emergencies will result in trained professionals instead of armed police. “I think we can all agree: this is long overdue in America,” Noah said of the reforms. “Police in America do too much. So if you can avoid bringing armed police to these situations in the first place, that should be the goal. Because wherever a gun is present, that means that there’s a chance the gun is going to go off. “I know this seems like a radical idea to some people,” Noah concluded of sending in unarmed police to most calls. “But if you think about it, it’s the same thing we did with Ghostbusters over 30 years ago. They used to send cops out when the ghosts showed up, and at some point they realized that the cops were not the right people to deal with the ghost issue, so they created the Ghostbusters. They didn’t have guns, they had ghost vacuum cleaners – it worked way better, and it was also funnier.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel discussed an upcoming tell-all book from the former national security adviser John Bolton, AKA “the guy who offered to testify during the impeachment trial, but the Republicans said: nah, no thanks, we’re good”. “I’ll be honest, I’ve almost forgotten about the impeachment trial,” said Kimmel. “At this point it feels like a Hulu show I was really into and then hated the ending of.” Bolton’s book is called The Room Where It Happened, a reference to the musical Hamilton, “which is kinda weird – it’s like if Woodward and Bernstein called their book Nixon Christ Superstar”. The book will supposedly expose misconduct by Trump beyond his quid pro quo phone call with Ukraine, “and while many think the president should be worried, the president thinks John Bolton should be worried”, said Kimmel. On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that conversations with him were “highly classified information” and that he hoped the book’s publication brought “criminal problems” for Bolton – made-up standards that were “rules for a bachelor party, not the law”.",culture
"Jimmy Barnes, Tina Arena, Archie Roach, Michael Gudinski, Peter Garrett, Jessica Mauboy, Savage Garden and John Farnham are among more than 1,000 artists, venues, festivals and music industry professionals who have signed an open letter urging for an immediate federal government rescue package for the music sector. The Australian music industry “fell off a cliff” when government-mandated shutdowns began on 13 March, said the open letter, which was coordinated by copyright collecting agency and music advocacy body APRA/AMCOS. Other signatories included Julia Jacklin, Reg Mombassa, Tex Perkins, Kate Miller-Heidke, Lindy Morrison and Thelma Plum. “From the smallest music venues and festivals in cities, suburbs and towns to the major concerts and events, the Australian music industry is an intricate and complex breeding ground for some of the most acclaimed live talent at home and around the world,” the letter said. “While much of the economy starts to reopen, the ongoing restrictions on large gatherings means our industry will continue to be held back from returning to work. Without immediate government intervention, the Australian music sector will be hit twice as hard as the rest of the economy and thousands of jobs will be lost within months.” The industry is calling for a suite of federal measures, including an extension of the jobkeeper program beyond September, and its expansion to gig and contract workers who would otherwise not qualify; a $40m package for music industry recovery; a boost to Australia Council funding with $70m available across art forms; and tax reform for the live performance and recording sector. The demands are part of a broader proposal by Live Performance Australia for a $345m live performance industry recovery package to see the sector through the next 12 months. The proposal includes funding for theatre, festivals, regional venues and touring as well as live music. A day earlier, a coalition of Melbourne music venues launched a petition with more than 12,000 signatures calling on the Victorian government to save live music in the state from “the brink of collapse” due to the Covid-19 shutdowns. Signatories to Melbourne venues’ Save Our Scene petition express similar concerns about the industry’s ability to recover without targeted government intervention. “Live music means mass gatherings, so it will be many months before our state’s music venues can safely reopen our doors at viable capacities. In the meantime, our venues are being crippled by mounting debt including rent, mortgage payments, bills and insurance. Without government intervention, many of the venues you love will be forced to close their doors permanently,” the petition said. The moves are part of a sustained campaign for greater support for the arts and entertainment sectors, which were one of the first to suffer the economic shock of the nationwide coronavirus shutdowns, and are expected to be hamstrung for at least as long as social distancing regulations are in force. The music industry is not alone in calling for greater support for the sector. The National Association for the Visual Arts has called for a $500m recovery fund “accessible to all arts and cultural organisations across all artforms and at all scales”, an extension of jobseeker and jobkeeper, and the doubling of Australia Council grants funding. The federal arts minister, Paul Fletcher, has defended the eligibility criteria for jobkeeper and jobseeker payments, despite them being consistently criticised by the arts and entertainment sector as inadequate for those members of its workforce in precarious employment. In an article for the Australian newspaper on Tuesday, Fletcher said there was “no basis for the urban myth that somehow the arts sector has been dudded by jobkeeper”. The federal government has also blocked attempts by the states to extend and broaden the jobkeeper subsidy. A spokesperson for Fletcher told Guardian Australia last week that the government was “looking closely at a range of sectors – including the arts and entertainment and screen sectors – which might need longer term support”.",culture
"Sydney Theatre Company’s board has addressed concerns about the company’s viability before the release of its 2019 annual report, which shows an operating loss of $7.75m and warns about its future financial position. Auditors from KPMG assessing STC’s financial statements said there was “material uncertainty” that “may cast significant doubt” on the company’s ability to continue. STC’s chair, the former Commonwealth Bank chief executive Ian Narev, said in his report that the company had embarked upon a plan to secure its future “with external advice under the Safe Harbour provisions of company law”, which allow companies to continue trading while insolvent. STC’s executive director, Patrick McIntyre, told Guardian Australia: “We’re not insolvent at the moment but, with all the revenue switched off, it’s reasonable to assume we could face some insolvency issue this calendar year. “It depends on how long the crisis goes for. I think we’re all in serious threat of going under. I think we’re a big fat canary in the coalmine.” McIntyre said the company had done everything it could to reduce costs, focused on lobbying federal and state governments for further arts relief, and worked with industry bodies to develop a plan to get back on stage. But the uncertainty was real. “Reserves have been depleted and the appetite for risk is very low – we don’t know when we’re reopening and we don’t know how audiences will respond to us reopening,” he said. “We believe that it’s in the best interest of all our stakeholders for the company to survive. That’s what the board is really focused on doing.” STC have cancelled six productions so far and reviewed staffing levels, with most permanent staff working reduced hours. Casual and contract staff employed on a show-by-show basis have lost their jobs. The company’s board of directors prepared cash-flow forecasts for 12 months based on six weeks leading up to 30 April and expectations for the months ahead. Those forecasts formed the basis of its assessment that the company was a going concern. The forecasts, however, assumed that plays would go ahead from September, and that the 2021 season would go ahead as planned. The projections also rely upon the New South Wales government being “favourably disposed” to give further financial assistance to the company, and that costs for its rebuilding project would not blow out. McIntyre said STC was “still waiting on clarity” from state and federal governments about how much assistance they would provide. “The state government has a process and they will arrive at a number and we will then configure our plans and adjust accordingly,” he said. Between 10% and 12% of STC’s revenue comes from government grants. In 2019 this amounted to $3.44m of a total $34.5m. Like most major performing arts companies in Australia, STC reports on the calendar year to align with production seasons. The company has been reporting steadily increasing losses from its core operations (the basic business of putting on theatre, before fundraising and grant revenue has been taken into account) for the past five years, from a deficit of $6.7m in 2015 to $13.3m in 2018. These have been only partially offset by revenue from government grants and philanthropy. McIntyre said the company would look at re-evaluating the size and scope of its productions when it moves back into its Wharf premises at the end of 2020 – something he maintains it is on track to do. The company vacated its premises on Pier 4/5 in the Walsh Bay arts precinct in June 2018 to make way for capital works. McIntyre said the goal of a September reopening didn’t feel “unachievable”. “The unsettling thing at the moment is we can’t have certainty on that,” he said. “We are obviously watching Victoria very carefully and considering what would happen if that were to happen in NSW as well.”",culture
"In Guardian Australia’s series, Ask A Children’s Author, writers open themselves up to questions from their young readers – about their books, about their characters, about anything at all, really. First up was Andy Griffiths – the author of the Bad Book series, the Bum series and, of course, the number one bestselling 13-Storey Treehouse series – who answered all manner of questions about writing, about his next book, and about whether or not his bum has ever come off. Then we had Garth Nix, whose bestselling books, including the Old Kingdom, Seventh Tower and Keys to the Kingdom series, are read by fantasy enthusiasts of all ages. He talked about queer representation, perfectionism and his writing tips – and answered some very curly questions too.  Now we have Alison Lester, who has been delighting younger readers – and their parents – for more than 30 years with her beautiful illustrated children’s picture books including My Farm, Imagine, and Magic Beach, as well as her board books and young adult novels.  If your child loves her stories, her illustrations, or both, and would like to ask her a question, please post it in the comments along with their first name, age and city. Or you can film them asking the question and email the video to australia.culture@theguardian.com with the subject heading “Alison Lester”.

"This was a week with some indulgently heady stuff, beginning with Szymanowski’s opera Król Roger and followed by Schoenberg’s Gurrelieder. Each deals with kings in crisis, soul-searching in their own way, in highly charged but often ecstatically beautiful music. In the radio broadcast of Royal Opera House’s 2014 production, Polish baritone Mariusz Kwiecień was a fine King Roger in a signature role for him. This king is tipped into crisis by his encounter with a crazed Dionysian figure who arrives in the guise of a shepherd and to whose seductive, hedonistic sway Roger loses his queen, Roxana. As Roger, in isolation, is gradually able to see the light and discover the potency of self-determination, the listener is drawn deeper and deeper into Szymanowski’s radiantly luxuriant score. I hadn’t even planned to listen, but found I couldn’t turn it off. Giving Schoenberg’s massive cantata the operatic treatment was a daring first for Dutch National Opera, the inspired idea of conductor Marc Albrecht, strikingly realised by director Pierre Audi. The medieval legend of King Waldemar, his love for mistress Tove and the cruelty of his murderous queen is told in a sequence of poems by Jens Peter Jacobsen: the setting of Gurre castle is atmospheric, some of the characterisation challenging, yet far from illogical. Jacobsen was a botanist who translated Darwin’s On the Origin of Species into Danish, so nature’s redemptive power is implicit in the words, as is the passion. If the mere mention of Schoenberg is a frightener, think again. This is luscious late romanticism, albeit with glimpses of the composer’s future path. Embedded in the words of Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde – translated from ancient Chinese poems – is the consoling certainty that, while man is mortal, the Earth and its song live on for ever. Today as man and climate change undermine that certainty, the music’s expressive power carries a further poignant force. In the ROH’s second livestreamed concert on 20 June (£4.99 to watch on demand), conducted by Antonio Pappano, the song-symphony was performed in the arrangement for chamber orchestra conceived in detail by Schoenberg and later completed by Rainer Riehn. The obvious version to use in the context of distancing, it highlighted the intimate relationship of the solo voices – tenor David Butt Philip and mezzo Sarah Connolly – with the instrumental soloists, all emerging with clarity and eloquently communicated. Connolly in particular sang from the heart. Compare and contrast this with Mahler’s original mega-score in Simon Rattle’s performance with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from Aldeburgh in 2011, which can be heard on Radio 3 on Tuesday evening (and then on BBC Sounds for 30 days). For those wistful about the absence of this year’s Aldeburgh festival, these repeats are timely, with Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream and an excellent cast marking the summer solstice. But his Peter Grimes staged out in the open on the North Sea shoreline will surely go down as one of the festival’s all-time memorable events. Seeing again the televised recording, with Alan Oke as Grimes, one could smell the salt tang, feel the rising wind and shiver. Under huge pressure to adapt to the present norm, podcasts are one way for organisations to sustain a profile. Welsh National Opera has launched a series – in English and in Welsh – and Longborough festival opera likewise. Theirs opens with Paul Carey Jones who would have been the much-anticipated Wotan in Die Walküre talking with conductor Anthony Negus; in another, LFO artistic director Polly Graham and David Pountney discuss comedy in Wagner. “What larks, Poll, what larks!” But it’s the Guildhall School of Music and Drama who hold all the aces in creating digital performances of their end-of-year opera double-bill. Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas is paired with La bella dormente nel bosco in a rare outing for Respighi’s witty take on the Sleeping Beauty fairytale. It’s the virtual thing in both senses and promises to be both inventive and evocative. My pick for the week ahead From Thursday 25 June, the Penarth Chamber Music festival weekend is being livestreamed, with repertoire gems by prime exponents of the genre, including David Adams, Alice Neary, Lesley Hatfield and Robert Plane.",culture
"Two terrified boys are forced out of a car by members of a gang who taunt them with the question: “Were you kissing?” A paving stone is dropped on to the head of a lesbian by one of her relatives. A man’s screaming is captured as he is raped. These “trophy videos” are the hardest thing to watch in Welcome to Chechnya: The Gay Purge, a harrowing documentary about the persecution of LGBT people in the Russian republic. The videos were made by people who hunt down and and terrorise gay Chechens, with the backing of the government and security forces. “The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, is waging a ‘blood-cleansing operation’ to eliminate all LGBT people,” says the director, David France, speaking by Zoom from his home in New York. Thanks to nationalism, religious fundamentalism and Vladimir Putin’s “gay propaganda” law, LGBT people have become scapegoats. As one of the gang members tells the boys in the car: “All our problems are because of people like you.” France decided to make his film after reading a New Yorker article that described the heroic young activists of Russia’s LGBT network, who smuggle gay Chechens out of the state and into safe houses in Moscow or St Petersburg, then supervise their journeys out of Russia to claim asylum. The documentary contains dramatic footage, captured on iPhones and GoPro cameras, of gay Chechens known to the authorities making it past border guards and police to a fragile kind of safety. “I was posing as a ridiculous American tourist,” France says. “I had two phones. One for tourist things, another for shooting the extractions. When they asked for my phone, I was able to show the one meant for their eyes, and convince them I was just a thrill-seeker.” Coming out in the UK weeks after the video of George Floyd’s murder inflamed the Black Lives Matter movement, Welcome to Chechnya shows yet again how technology can now be used to expose scenes the authorities would rather keep from view. France’s biggest challenge was preserving his subjects’ anonymity. Homosexuality is stigmatised so much in Chechnya that families are actually pressured by the security forces to murder their gay members in “honour killings”. The sense of danger is stifling. When a desperate young man slits his wrists in a safe house, his handlers and fellow residents have to patch him up themselves, as calling an ambulance would alert the authorities to their clandestine operation. France’s solution was to use something similar to deepfake technology, but in the cause of telling the truth. “We asked other real people – mostly activists, mostly LGBTQ, mostly New York – to let us film them. An algorithm then maps their faces over the faces of people in the film. It’s really a kind of digital transplant. The people are doing and saying and reacting to things in exactly the same way. They’re just wearing a different face. And in many instances, we also replaced their voices.” At the film’s dramatic high point, one of these digital faces melts away as a subject discloses his true identity at a press conference. He announces that he is going to make a criminal complaint against the Russian authorities for failing to protect him, after he was captured and tortured in Grozny, the Chechen capital. Although the Russian courts immediately dismissed his case, claiming that there was no evidence, Maxim Lapunov is going to the European court of human rights, to date the only LGBT person who has dared to make such a challenge. France says Lapunov’s position is still precarious. “He and his family moved from place to place during the prosecution of their criminal complaint, so they are still living mostly in the margins, hoping that they will see some sort of justice. I think it’s fair to say they are not yet in their ultimate destination country, where they can live a more carefree life. Right now they are not carefree at all.” France started his career on the gay press in New York in the early 80s, just as gay men in the city started dying of a mysterious and incurable disease. Welcome to Chechnya is his third film. How to Survive a Plague – his first, which he later turned into an award-winning book – told the story of how a vociferous campaign by gay activist group Act Up relentlessly pushed the US medical establishment into making drugs available for people with Aids. The fact that it is now a manageable condition rather than a death sentence is a direct result of their determination. France is currently making a film about Covid-19, and points out parallels, not least the fact that Anthony Fauci, as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was in charge during both pandemics. “Globally, the researchers responsible for bringing about the miracle drugs in 1996 are still working today. There’s been a massive 30-year effort to find a vaccine against HIV, all of which has proved a failure so far. But the growth of knowledge in the field of vaccinology has been driven by the people doing HIV work. Those people immediately turned their attentions to Covid.” Back then, France says, Fauci was seen as a villain by Aids activists. “He could have saved tens of thousands of lives by directing his research dollars into ways that would prevent the opportunistic infections which were actually killing people with Aids. He was financing all sorts of biochemical research into attacking HIV, and not prioritising any monies into keeping people alive. And it’s not that it didn’t occur to him – activists were protesting at his door, calling him a murderer. He wouldn’t do it based on some kind of academic interpretation of his job – he felt it wasn’t his place to tell researchers what to research.” Today, France believes Fauci’s handling of coronavirus shows how much those Aids activists taught him. “I think the funding that’s coming out of the National Institute of Health is good. The budget priorities seem strong. What we would love is some sort of direct confrontation with Donald Trump, but he would argue that as long as he’s able to stay on the taskforce, he’s helping.” Having lived through one deadly pandemic, does he see any grounds for optimism about this one? “The science is there to help us in a way it wasn’t when HIV hit,” he says. Back then, “the field of immunology was still pretty young, the field of human retroviruses was brand new. Now we have experience working with coronaviruses. People had anticipated a coronavirus like this, so there was some preparatory work. I know they are feeling confident. So that gives me confidence.” However, France believes that a vaccine for Covid-19 may prove as elusive as one for HIV. “I think that this coronavirus will be with us for ever and we have to find a way to accommodate it.” There’s another echo of the Aids era in the stunning success of activists today – in this case Black Lives Matter exposing structural bigotry, not least in matters of health provision, given that black people are far more likely to die of Covid-19. “I know that Black Lives Matter has studied the Act Up model of activism,” says France, pointing out that its leadership includes queer and trans people. What makes a social justice movement successful? “Act Up teaches us that it’s not enough to demand something from others. The movement – which started as an organising idea to bring people to the streets to have their voices heard – had to join as partners with the people who could make the change. Black Lives Matter has been able to use the ability to fill the streets as a way to force doors open for the leadership to sit at the table.” In some ways, the spirits of Black Lives Matter and Act Up converge in the figure of Marsha P Johnson, the black trans woman who was at the Stonewall riot in 1969, which sparked the modern movement for gay rights. The subject of France’s 2016 film, The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson, drowned in murky circumstances in 1992. Her death was ruled a suicide and not properly investigated by the NYPD, but most of her friends believe she was murdered. Johnson – and her Latinx sidekick Sylvia Rivera, who crashed the 1973 New York gay pride parade to excoriate its middle-class whiteness and desire to marginalise trans people – loudly expressed the belief that liberation would only be possible when all LGBT people around the world were free. “It’s still illegal to be gay in 70 countries,” says France. “And in eight or more, it’s punishable by death. What’s going on in Chechnya is a campaign to root out and murder anybody they think is LGBTQ.” And while that’s the case, the fight must go on.",culture
"Jimmy Kimmel offered the week’s award for “most ‘stooped’”, to quote Donald Trump’s misspelling of stupid on Twitter, to the president’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who “astonished even the most hardened among us” when he repeatedly answered “I do not” to the question “Do you believe there’s systemic racism against African Americans in the US?” “Sir, one more question: can you name a black person?” asked Kimmel. Kudlow’s answers were “so stupid I don’t think even Donald Trump would say it”. “This, by the way, is the same guy who said coronavirus was ‘contained’ three months ago, and he’s still there, reporting for duty. Only the best people,” Kimmel added. “On the other side of the coin – the side Lincoln is on,” Nascar announced this week it will no longer allow Confederate flags at its races. “So Nascar now has done more to fight racism than the president has,” Kimmel said. On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed “one of the biggest shifts” accomplished by the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police: the removal of Confederate monuments. This week, demonstrators removed a statue of Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, in Richmond, Virginia, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called on Congress to remove 11 Confederate statues at the Capitol. “Why did Congress have Confederate statues in the first place?” Noah wondered. “I mean, the Confederacy fought against America, so why would you have statues of them in America’s Capitol building? That makes no sense. It’s like white ladies having statues of gluten in their kitchen. “It’s a little insane how it feels like the government treats actual traitors better than black citizens,” Noah continued. “George Floyd maybe had a $20 bill that was counterfeit – he gets choked to death. The president of the Confederacy was responsible for half a million dead Americans, and the response is, ‘Let’s ask the quarry for the finest piece of marble, we’ve gotta remember this guy!’” And the army announced it would consider removing the names of Confederate officers from military bases. “I know for some people this debate might seem inconsequential,” Noah said, “but you gotta understand: the reason the military generals are open to changing the names of these bases is the same reason that Nascar is doing it – they want the military to take a unified stand against racism, and they want to show that the American military stands for all Americans, including the millions of minorities who have served within its ranks.” “Protests are continuing all over America, and if that makes you nervous, you might be a Confederate statue,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show, who called the army’s idea to remove Confederate leaders’ names from its bases “reasonable, considering those men waged war on the US military”. The bases were named at the height of Jim Crow, “so this seems like a slam dunk”, Colbert said. “Only someone completely tone deaf to the continuing pain of black Americans, who make up 20% of the US army, would disagree.” Of course, Trump disagreed and tweeted that the Confederate-honoring bases are part of a “Great American Heritage” and a “history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom”. “First, they didn’t fight for freedom,” Colbert retorted. “Second, winning and victory are the same thing, and the Confederacy didn’t do either of them. You’d know that if you weren’t stupid and an idiot.” Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign has planned a bus tour of several states despite the risks of coronavirus spreading in mass gatherings. “I guess he just misses walking out to a large crowd that he hasn’t teargassed,” said Colbert. His first rally is scheduled for 19 June, AKA Juneteenth, the annual holiday commemorating the end of slavery in America, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which 99 years ago this month was the site of one of the bloodiest, most destructive weeks of racial violence in the US, when white mobs destroyed “Black Wall Street”. “Now, to be fair, there’s no way Trump knows that much American history,” Colbert said. “I’m pretty sure he just told Stephen Miller, ‘Steve, just pick the most offensive date and location you can think of, and put it up there on my Hooters calendar.’” On Late Night, Seth Meyers reviewed the latest dismal polls for Trump, which show that his “political standing has eroded considerably over the past month”. “So Trump and his supporters in the GOP and on rightwing TV are resorting to the only two tactics they have left: amping up the racism and nursing deranged cultural grievances,” Meyers said. For example, after the army said they would consider renaming bases named after Confederate leaders, Trump tweeted a nonsensical dissent, which White House staffers printed out and handed to reporters at a briefing. “What do you mean they’re part of a ‘great American heritage’, a history of ‘winning, victory and freedom’?” Meyers wondered. “Confederates famously fought against America, and they lost. Since when do we name military bases after people who lost wars against America. Is there a naval base named after King George III? Would you make American soldiers train at Fort Il Duce? “I honestly can’t even believe it’s a question at this point whether or not we should be celebrating the symbols of an explicitly white supremacist cause like the Confederacy that fought to destroy the United States,” Meyers said. “And yet Nascar,” which banned the presence of Confederate flags at its races this week, “is doing more to lead right now than the president of the United States.”",culture
"“It’s been a truly brutal week, with protests across the country in response to the horrific killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police,” said John Oliver on Sunday’s Last Week Tonight, which was taped, he noted on Twitter, on Saturday morning (“that’s never great, and this week, it’s especially not-great.”) “There is clearly a lot to discuss here: how these protests are a response to a legacy of police misconduct both in Minneapolis and in the nation at large, and how that misconduct is in and of itself built on a legacy of white supremacy that prioritizes the comfort of white Americans over the safety of people of color. There is so much to say here – some of it complicated, much of it all too clear.  “Or, you know, you could just go on TV, open up your mouth, and let this shit fall out,” he said before playing a clip of Fox News host and “human boat shoe” Tucker Carlson. “Rioting is the one thing you don’t want,” Carlson said on his show over footage from violent clashes between police and protesters in Minneapolis. Carlson compared the violent protests with the now-infamous incident in Central Park last week in which a white woman called the cops on a black birdwatcher, who asked her to leash her dog, and feigned hysteria to gain a swift police response. “Ugly opinions, police brutality, officious birdwatchers, rude and entitled ladies walking their dogs in big-city parks – all of that is bad. But none of it is nearly as bad as what you just saw,” Carlson said. “OK, first: fuck you, Tucker,” Oliver responded. “That’s just a general point. Second, saying ‘officious birdwatcher’ is deeply offensive – because you’re either trying to both-sides that Central Park incident or insulting fans of this show, who proudly call themselves ‘officious birdwatchers’. I am the ‘officious bird’; they are the ‘watchers.’ Keep their name out of your mouth.” “People like Tucker love to venerate order at moments like this, and that’s easy to do when order in its current form is designed to benefit and protect you,” Oliver continued. “But it’s hard to overstate how clearly we’ve been reminded lately of the hostility of our existing order toward black people who’ve been killed by police on the street [George Floyd], killed by police in their own home [emergency room technician Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police on 13 March in Louisville], “killed by wannabe police in the street [Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot and killed while jogging in February by two white men in Georgia], and threatened with state violence while literally birding [Christian Cooper, the birdwatcher in Central Park]. “Collectively, that has just got to be some brutality bingo right there.” “And when ‘order’ results in you lying face-down on a lawn while your grandma stands between you and the police who have pulled their guns on you after you allegedly just rolled a stop sign,” he continued, in reference to Tye Anders, a 21-year-old Texan arrested in a terrifying ordeal with police in May. “I can see why being lectured on the importance of ‘order’ at the expense of all else is just not what you want to fucking hear right now!” And the president, Oliver noted, is baiting – the host pointed to his tweet from the weekend (which Twitter sanctioned for “glorifying violence”) in which he called the protesters “thugs” and said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “When a man like Donald Trump uses the word ‘thugs’, you know exactly what it’s code for,” said Oliver. “‘When the looting starts, the shooting starts,’ is actually a quote from a notoriously racist 1960s Miami police chief. And it is truly astounding how Donald Trump has managed to live 74 years with a remedial understanding of spelling, grammar, geography, science, civics nutrition and child development, and yet he’s the fucking Library of Alexandria when it comes to racist maxims of the 20th century.” Oliver’s main segment concerned the less explosive but extremely important issue of mail-in voting – the same issue which garnered Trump’s other Twitter censure last week, for his erroneous claim that it’s “substantially fraudulent”. Mail-in voting is actually common in many states with both Republican and Democratic-leaning governments, “and if this pandemic continues into the fall, as it most certainly will, many voters will want to do exactly that”, said Oliver. “Because think about it: holding an in-person election during a pandemic is an absolute nightmare. “The question isn’t ‘should we have voting by mail’ at all, because we already do,” Oliver explained. “It’s ‘how hard should we make it?’” That question depends on where you live – some states have significant restrictions on mail-in voting, such as Alabama, which requires mail-in ballots to include a photocopy of one’s state ID and a notary signed by two witnesses. Voter fraud is thus a crime that is “difficult, high-risk and low reward”, said Oliver. “It’s as if at the end of Ocean’s Eight, we learned that Sandra Bullock had gone to all the trouble of breaking into the Met Gala to steal a map of state’s quarters.” And while advocates argue that it will reduce obstacles to civic participation, “that in and of itself may be why it’s become so controversial”, Oliver said. “Conservative opponents often speculate that any increased participation would benefit Democrats despite the fact that researchers have consistently found that hasn’t obviously helped one party or the other.” The attempts to discredit mail-in voting during a pandemic is why “now is absolutely the time to talk about this,” Oliver concluded. “You cannot prepare for an election the same way you update your computer’s software, by just putting it off for months on end and secretly hoping that maybe you’ll be dead before you actually have to deal with it. We need to get this right, now.”",culture
"In March, a week after I went to a bar, saw live music and hugged my friends for what would be the last time in months, I invited six new friends into my lounge room, and their arguments and cackles would become the soothing soundtrack to my lockdown. With a new season of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills‌ scheduled to start in April and a clear social calendar for the foreseeable future, I decided to befriend Kyle Richards and her sister Kim, Camille Grammer (then-wife of Frasier star Kelsey), Adrienne Maloof, Taylor Armstrong and Lisa Vanderpump, the namesake and matriarch of my (other) favourite show about terrible people getting into arguments, Vanderpump Rules.  I’d seen enough reality TV shows – including the antipodean spinoffs of Andy Cohen’s Housewives franchise set in Melbourne, Sydney and Auckland – to know that I couldn’t just jump into the new season without first familiarising myself with the women and their personal histories (and feuds). I’m nothing if not a completist. Just as the mid-aughts success of The OC inspired the “reality” equivalent Laguna Beach – which spun off into The Hills, which spun off into myriad less-entertaining shows about individual characters – so too did the original season of Real Housewives take its cues from the hugely popular, fictionalised shows Desperate Housewives and Peyton Place. Behind the towering double doors of mega-mansions, we were told, were the wives wealthy men (aside from a few encounters with other women, Housewives are always in heterosexual partnerships) whose friendships and social dealings were much messier than their surface sheen would have you believe. In Beverly Hills, it’s all done against the backdrop of Hollywood, which makes it all the more insidious and excellent. The Richards sisters, Kyle and Kim, grew up as child stars in the town, and are introduced alongside flashbacks to their roles in Halloween (Kyle), Nanny and the Professor (Kim) and Little House on the Prairie (both), as well as family photos with their nieces, Paris and Nicky Hilton. Camille invites the women to see her husband’s Broadway show during season one, before his affair comes to light and their marriage breakdown becomes a plot point on the show and in the tabloids.  In later seasons, soap stars Eileen Davidson and Lisa Rinna join the cast, along with Garcelle Beauvais (Coming to America) and Denise Richards, whose bitchy eyebrow is as powerful in a talking head confession in 2020 as it was in the films Wild Things, Starship Troopers and Drop Dead Gorgeous. These women’s careers exist in a vast universe outside of this reality show, which mirrors the joy of consuming Real Housewives. The fun of an empire like this one is in the communal shorthand it breeds in fellow fans: you cannot Housewives alone. During the first socially distanced walk I took with a friend in April, we discussed the latest events in Vanderpump Rules, Summer House and Real Housewives of New York. In the park, we ran into another of my friends who was dying for someone with whom she could debrief on Beverly Hills’ fourth wall-breaking season premiere. From two metres away, I watched these two go from strangers to people with a shared language in minutes. During this marathon viewing event, I became fluent in the language of Beverly Hills. I saw Taylor Armstrong’s tortured argument that would go on to spawn the “woman yelling at cat” meme. I saw the famed Dinner Party From Hell episode where host Camille referred to a guest who had posed for Playboy following the OJ Simpson trial as “the morally corrupt Faye Resnick”. And, during the same dinner, I watched as Allison DuBois, the real-life inspiration for Patricia Arquette’s character in the scripted drama Medium, puffed on an e-cigarette (in 2010!) and, after throwing back cocktails in frosted martini glasses all night, got into a verbal brawl with Kyle Richards before saying, “I can tell you when she will die, and what will happen to her family. I love that about me!”  And after that, there were 10 more seasons waiting for me. There’s no time wasted scrolling Netflix for something new to watch when you’re only in season four and the housewives are on their way to Gigi Hadid’s graduation party where they’ll argue over a possibly cursed necklace! It’s difficult to put my finger on why shows like this are appealing enough to keep me from even considering watching anything else for the past few months (I still haven’t seen Tiger King, but based on the memes I have questions about Carole) because, on paper, they shouldn’t appeal to anyone with a brain or a heart. They paint a picture of women’s lives as consumerist fantasy where collecting more wealth and fame are the ultimate goal and displaying any social or political awareness can brand you an outcast. The highlight in each season is usually a dinner party, trip overseas or cocktail function to launch a boutique/real estate agency/fundraising effort/skincare line/rosé collaboration/dog rescue centre where people scream, dredge up past grudges and point fingers.  Keeping track of these feuds and friendships constitutes the most fun I’ve had in my house all year.",culture
"Stephen Colbert returned to The Late Show from a 10-day vacation to an America on fire, and addressed “the story that has pushed 100,000 Covid deaths below the fold … America’s pre-existing condition: racism”. The protests in dozens of cities have stemmed from what Colbert called the “extrajudicial execution” of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, a white on-duty Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. “Now, in civilized countries, that’s called murder,” said Colbert. And yet, despite video evidence of the entire interaction, it took four days for Chauvin to be arrested and charged with third-degree murder; the three other officers involved, who watched but did not intervene, have not been charged with any crime. “So if you’re wondering why people are so upset, it’s because this is so upsetting.” Floyd’s killing comes on the heels of the murder of Breonna Taylor, an emergency technician shot by police in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, in April, and Ahmaud Arbery, shot by two white men in Georgia while out for a jog in February, which “also has eerie similarities to Eric Garner in 2014”, said Colbert. “And in that same year there was the case of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Tamir Rice in Cleveland. All of those echo Emmett Till and the Scottsboro Boys, which happened in the context of Jim Crow, which itself was a soft relaunch of slavery. So you’ve really got to go back to the Triangle trade, which ultimately stems from man’s inhumanity to man, and our essential fallen nature. So, maybe start with the Garden of Eden.” The point is: this is nothing new, and “we need empathetic and moral leadership. Unfortunately, we have Donald Trump.  “Now, I make a lot of jokes about Donald Trump because he is a dull and dark corrupting force that is undermining America’s moral leadership around the world and sowing hatred and fear among his own citizens,” said Colbert. “And during this Covid crisis, the president has totally abdicated his responsibility of leading the people to understand the need to do the right thing for themselves and each other. And yet, the large majority of Americans have done the right thing anyway. And my hope is that the American people will do the same thing now, because ultimately, they have to.  “For too long, those of us with opportunity and privilege have failed in our responsibility to look at the truth squarely and name the system of racial oppression that artificially divides Americans and benefits those already in positions of relative power,” Colbert continued. “It’s time to ask ourselves, as it is always time to ask ourselves, what kind of nation do we want to live in? That answer requires moral leadership. So take it upon yourself to be a leader and set an example for the kind of country you want to live in.” “If you had any doubts at all about the dangers of our overly militarized police culture, those doubts were answered in the response to nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night, citing numerous examples of police being “needlessly violent” or escalating encounters with peaceful protesters for seemingly no reason.  “The police can’t even get through protests about police brutality without committing more police brutality,” he said. “It’s like if your wife accused you of having an affair in divorce court, and you tried to smooth it over by seducing the judge. “Even just showing up to a protest in riot gear with military equipment is a form of escalation,” Meyers continued as he played footage from police rolling through the streets of Columbia, South Carolina, with a tank. “Ask yourself: why do local police departments have tanks when doctors and nurses can’t even get masks and gowns? We spend billions on military equipment for police and healthcare workers have to wear snorkel masks like retirees on vacation in the Caribbean. There are teachers in this country who are drowning in debt and have to spend their own money on supplies for their classrooms. If anyone deserves a tank, it’s them.” We know police escalation isn’t necessary, Meyers added, because “just a few weeks ago, police were physically confronted by angry rightwing protesters calling for an end to lockdowns, and oddly, they seemed to have left their tanks and teargas at home.” In the face of police escalation, “the very least we can do, the absolute minimum, is to acknowledge there is a deeply rooted, systemic problem here,” Meyers concluded, which is “that there’s a predatory system with a history of police misconduct built on a legacy of racism and exploitation that elevates the comfort and security of white people over the health and safety of black people”. And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon offered “a different kind of show” – a mea culpa after it was reported last week that Fallon had once donned blackface to impersonate Chris Rock during his time at Saturday Night Live. Fallon said he was “horrified” that the story emerged, “not at the fact that people were trying to cancel me or cancel the show, which is scary enough, but the thing that haunted me the most was how do I say: ‘I love this person? I respect this guy more than I respect most humans. I am not racist, I don’t feel this way.’  “Instead, what I kept getting advised was to just stay quiet and not say anything,” Fallon said. “And that’s the advice because we’re all afraid. And I took it for a minute.” Fallon explained that he thought, “I’m going to say something and get myself into even more trouble … I don’t know what to do,” but “realized that I can’t not say I’m horrified and I’m sorry.” The “breaking my own silence”, he said, pointed him in the direction of experts such as the NAACP president, Derrick Johnson, his guest on the show, who made him realize that “the silence is the biggest crime that white guys like me and the rest of us are doing”. “We need to say something, we need to keep saying something. And we need to say ‘that’s not OK’ more than just one day on Twitter,” Fallon urged. “We can’t just hope that everyone loves each other. We can’t say, ‘be the change.’”",culture
"My friend and fellow poet Glenn Carmichael, who has died aged 65 of liver cancer, was a radiant light in British performance poetry. He was charismatic, generous, funny and damn cool; the man who introduced poetry slamming to Bristol and kickstarted the city’s performance poetry scene. He encouraged many people to develop their careers as poets and writers. Glenn was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the youngest of three children of Nigel, a railway technician, and Marjorie (nee Payne), district manager for Avon Cosmetics. He went to Branksome secondary school (now Branksome comprehensive) in Darlington, County Durham. He studied sculpture at Cardiff School of Art and Design and was exhilarated by the punk explosion. His performance career began in London in 1978 when he fronted the Twilight Zoners (providing vocals as Gordon Twilight). In 1981, Glenn formed a rap band, the White Brothers, with Kevin “Spider” Evans. Along with Dave Littler, the trio supported such bands as A Certain Ratio, Funkapolitan and Bauhaus. Glenn greatly admired the American Beat poets and, in 1988, he and Spider became a performance duo, the Big City Beats. They ran the Hard Edge Club in Soho for five years and showcased top performance poets. After a spell in rehab, Glenn arrived in Bristol in 1993, keen to energise performance poetry. The city was heady with trip-hop, and Glenn was in the right place at the right time. In 1994, he witnessed his first poetry slam at Glastonbury festival and realised this was the way forward. In the same year, he entered the Nuyorican Poetry Slam in New York (he was runner-up), then organised a slam at the Arnolfini centre in Bristol. It was a massive success and the Bristol Poetry Slam was born. Glenn and his co-host, Claire Williamson, ran intercity slams, the UK Poetry Slam Championships 1997 and events with luminaries such as John Cooper Clarke and Brett Anderson, and took slamming to hundreds of schools. He and I enjoyed a close creative alliance, launching Pimp$ of the Alphab£t Press and touring collaborative spoken-word shows, The Truth Is Optional (1996), and later Flash and Count Me In with Lucy English. Glenn’s novel Still Searching for the Big City Beats (2000), written with Spider, is regarded as a cult classic and is the first British novel to use the spoken-word scene as its backdrop. An inspirational teacher, he taught novel writing for the Workers’ Educational Association from 2001, on what was roundly regarded as a brilliant course. “It was the beginning of it all for me,” says Emma Smith-Barton, shortlisted for the Waterstones children’s book prize 2020. Glenn completed an MA in creative writing at Bath Spa University in 2016. At the time of his death, he was writing a new novel, Nobody Came. Glenn is survived by his wife, Juliet (nee Hutchinson), whom he met at a film-showing at Watershed Media Centre, Bristol, in 2003 and married in 2005, and his sister, Rae.",culture
"On Tuesday’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert addressed the fallout from Donald Trump’s latest shocking distraction tactic: his claim to reporters on Monday that he’s taking the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine – a drug the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specifically advised not to take for coronavirus as it has potentially lethal side-effects – as protection. “Look, I don’t care how you feel politically, we have to protect the president of the United States. There’s just no way to dismiss the seriousness of death,” Colbert said, then cut to a clip of Trump telling reporters off-handedly: “Death is death.” “I stand corrected,” said Colbert. Trump’s claim alarmed several public health officials, as well as the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who told CNN’s Anderson Cooper she was concerned the president would take an unrecommended, potentially dangerous drug “especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group – what is morbidly obese, they say”. “Oh, that is a very polite way to say a mean thing,” said Colbert, imitating Pelosi. “I’m concerned about the president because he is, shall we say, 20lb of pudding in a 10lb sack. What I’m saying is, your president is so fat that when he sits around the White House, he – shall I put this diplomatically? – sits around the White House, which is a very, very large building indeed.” Pelosi’s comments were panned by many, and “it’s important to point out that fat-shaming is wrong”, Colbert noted. “Plenty of wonderful people are old and fat and beloved, like Santa. But guess what? Santa shouldn’t take hydroxychloroquine either.” Asked about Pelosi’s comments by a reporter, Trump retorted: “I don’t respond to her, I think she’s a waste of time.” Trump should know, Colbert said, as “he is the world’s leading authority on wasting time. This one time, there was this huge, deadly global pandemic and he didn’t do anything about it for like two months! It was a personal best in being just the worst.” “Are you serious? Trump has been experimenting with hydroxychloroquine?” Trevor Noah said on the Daily Show on Trump’s explosive comments. “At this point, what unhealthy thing isn’t Trump doing?” he added. “He’s taking hydroxychloroquine, he eats fast food every day, and yet he is still alive? I wouldn’t be surprised if one day we find an ancient cave painting and right in the middle of all the cavemen we find Trump, ‘fake news’, ‘I never touched that dinosaur’.” No one knows if Trump is telling the truth about taking the drug, Noah continued. “Maybe he’s trying to distract from the inspector general story, or from all the coronavirus deaths, or from the fact that his most trusted adviser is actually one of those South Korean soccer dolls,” said Noah, referring to Jared Kushner. “We’ll never know. “So Trump is either taking a dangerous, ineffective drug or he’s lying about doing it just for the LOLs,” Noah added. As for Pelosi’s comments on the matter, Noah could only facepalm. “Mocking the president’s weight also makes a lot of people who aren’t Trump feel like shit too,” he said. “So please, just remember: Trump’s not an asshole because of what goes into his mouth. He’s an asshole because of what comes out of it.” “You have to hand it to Trump – just when you think it can’t get any crazier, he starts popping FDA-disapproved drugs and telling everyone else to try it, too,” said Jimmy Kimmel on the hydroxychloroquine fiasco. “Our president is a hydroxymoron. It’s hard to process but are we surprised that the guy who thought windmills caused cancer thinks a lupus drug kills coronavirus?” To be fair, Kimmel continued, “I don’t think Trump has any idea what drugs he takes every day. He’s like a dog – Mike Pompeo just puts the pills in peanut butter and feeds it to him.” So why say he’s taking an unproven drug? Kimmel thought about it for awhile, he said, and came to the “the only reasonable conclusion: he’s trying to kill himself. “Remember how we all said he didn’t really want to be president?” Kimmel said. “Well guess what, I think we were right.” Kimmel joked that Trump is trying to end his presidency with the dangerous drug, since “he’s done everything possible to make sure no one would ever want to vote for him again: he colluded with Russia, he extorted Ukraine, he declared his love for Kim Jong-un, he made fun of John McCain, he threw paper towels at Puerto Ricans, he paid off a porn star, in the middle of a pandemic, he wants to reopen the mall. “The man stared directly into an eclipse, and none of it worked – he’s still popular, and he’s still trapped in that White House, and there’s only one way out now: a big glass of bleach with a hydro and Z-pack chaser.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers traced Trump’s hydroxychloroquine comments back to his long history of shilling scammy products, such as Trump Vodka and Trump University. Given his track record, Meyers said, it makes sense that Trump would claim to personally take a potentially dangerous drug he’s been hawking as a miracle cure for weeks, citing “I get a lot of positive calls about it” as evidence. “Your evidence is that you hear good stories and get positive calls about it … we’re talking about a potentially dangerous medication, not the new hibachi place in town,” said Meyers. “Look, Trump’s gonna say and do crazy shit,” Meyers added. “He failed on the pandemic response and unemployment is at its highest point in 100 years, so now he’s spraying ink in the water so he can dart under a rock before the press can figure out what happened. We don’t have to spend all day dissecting it, debating whether it’s a chess move or a planned distraction – the guy doesn’t play chess. He doesn’t even know how to close an umbrella. Watching him play chess would be like asking your dog to change the channel on the remote control.” The drug’s benefits are unproven, Meyers continued, and side-effects can include agitation, confusion, insomnia, mania, hallucinations and paranoia. “So either Trump’s lying about taking it … or he’s been taking it for 73 years.”",culture
"Bafflingly left off Pop – it was released on the B-side of Staring at the Sun – North and South of the River is audibly better than swathes of that album: a low-key excursion into something resembling trip-hop, replete with breakbeat and lo-fi orchestral samples and particularly yearning Bono vocal. If All That You Can’t Leave Behind returned U2 to something like their pre-Achtung Baby selves, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb’s roaring lead single took them back even further: inspired once more by the Sex Pistols and Buzzcocks, it stripped their sound to its elemental punk roots: one guitar, bass, drums. Once they had shaken off their youthful obsession with Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, U2 seldom sounded like anyone other than U2. In a Little While, however, has a 70s Rolling Stones feel to it. Subsequently covered by both Hanson and William Shatner, it’s a lovely, loose ode to enduring romance. U2’s debut single is very much a product of its era, further bedevilled by the difficult recording session at which the band’s own technical limitations were revealed. Re-recorded for 1980’s Boy, however, Out of Control shone, its blazing youthful power fully revealed itself. The contents of Songs of Innocence were overshadowed by the controversy over its means of distribution – oddly enough, not everyone wanted a U2 album to automatically appear in their iTunes library – but they were better than the reviews suggested: produced by Danger Mouse, Sleep Like a Baby Tonight’s lambent tune and electronic pulse deserve reassessment. Another song worth salvaging from the wreckage of Pop, the drum machine-driven The Playboy Mansion is raggedly charming, its lyrics casting an ambiguous eye over media bombardment, celebrity and advertising, its guitar snaking around Bono’s low-key vocal. U2’s contribution to the soundtrack of Batman Forever might well be their own charming homage to Marc Bolan, albeit put through a distinct Zooropa-era filter: the string arrangement is pure Children of the Revolution, the guitars crunch very T Rex-ily, there’s a distinct hint of a “glam descend” chord sequence about the chorus. Cursed with the kind of title guaranteed to get U2 naysayers rolling their eyes, Cedars of Lebanon is nevertheless one of No Line on the Horizon’s scattered highlights: sonically muted and misty, the vocals oddly conversational, its tone weary and sombre, it feels focused and potent where the rest of the album feels confused. Kraftwerk apparently lurked among the regular musical diet of the nascent U2, but it took until 2014 for their influence to really make itself heard. Invisible’s blend of classic U2-isms with motorik drums and Autobahn synths is the most successful of their recent attempts to reboot their sound. There’s a sense that U2’s vast commercial success means their willingness to experiment gets overlooked, but The Joshua Tree’s second side is thick with impressive diversions into the musical left field, as evidenced by its closing track’s ominous, chilling ambient noise. As befits a song originally intended for Frank Sinatra, Stay pared back the sonic overload of much of Zooropa, leaving U2 more or less au naturel. Its live sound bolsters the song’s beautifully elegant, elegiac, small-hours tone, its lyric inspired by the plot of the Wim Wenders film they wrote it for. At the other extreme to Gloria’s breast-beating lurked October’s title track, an austere, suitably autumnal-sounding piano ballad in which Bono’s vocals arrive only in the final 50 seconds. “Joy Division had gone to our heads,” shrugged the singer years later, but there’s a hushed, stark beauty to the track. U2’s most recent albums have been marred by the audible sense of a band trying too hard, but Songs of Experience’s highlight felt effortless. Its shifts from soft and sad to rousing are the sound of a band not worrying about their place in the modern pop landscape and being themselves. A fantastic example of Achtung Baby’s ability to adapt current musical trends so they fit into U2’s universe, rather than vice-versa, the shuffling, vaguely “baggy” dance rhythm here supports a retelling of the story of Judas Iscariot, a song that alternately broods and soars and a particularly sky-scraping Edge solo. The song that in effect sent U2 supernova plays fast and loose with the facts of Martin Luther King’s murder – he was shot in the afternoon, not the morning – but it hardly matters. As straightforward a lunge for anthem status as they had yet recorded, Pride worked. Either a paean to Bono’s goggle-eyed first trip to London, or a description of Manhattan, City of Blinding Lights isn’t about taking risks so much as U2 doing what U2 were put on Earth to do – make music that’s atmospheric but anthemic, uplifting but soul-searching – and doing it absolutely perfectly. Julian Schnabel’s The Diving Bell and the Butterfly features a scene soundtracked by Ultraviolet: the film’s paralysed protagonist remembering a car journey with his lover, her hair flowing in the wind. It is an extraordinary piece of film-making that perfectly captures Ultraviolet’s power, the most musically uplifting of U2’s examinations of faith. Pop is generally regarded as U2’s latter-day nadir: its recording was rushed, its attempt at grafting samples and loops on to U2’s sound ungainly, and even its title managed to upset US rock fans. But occasionally, it worked, as on Mofo, an improbably titled song about the death of Bono’s mother, complete with thrilling, Giorgio Moroder-ish synth line. U2 have been resident in the world’s stadiums for so long, it is easy to forget they were once a post-punk band. (They would doubtless argue they still are.) It is very clear here, a song about alienation and electro-convulsive therapy, vocals hidden amid trebly, reverb-heavy guitars, drums heavy on tom-tom thunder. At the other emotional extreme to Beautiful Day lies All That You Can’t Leave Behind’s anguished response to the death of Michael Hutchence. More complex and affecting than a standard issue tear-jerker, its lyric keeps shifting from sadness and empathy to anger at its subject: “You’re such a fool.” Zooropa was Achtung Baby’s scrappier sibling: if you wanted evidence of the distance U2 had travelled in recent years, the title track’s experimental, episodic collision of ambience, distorted vocals and densely affected guitar was a good place to start. Moreover, they somehow did it without surrendering their, well, U2-ness. Inspired by a trip to El Salvador, Bullet the Blue Sky’s tribal drums, dub bass and arcs of guitar noise sound like a bold attempt to turn the experiments of post-punk into something stadium-sized. Extra fun can be had imagining Mark E Smith’s reaction when he learned the chorus was based on a Fall track. U2’s second album could have been their last – a confused exploration of spirituality, it nearly pre-empted a split – but when it worked, as on towering opener Gloria, it underlined what a different proposition U2 were. Who else among their peers would write an open-hearted, earnest celebration of Christian faith? Not all of U2’s recent lunges for contemporaneity have worked (who in their right minds wants to hear Bono singing through Auto-Tune?) but Songs of Innocence’s concluding duet with Lykke Li did. A slow drift that never deals directly with the conflict in the title, but focuses on the impact that growing up near conflict has on one’s personality. From its opening blast of chaotic guitar, The Fly boldly announces things are not as they were in the world of U2. Out goes earnestness that could border on painful, in come more murky, ambiguous songs sung in character. “Conscience can be a pest,” offers Bono, as if starkly critiquing his former self, “ambition bites the nails of success.” Rattle and Hum marked the point at which U2 allowed their passion and self-belief – and indeed their reaction to superstardom – to slip into bombast, but sometimes its experiments with US roots music work. Fizzing with their enthusiasm for music forbidden under post-punk’s rules, Desire’s irresistible Bo Diddley beat is evidence. Inspired by the rise in heroin use in 80s Dublin, Bad looms large in U2 legend. The original is hypnotic and slow-burning, delicately shaded with Brian Eno’s electronics, the perfect launchpad for onstage development. Most famously, they played it for 12 minutes at Live Aid, a performance they thought was a disaster, but which turned out to be a highlight. U2’s first truly great song was a product of its era – Public Image-esque guitars, the vocal influence of Siouxsie particularly evident on the chorus, a hint of DIY experimentation in its percussive use of cutlery and a bicycle wheel – but it hoisted its influences into the service of music expressly built for crowds to sing along and punch the air to. The unexpected result of Adam Clayton attempting, and failing, to play the bass line to Visage’s Fade to Grey, U2’s breakthrough hit had what Bono admitted was a sketchy lyric about Poland’s political upheavals. It didn’t matter: its anthem status rests on the emotional shift between the jagged iciness of its verses and the warmth and yearning of the chorus. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb’s greatest track remains Bono’s rumination on his complex relationship with his dying father. It’s the perfect counter-argument to those who feel U2’s music exists solely on a grand scale, painted in emotional brushstrokes too broad for its own good. Incisive and personal, it is heartbreakingly frank. Achtung Baby’s singles employed a lot of hip dance remixers: the shimmering synths and falsetto vocals of Zooropa’s Lemon seemed to seamlessly integrate the sound of a hip dance remix into U2’s own. It is helped by the fact the song itself is great; you could strip it of its production and it would still work. Returning to Achtung Baby’s many remixes, Paul Oakenfold’s version of Even Better Than the Real Thing was the most famous, but then his source material was fantastic: a rattlingly exciting song about the desire for immediate gratification – “Slide down the surface of things” – that now seems remarkably prescient. A commercial disappointment – selling a mere 5m copies – the album No Line on the Horizon was muddled and, in Larry Mullen’s words, “fucking miserable”. Finding its highlights requires a degree of sifting, but its title track is fantastic: a wracked vocal over a pulsing wall of guitar effects, the intensity of which ebbs and flows throughout the song. Trailed as a return to basics after the failed experiment of Pop, All That You Can’t Leave Behind wasn’t quite as straightforward as that, but U2 songs come no more direct and powerful than its lead single. Everything about Beautiful Day clicks perfectly, the apparent effortlessness of its widescreen euphoria at odds with its tricky gestation. By now, U2 could knock out potent stadium rock to order, as evidenced by Pride, but The Unforgettable Fire’s best moments are more opaque, less direct. The title track is atmospheric, synth-heavy and dense with serpentine melodies, its euphoric power gradually building over the course of five minutes. The gospel inflections and earnest tone of I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For are precisely the kind of thing that winds up U2’s detractors. But blessed with a melody that sounds it has somehow always existed, its strength lies in the fact that it doesn’t deal in pious sermonising; its expressions of spiritual doubt are disarmingly heartfelt. Of all Rattle And Hum’s attempts to tap into American music history, employing former Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks for All I Want Is You was the most inspired. His complex but beautiful string arrangement turns a straightforward love song into something richer, adding an undercurrent of uncertainty to Bono’s vocal proclamations. A lot has been written about Sunday Bloody Sunday’s lyrics – a non-sectarian, pacifist view of the Troubles – but its power lies in the way its sound keeps lurching back and forth from a clattering racket strafed with feedback and scraping violin to something more straightforward and palatable: a killer riff coupled with the singalong-inducing refrain: “How long must we sing this song?” Daringly at odds with then-prevalent trends for pumped-up and musclebound stadium rock, With Or Without You’s examination of faith and/or love is simple to the point of sounding stark: subtle, even subdued, never reaching the big climax you expect. None of which stopped it going to No 1 in the US, a very counterintuitive way of becoming the biggest band in the world. “Heavy-bottomed but light-headed” in the words of the producer Brian Eno, Mysterious Ways is one of a number of Achtung Baby tracks to bear the influence of contemporary indie-dance, an inspiration U2 were able to assimilate remarkably well, hence this gleefully lubricious blast of wah-wah guitar, congas and funky bass. Achtung Baby is rightly heralded as one of the great 180-degree artistic turns a major band has ever performed, but at its heart lies a traditionally U2-esque song: a love ballad that reaches for bigger topics – “We’re one, but we’re not the same, we get to carry each other” – so emotionally powerful it apparently reduced Axl Rose, of all people, to floods of tears. Where the Streets Have No Name had inauspicious beginnings: in effect written to order – The Joshua Tree was “short [of] a certain kind of song”, the Edge later recalled – the band struggled to record it, and Eno was so unimpressed he attempted to wipe the tape. He would have erased a song that perfectly sums up U2’s appeal. Powered by a particularly gripping example of Edge’s patent echo-drenched arpeggios, it is breathlessly exciting without ever resorting to rock anthem cliche (the time signature changes twice). The lyrics seem to be as much about the ability of music to inspire joyful transcendence as the divisions in Belfast that inspired them and the chorus soars irresistibly. “The ultimate U2 live song,” Edge suggested. He was right.",culture
"At 2.30pm Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre and Maria Balshaw, director of Tate art museums and galleries, convene on screen – the new abnormal – for a conversation about the Covid-19 crisis and how they plan to help their institutions survive it. Norris is first to admit our get-together is not ideal as his blurred silhouette appears: “I’m at home, in the bedroom, because it’s the best internet spot. If things get really bad, I’ll have to speak to you on the phone.” Balshaw, at home in Kent, is similarly quick to identify the idiosyncrasies in her new working life: “I’ve got my museum director husband [Nick Merriman, chief executive of Horniman Museum] with me – we rotate in and out of this room.” Erratic bandwidth is the least of the problems Norris and Balshaw face. Before lockdown, there was a £110bn creative industries sector, the fastest-growing in the UK. Now, the challenge is to keep cultural institutions out of intensive care. For although Arts Council England has launched a £160m emergency package across the cultural sector, the longer our museums and theatres remain closed, the more perilous their future becomes. But beyond the immediate question of when the Tate and National might reopen, this is, more positively, a moment of potential change: there are questions of how cultural appetites are altering as art in lockdown becomes more democratic. And questions about whether the Covid-19 crisis will make a good subject for theatre. What sort of art might develop post-lockdown? But before looking ahead, it is necessary to look back – not least because of the way time seems to be behaving in our new world (moving so fast in one sense, so slowly in another). I begin by asking Norris and Balshaw to remember how they felt as they locked down their institutions. Did they have any idea what was to come? Rufus Norris: It was very odd because we were told in the most blunt, ill-considered way that people were not to go to theatres before we were given any warning or told to shut. Boris’s announcement came just before a meeting with the cast of The Visit. We decided mutually the actors could not go on. Afterwards, I walked into the Olivier at 7.30 – the show should already have been running – and sat in the empty theatre. I remember thinking: how long will it be before I’m back in this theatre again? My overriding thought was about safety. This had all come up very quickly. I felt a bit naive, felt that collectively perhaps we should not have relied on government and made our own call earlier. Maria Balshaw: Like Rufus, looking back, I wonder why I didn’t realise sooner that what happened needed to happen. The truth is we were all living in real time and society as a whole didn’t realise. I remember the acute strangeness of opening the Andy Warhol show at Tate Modern on 10 March. Our donors did not want to be there – already worried about the virus. The president of the Andy Warhol Foundation had flown over from New York and was saying: “Everyone thinks I’m crazy but I wanted to be here and witness this.” The opening felt incredibly celebratory yet presaging of disaster to come. How have your feelings changed over the ensuing weeks?RN: It’s been so fast-moving. The problem with closing down an organisation on the scale of the National is it takes a huge amount of effort, furloughing – nobody even knew how to spell that word a few weeks ago – and emergency planning. It’s like scrabbling in a swimming pool, trying to find the steps. When you don’t know what’s going on for a long period, it’s incredibly wearing. As the leader of an organisation, you’re not doing the job unless you look at the worst so you can start trying to plan ahead. MB: At the beginning, it was shocking but people thought the crisis would last three weeks. Possibly six. Now we’re at a moment where we have to think about more than the recovery of individual institutions and our sectors. We’ve got to start thinking: how do we shape the world for the new normal? The pressures we’re under – financial, practical and emotional – mean we’ll not be the same on the other side. When do you expect to open?RN: That’s the million-dollar question. Maria and I are in different sectors from that point of view – our business is about bringing large groups of people together. About 60 to 70% of the National’s income comes from people visiting and buying tickets. We’re very supportive of the government’s policy on social distancing. But the reality, in blunt terms, is that if we have two metres social distancing we can only sell one ticket in six or seven – which is not viable. Teatro Franco Parenti in Milan is reducing seating from 500 to 65…RN: With the levels of subsidy in some European houses, that might be worth it but it’s out of the question for a commercial theatre. Cameron Mackintosh says theatres are unlikely to reopen until 2021 – is this unduly pessimistic?RN: He’s possibly right: he’s talking about his theatres getting back to a place where audiences are comfortable to come back in large numbers. That’s going to require audience confidence which may only return when there’s a vaccine. Until social distancing can be relaxed, it’s hard to imagine getting back to a place where we can become viable. In terms of the timetable, we’ve plans for September. We’ve plans for January. I’m making plans for April 2021. But I have to say the January and the April 2021 plans would involve us going insolvent. Without additional government support 70% of theatres will be boarded by Christmas. When will the NT’s money run out?RN: It depends on furloughing. If it keeps going, it won’t cover all our costs but will give us longer. Our turnover is £100m a year. In full swing, it costs two million a week to keep the place going. Some money comes from the Arts Council but we’re losing several million a month. MB: Like the National, we have reserves but even an organisation as large as Tate will face massive challenges. Rufus will be cross with me if I’m not frank about that. We’ll face a huge challenge if we have an extended period with very few visitors. The reopening of the Tate’s galleries won’t be immediate. Museums fall into the third phase of easing of restrictions which means London museums might open late July through to September, probably a few at a time. What plans are you putting into place?MB: All my colleagues are working at fever pitch to see how we can make museums open yet socially distant. How should we deal with hygiene and safety issues? How do we think about the numbers of people coming to us? In London, one of the biggest issues is going to be public transport. We don’t want it overwhelmed. We’ll be advocating that people who live locally walk to our institutions. I walk to work on good days – a fantastic thing to do in London. Will Tate have to start charging for entry?MB: We’ve done a remarkable amount through lockdown to reach new audiences. I want us to be there for the whole British public even if we have to welcome people in smaller numbers. I wouldn’t want to put a barrier in the way of anyone coming. Free entry is more important than ever. RN: We’re also looking into everything. We’ve a whole team working on creative ideas about social distancing. Can you get people masks? Can you build extra toilets? Can you only pre-order drinks? Can you put plastic screens between people on seats? What happens if you just do every other seat? We’ve cut production budgets in half. We’ve had wage cuts that our brilliant staff have had to take and it’s much worse for freelancers – they’re in a desperate position. The playwright James Graham suggests an “aggressive government bailout” is needed…RN: “Aggressive government bailout” feels blunt but we’ll need government support. The Arts Council does not expect us to fulfil our duties during lockdown – it’s not as if we have zero money coming in. MB: We too have a grant in aid but, like the National, Tate earns 70% of its income through visitors. People coming back is what we need. I agree with Rufus the job retention scheme has been a godsend but we’ll also need further financial backing from the government. And any challenge for the Tate will be even more threatening for smaller institutions. This is going to be a period of the most acute challenge the arts ecology has ever faced. And will smaller theatres survive?RN: Without support – no. If this goes on much longer, it’s very hard to imagine any theatre surviving. Whatever it means for the National, you can multiply several times for regional theatres. A lot of our work now is about advocacy to make sure the government, under huge pressure as it is, understands what our sector contributes and how urgent it is that a nuanced, informed view of helping us survive is taken on by them. How worried are you by surveys reporting that many people are frightened by the relaxation of lockdown? Does your role include a need to reassure the public?MB: Our world has changed beyond recognition. It’s understandable people feel fearful. Museums, galleries and the arts have a huge role to play in rebuilding social confidence. People may have to come differently – book a time slot, come in one way, leave another way. We’ll need to reassure the public the numbers will not put them at risk. And this is urgent because of another challenge our country now faces: people’s emotional wellbeing, social connections and mental health. RN: The worst thing would be if we opened too early because of financial need. If we rushed back and audiences came to our spaces and we hadn’t looked after them properly and they got sick – that must not be allowed to happen. It would be a disaster if we opened up and had to close down again. Reassurance will only be possible when the time is right. I gather you’ve been ill with the virus yourself, Rufus?RN: I was very ill for a couple of weeks but thankful it didn’t take me to hospital. I know a lot of people who have been very ill. Has this period made you reflect on what your jobs are for now that getting bums on seats/people through doors is out of the equation?MB: We’re dealing with large-scale disaster management yet, in a more profound way, this crisis reminds us why human beings need art. You can see the hunger for it and people’s desire to create themselves. The silver lining of what we’re going through is that people have been given time back and are using it to make paintings, throw pots, watch theatre, dance and sing. RN: Or they’re also going back to their photographs or getting creative in the kitchen or garden – the surge of creativity is really encouraging. There’ll be a generation, won’t there? The lockdown generation – who really got on with stuff while they had the space. MB: I was particularly moved by the singing on balconies in Italy. It’s people saying: I’ll not be silent in the face of fear. It gets to the heart of why we make art. And then there was Sacha Lord’s livestream Hacienda-style Manchester club night that went on the whole night, attracted millions and raised funds for that bit of the creative sector. What a brilliant idea – people raving in their own homes! That’s an image I want to hold on to…. Meanwhile NT at Home is hugely popular and has received more than £100,000 in donations…RN: It’s had 8 million views in the last five weeks. We weren’t expecting the donations but are now able to pay the actors. We’re introducing a broader range of titles. Our initial thinking was: people are going through a tough time, so what do they want? They want a comedy, so One Man, Two Guvnors… Sometimes, theatre can be a way of saying: “Just relax…” Will there be a new appetite for live art post-lockdown?MB: Just as people need to be back out in the world, they need to be seeing and thinking about art – it’s not a luxury. People have discovered so many new things digitally. It’s the hook that’s going to give them confidence to step out of their front doors again. I’ve made some wonderful discoveries during lockdown such as the live stream of Broken Wings by ENB – a ballet about Frida Kahlo. RN: I’ve found a variety of things – I especially enjoyed The Fireman’s Ball by Miloš Forman. I watched it with my partner and our two sons – a simple film, a satire. It appealed to our particular, weird, family taste. It’s hilarious. We have, obviously, been spending a lot more time together as a family – the one unadulterated, wonderful upside of lockdown. Are you in touch with colleagues in Europe and the US?MB: We’re actively in conversation in Europe, North America and beyond – we’re having Zoom meetings with colleagues in Italy and China because they’re at a different phase – there’s a huge amount to learn from them. We’re having brilliant creative conversations about how to reschedule touring exhibitions, make sure nobody loses out and let things happen over a longer time frame. RN: David Lan [playwright and director] recently organised a call with European, American and British artistic directors. In normal times, theatre can be a competitive environment but we all believe in what this sector brings to society and we’re working together. Will lockdown/coronavirus make a good subject for art/theatre?RN: Yes – although it is difficult when you’re in the middle of something to understand what impact it will have. But new writing is sure to emerge… If we reopen in September, what will people want to watch? They’re going to be nervous. We’ll have to give them a good reason to come and make it a real event… MB: Early in lockdown, one of my staff – an artist – sent a lovely message saying: “The artists among us have been practising lockdown for some time.” Unlike theatre-makers, artists depend on time apart. But it is possible lockdown might make artists focus in a new way. The deep emotional issues raised by this virus will infiltrate their minds as they have ours. What specifically are the emotional issues?MB: We’ve been going through a period of collective mourning because we took everyday social contact for granted – that sense of ourselves as human beings as part of a larger social whole. That’s been fundamentally challenged. We operated societally and individually as though we could overcome anything. We could fix things, cure things or pay to get ourselves out of difficult situations. None of those options has been open to us. Living with a sense of uncertainty is what people have been having to get used to. You can see they’re desperate for resolution: please tell us the answers. The truth is we don’t know how we are going to recover. Yet once we know we can reopen, I think we’ll definitely be ready. RN: Having been starved of live art, it’ll be like coming back to food you have been denied, there’ll be a great appetite for it. The crucial thing is to make sure we are there for audiences when that happens.

"Charlotte Higgins’ excellent article on the need to support the arts when the pandemic is over (After the war, the arts came back stronger. They can do so again now, 18 May) does contain one rather odd sentence near the end: “the war was the last time cultural organisations ground entirely to a halt”. Today we are unable to go to theatres or cinemas. During the war, the cinema was the staple entertainment (including the marvellous Pathé News), as was the theatre. It was the proud boast of the Windmill Theatre that, even during the blitz, “we never closed”. Perhaps the Windmill Theatre was not exactly a cultural organisation, though. I wouldn’t know: I used to wonder at the time exactly what it was. But the New Theatre and Playhouse in Oxford, where we were lucky enough to have no bombs, introduced me and many others to a lifelong love of the theatre.",culture
"Art galleries and museums in NSW are scrambling to prepare for visitors again after being somewhat taken by surprise by Gladys Berejiklian’s announcement that they could reopen from 1 June.  The announcement, which came alongside an opening up of travel restrictions across the state, came sooner than expected for the gallery and museum sector, which on Tuesday was still waiting for the NSW government to provide clear protocols on how institutions could operate with social distancing.  Visitor numbers will be capped according to the 4msq-per-person rule. Movement through spaces will need to be tightly managed to prevent people pooling around exhibits. Group tours will not be permitted, and gallery and museum eateries will have to observe the same social distancing regulations that apply to cafes and restaurants outside. More detail was expected in the next 24 hours. Liz Ann Macgregor, director of Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art, received word of the premier’s announcement only a few hours before it was made. “It’s been pretty … interesting,” she said. “We knew there were discussions going on in government and so it wasn’t totally unexpected. The surprise was the timeframe and what we have to do to get there. “Will we be opening on June 1 or sometime after June 1? To be honest, I actually don’t know right now. My guess is that it’s unlikely we’ll be able to open before mid-June.” The MCA had already implemented social distancing protocols before its closure in March. MCA capacity will be limited to 500 people across all floors and spaces. “At least we’ve had a rehearsal of a sort, we have plans ready to roll,” Macgregor said, but she was reluctant to adopt pre-booking of viewing slots. “For us, it’s not the technology required, it’s the philosophy,” she said. “We’ve always operated on the idea that the doors are open anytime. We want office workers to pop in during their lunch break. But if the government instructs us to do timed tickets, then of course we will.” In the north of the state, the Lismore Regional Gallery is planning to reopen on 1 June with an exhibition devoted to the work of Queensland-based artist Ross Manning. However, if the Queensland border remains closed, Manning won’t be able to attend his own opening night. “We got the double whammy of regional tourism opening up and being able to reopen the gallery,” director Brett Adlington said. “But we are really waiting for the border to reopen so we can get the day-trippers from south-east Queensland. At least we are only 30 minutes from Byron Bay, so we’re hoping to attract people who are coming to the area to visit family they haven’t seen for weeks.” There is a lot of work to be done before then. Many regional galleries rely on volunteers, most of whom are older and may be vulnerable, Adlington said. “They are keen to come back because they love it. But we need to keep them safe. We will have Perspex sneeze guards at the front desks and we will remove all the floor sheets and brochures that people pick up to read about the artists and take home.” The art-making area for children will also have to go. “It would be impossible to keep that clean,” Adlington said. Some of Sydney’s big institutions are closed for renovation or relocation. MAAS/Powerhouse is unlikely to reopen at its current Pyrmont site. The Australian Museum is closed until November. Carriageworks recently went into voluntary administration. The National Maritime Museum plans to open from 15 June. Sydney Living Museums, including Hyde Park Barracks and Museum of Sydney, is still finalising reopening plans. In Western Sydney, the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre and Campbelltown Arts Centre are both ready to open from 1 June. The Art Gallery of New South Wales will also open on that date, its director, Michael Brand, said. The 22nd Biennale of Sydney: Nirin and the exhibitions Shadow Catchers and Under the Stars (which opened briefly before the gallery closed on 23 March) will reopen alongside a new exhibition, Some Mysterious Process, which Brand has curated during the shutdown. “The main goal is to make our visitors feel like they’re coming home,” Brand said. “It will be a little different. There will be timed ticketing to control the numbers of people in the building and we’re still working out the social distancing required – and there won’t be any cloaking. But the beauty of an art museum is that visitors tend to wander around the space and you can take multiple paths and directions. If you see three people standing in front of a painting, you can come back to that one. There is already some self-policing.” Esther Anatolitis, executive director of National Association for the Visual Arts, said it was exciting to imagine spaces reopening, but there was a lot of work to be done.  “Not every gallery has the capability to implement timed ticketing – but more importantly, that’s quite a significant shift away from the welcoming, inclusive spaces that galleries offer. “Visual art, craft and design spaces are freely open to everybody – there are no barriers. There needs to be good risk management in place, but for months now everybody’s been able to walk into a supermarket and touch anything they like without leaving their name at the door. So we need to be able to respond to public demand while applying safe practices that are consistent across industries.”",culture

"James Keast, who has died aged 63 of cancer, was one of British television’s most revered costume designers, who brought colour and style to period dramas, from The House of Eliott and Mr Selfridge to Victoria and Belgravia, but whose flair, imagination and technical skills were also used to great effect in contemporary series. For Luther (2010-19), he gave Idris Elba’s obsessive detective a distinctive coat and tie. “Putting Idris into a suit just makes him look like James Bond,” explained Keast. “I needed to find something that would show Idris’s shape, without making him look like a male model, hence the long coat.” Inspired by the Ukrainian photographer Boris Mikhailov, whose photographs are often monotone with a striking splash of primary colour, Keast added a red tie. “Without the tie, he’d almost blend into his gloomy surroundings.” For Peter Flannery’s epic nine-part drama Our Friends in the North (1996), Keast followed fashion from the 1960s right up to date in the story of four Newcastle friends’ lives and the politics and policing throughout that period. In Mr Selfridge (2013-16), a period drama set in the first two decades of the 20th century, he dressed Jeremy Piven, playing the department store entrepreneur, in the formal style of the time but added waistcoats and neckties to suggest his “showman” style. Meanwhile, Keast developed the look of Harry Selfridge’s lover, the showgirl-turned-serious actor Ellen Love (Zoe Tapper), from down-at-heel – with her clothes looking second-hand – to wealthier as she becomes the face of the London store. Other characters’ costumes conveyed their class differences, the affluent adorned in silks and satins, with detail such as lace flowers and beading, and shop assistants in wools, cottons and linen. Keast’s final project was this year’s series of Belgravia, written by Julian Fellowes, following his success with Downton Abbey. It stepped back to the very distinctive fashions of the early 19th century. “We start in 1815 and, as we go through the 20s and 30s, the waistline drops and the skirts get bigger,” explained Keast, who also added corsets and up to four heavy petticoats under each skirt. Tamsin Greig, as the middle-class matriarch Anne Trenchard, spoke of how each of Keast’s “incredible costumes told their own individual story” about the person and the place they found themselves in. Photography books and catalogues of paintings in art exhibitions were often part of his research – he recalled visits to the theatre as a child being like “looking at a live painting”. Then he made, hired or bought costumes, sometimes from vintage shops, though always aware of budgetary constraints. When he worked on the first three episodes of Victoria in 2016, his first challenge was to duplicate the coronation cloak to be worn by Jenna Coleman in her role as the new monarch. “If I’d had to have that embroidered, it would have cost me about £20,000,” said Keast, “so I found somebody that would photograph and laser-print the images on the fabric. Then, I found another person that could, with a machine, embroider over the top of the laser-printed images to give a bit of 3D.” Keast’s love for the screen was ignited by watching late-night horror movies on TV as a child. He was born in Armadale, West Lothian, to Eileen (nee McGuinness) and Joseph Keast, a civil servant, and attended St Mary’s academy, Bathgate. His ambition to be a painter led him to Edinburgh School of Art, but his interest turned to costume design and after graduating he joined the costumiers Berman’s and Nathan’s, in London, making and fitting garments as a costume assistant on films such as Death on the Nile (1978), Clash of the Titans (1981) and Victor Victoria (1982). Then he joined the BBC on a trainee scheme, first working as a costume designer on the 1987 series of Bergerac. He followed this with the BBC film Truly, Madly, Deeply (1990) and the second run of the 1920s dressmaking saga The House of Eliott, in 1992. Keast’s first success after turning freelance came with the writer Jimmy McGovern’s bitingly topical ITV drama-documentary Hillsborough (1996), about the football stadium disaster. The range of his work in television was demonstrated by his ability to hop between different eras. From 18th- and 19th-century costume dramas such as Aristocrats (1999), about the Duke of Richmond’s four daughters, he went to adaptations of early-20th-century novels, including Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World (2001) and John Buchan’s The 39 Steps (2008), and on to two biopics about recent television history, The Curse of Steptoe (2008), reflecting on a classic sitcom, and Hughie Green, Most Sincerely (2008), about the philandering quiz-show host. Keast won best costume design awards from Bafta for the gangland drama The Long Firm (2004) and the Royal Television Society for the director Peter Kosminsky’s TV film Warriors (1999), about UN peacekeepers struggling to return to civilian life in the 1990s after seeing the horrors of ethnic cleansing. Desperate Romantics (2009), a tale of the 19th-century Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood artists, was among five other productions to earn him Bafta nominations. He was put to the test in an unexpected way when, during the filming of Tess of the d’Urbervilles (2009) for the BBC, a fire destroyed the principal costume truck, containing 750 garments worth £320,000 and his own prized collection of period jewellery, including cufflinks that had belonged to Laurence Olivier. He sourced new fabric and had costumes re-made within 24 hours. Keast is survived by Rodney Gibson, his partner of 37 years, and his seven brothers and three sisters.",culture
"At primary school, I had an incredible time learning incredibly little. Lessons were wild, teachers were sport and I made friends who have lasted me until middle age. For most of my life, I’ve considered these not only memories but principles: more than anything, children need to be happy, and there’s plenty of time for serious stuff later on. But then my daughter went into reception and – amazingly – I began to swither, theorising that she is not me, so her circumstances are different from mine. And then coronavirus appointed me headmaster of Harris homeschool and – amazingly – I became absolutely certain, announcing that things needed achieving. Following discussion with the chairman of the governors, formerly known as my wife, non-essential subjects were quickly binned to focus on skills, rather than information, alongside a bespoke programme of enrichment studies, ie, liking the stuff we like. Meanwhile, I furnished myself with a new suite of parental neuroses: how do I bestow the benefit of a one-on-one education from someone existentially invested in the outcome, while maintaining a father-daughter dynamic, while assuming a new role of best friend, while ensuring demarcation between home and school, while not being an overbearing moron at a time of intense stress such as to cause permanent psychological damage? This is a rhetorical question, not because everyone knows the answer but because there is no answer. All of which is a long-winded way of saying that what I’m really watching is not a lot. By the end of each day I’m so drained and occasionally elated that I offer even less resistance than usual to my boss’s Real Housewives imposition, every minute of which was justified the moment Porsha congratulated Eva for the “social distancing” performed by her “titties”. In the end we opted to omit that from the curriculum, but as part of tutoring my daughter in the ways of righteousness I decided that we should watch Dark Towers – made in 1981 as part of the BBC’s Look and Read series. If you went to school in the UK, you’ll likely be familiar with the genre: a story is told over the course of a few weeks, around which language and grammar are taught by presenters in outfits running the full spectrum of beige to brown, and who look 64 but are in fact 23. If Dark Towers was one of yours, you’ll definitely remember its magnificent theme tune and almost definitely remember an accordant nightmare epidemic – which stopped our class watching the final few episodes. Though I wasn’t one of those who let on, I’d be lying if I made out I was revisiting some childhood happy place. But Dark Towers was was one of the first stories to incite in me a visceral reaction, and if parenting is about preparing kids for the world, then squashing anxiety and maintaining perspective are handy things for them to know. I wondered whether the experience would be diluted by watching on a normal telly rather than a tardis on stilts that required a physics degree to operate. But the show shifted medium seamlessly, and its epic, sprawling, soaring introduction remains just brilliant as I remembered – though now I’m desperate for a Tenaglia remix. I must confess, though, that I’d half-forgotten about Wordy, an orange floating-head droid with letter zits. He and the presenter – clad in head-to-toe ginger, a phenomenal turn-up for the books – use the library they’re in, along with a collection of songs from the legendary Geordie Racer, to inculcate a love of words, wordplay, books and expression. I conceal my smirk when the “Magic E” ditty comes on, but the purity of it all is actually quite moving. But centrepiece of the show is the story – written by Andrew Davies who, though he never again scaled such lofty heights, went on to enjoy a fairly decent career. And what an opening he delivers here! “Tracy was a loner,” a voiceover intones. “She thought boys were daft … and she thought girls were daft!” Where to go after that? Well, “I like books better than people” – offered by Lord Edward Dark, the young heir to the eponymous edifice – isn’t a bad effort, and his relationship with Tracy offers a classic oddballs-make-friends subplot. But the principal narrative follows their bid to save the crumbling towers from the various crooks – one played by a youthful Christopher Biggins – who are after its treasure. To this end, they are helped by various supernatural happenings: “Would you be scared if you saw a ghost?” asks the voiceover in episode four, sweeping up any kids still unpetrified.  On this basis, my daughter eventually decided that Dark Towers wasn’t for her. I deployed my usual it’s only a story shtick, as well as reminding her to face fear and persevere. But she would have none of it and, as the plot progressed, I began to re-evaluate my own advice. “Girls were not like you in my day”, the friendly ghost tells Tracy condescendingly; “You read far too many books,” Edward’s dad chides him; “I don’t trust anyone,” Bunce surmises. Which is to say that the switched on, pleasant characters are kids and the ignorant, stubborn, mendacious fuckwits are adults. It’s a weird thing, being an adult, and an even weirder thing being a parent. You assume authority for shaping another person, then through example and indoctrination encourage them to be like you when sometimes even you don’t want to be like you. The pressure is awesome, the love overwhelming and the scope for error daunting. Whatever goes right feels like nature and whatever goes wrong feels like nurture. All of this is exacerbated by lockdown, the claustrophobic sameness magnifying feelings and multiplying flashpoints, with each day raising new versions of the same essential quandaries: take joy wherever you find it … but 17 biscuits and eight telly hours might be excessive. Unusual times provoke unusual behaviours … but new bad habits mustn’t ingrain; leniency is key at such a difficult time … but WHY YOU LITTLE! It’s a lot. So, though I started Dark Towers to close a door from my own childhood, it resonated with me because of the one currently in progress, for which I am responsible. Watching it, I was reassured that sometimes kids know what’s best for them, and the joy of seeing them think, emote and express is a strong one – even when you’d prefer them to just do what you say. What my daughter needs is not necessarily what I needed, and the one thing of which I can be sure is that the world does not require another me. Only Bond villains seek to clone themselves. Very clearly, the parents in Dark Towers are failing at their principal job – raising happy children – which, in a pandemic, is a parent’s only job. If you teach them stuff, that’s great, but if you teach them to love being alive, that’s enough.",culture
"Progress made in the representation and inclusion of disabled artists and audiences is in danger of unravelling because of the pandemic, campaigners have warned. A new alliance of disabled people and groups working in the UK’s cultural industries, #WeShallNotBeRemoved, has been established to make sure disabled voices are heard as the nation’s devastated arts sector attempts to rebuild after the lockdown. Jenny Sealey, the artistic director of Graeae theatre in east London, said the pandemic had exposed real inequalities in theatre “by the million and one Zooms set up within our industry and the noticeable lack of deaf and disabled voices and black, Asian and ethnically diverse people in the mix”. She added: “As our community will be the last to come out of lockdown, the fear is by then we will be forgotten as artists and audience.” Campaigners say the lockdown has magnified inequalities for disabled people in the creative industries, with many disabled artists facing long-term shielding, loss of income and invisibility in wider society. The lockdown came when many were beginning to feel real change had finally arrived. Andrew Miller, the government’s first disability champion for arts and culture, pointed to the casting of Amy Trigg, who uses a wheelchair, in RSC productions and the then imminent opening at the National Theatre of Francesca Martinez’s play All of Us, which explores being disabled during a time of austerity. “There was a real sense of ‘hey, we’re going somewhere … we’re finally being included’. There was a real sense of progress. It wasn’t perfect. There was a a lot still to do. But there was a sense disabled people were becoming part of the fabric of arts and culture.” Sealey said the progress had been “frustrating and unnecessarily slow … It has taken the best part of 40 years for deaf and disabled people to be seen as a force to be reckoned with.” Then lockdown happened and prompted genuine concern that progress might unravel. Sealey said the drive to reopen theatres was “extremely ableist and non-diverse” in its approach. She added: “I am seriously concerned that we will be deemed too expensive, with companies no longer being able to cover the cost of access and that our work is too risqué and the theatre world wants post-pandemic nice, safe theatre.” Campaigners on Wednesday staged a social media action day, flooding Twitter, Facebook and Instagram with disabled voices. It included artists sharing their work online. The musician and campaigner John Kelly said: “We want to demonstrate solidarity and support for disabled people who are facing a very challenging future because of the pandemic by sharing the rich tapestry of our artworks to raise our voice, of our talent and our resilience.” Miller hopes arts leaders will seize on the opportunities offered by having to rebuild an entire industry. “It is a real opportunity to reset the longstanding discriminatory access issues in arts and culture,” he said.",culture
"Despite Trump’s declaration Monday that the US has “prevailed” over coronavirus, infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned Congress in a televised hearing on Tuesday that reopening the country too soon would lead to “needless suffering and death”, which “I think is Trump’s new campaign slogan,” said Jimmy Kimmel. “Fauci and Trump seem to have opposite views of how to handle this – Trump says ‘we have prevailed!’ on the same day everyone at the White House was required to wear a mask,” he added. “So I guess it just comes down to who you believe: the doctor who’s one of the world’s leading experts on infectious disease, or our personal pan-president.” To convey the stakes of reopening the country too soon – which, Fauci warned, could also hamper economic recovery – Kimmel used the metaphor of a scab, “a big, black scab on our nation’s face. It’s not pretty; in fact, it’s ugly. It’s doing an important job – it’s healing and containing the wound. The best thing you can do with a scab is be patient and let it fall off. Unfortunately, there are some impatient people who want to dig their tiny orange fingernails into the scab and rip it off early and eat it. “And while that would feel good for like a second, if you rip off the scab and the wound is still bleeding under there, you have to start all over again with a new scab,” Kimmel said. “So what Dr Fauci is saying is the same thing your mother said: don’t pick the scab.” Meanwhile, leadership at Fox News, “the little engine behind the back to work movement”, according to Kimmel, decided to keep their New York offices closed through at least 15 June. “Isn’t that something? Fox News, the ones who are making fun of people cowering at home, is advising its employees to stay home,” said Kimmel. “Because apparently, they don’t get their news from Fox News.” Finally, Kimmel touched on Trump’s new distraction technique of “Obamagate”, a vague, made-up scandal he has propagated since Yahoo News leaked remarks by the former president criticizing Trump’s response to the coronavirus as a chaotic disaster. In an interview with Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, called Obama’s critique of the administration “classless”. “Wait … Obama is classless?” exclaimed Kimmel. “He’s joking – of all the wildly hypocritical things anyone has ever said about anything during this ordeal, the idea that Obama is classless and shouldn’t say bad things about another president – that might take the cake.” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also addressed Trump’s made-up “Obamagate” conspiracy theory – or, at least, tried to discern what it’s supposed to be about. On Monday, when asked to explain by a reporter, Trump responded: “You know what the crime is, the crime is very obvious to everybody, all you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.” “OK, that’s just weird – according to Trump, Obama committed the worst political crime in American history,” Noah said, quoting Trump’s words on Twitter, “but Trump won’t tell us what the crime is. Because it’s so obvious that you don’t even need to ask … even though everyone needs to ask. “Trump is treating Obama less like a criminal and more like they’re in a relationship and Trump feels like Obama messed up,” Noah added, breaking out his Trump impersonation: “If you don’t know what you did wrong, well I’m not going to tell you.” “So we have no idea what Obamagate actually is supposed to be,” Noah concluded. “And I don’t think Trump actually knows either. In fact, I think the only lesson Trump learned from Watergate is that things he doesn’t like should have the word “-gate” after it – Obama-gate, salad-gate, Eric-gate.” “Listening to health experts testify today, you might feel like we’ve got a long battle ahead of us,” said Stephen Colbert of Fauci’s virtual testimony before the Senate on Tuesday, “but according to the president, we’ve already won.” On Monday, Trump said in a White House briefing that America has “met the moment and we have prevailed” despite rising coronavirus cases across the country and Fauci’s warning that opening the US too soon would lead to “needless suffering and death”. “Look, I think our country is gonna pull through this, but that seems a little premature,” said Colbert of Trump’s proclamation. “It’s like passing out cigars on your first date, yelling: ‘it’s a boy!’” Trump, pressed by a reporter, clarified that he meant America has “prevailed on testing”. “Oh, we’re prevailing on something we needed to do months ago,” Colbert deadpanned. “I think his propaganda banner might need a slight change: ‘America leads the world in testing – but not for everyone, terms and conditions apply, side-effects may include no testing.”",culture
"Were she another kind of person, Jameela Jamil would have an easy life. Everything seemed to be going her way. First came the break that led to a job presenting Channel 4’s Saturday morning hangover slot, T4, which was followed by a job on Radio 1, before a swift, and unexpected, move to become an actor on the hit US sitcom The Good Place. Yet barely a month goes by without Jamil popping up to ignite some controversy or inflame the kind of commentator incensed by any hint of perceived “wokeness”. February was a particularly difficult month. First, she came out as queer, which appeared to infuriate many people. Then she had to defend herself against accusations she had Munchausen’s syndrome – a psychiatric disorder in which people feign illness – an allegation started by a writer who didn’t believe her history of health problems. She ended the month embroiled in a Twitter row with Piers Morgan (public feuds being something of a natural stomping ground for both) after the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack. Does Jamil ever feel like living a quieter life? “It’s not an easy path,” she says. “You get hurled up on to a pedestal and it always feels a bit like a trap – it’s very high, it’s easy to slip off and it’s a long way down. I’m just learning, I’m not the authority on anything.” She has not, she says, “handled myself perfectly at all times, but I am a human, prone to error”. We talk on the phone, with Jamil calling from her home in Los Angeles, which she shares with her boyfriend, the musician James Blake and three friends. The lockdown has not been too difficult, she says. “I couldn’t feel more privileged right now. I’m safe, I have a house. I can afford to not work for a while and I have my health,” she says. “On a more frivolous note, I’m really happy that handshaking is kind of cancelled for ever.” It has always appalled her, she says, and her explanation is something I have never considered before and will never be able to forget. “The fact you know that a hand has been on a dick at some point before touching your hand is deeply unsettling,” she says with a laugh, going on to describe it as “a sort of penile imprint upon your palm”. She has always succumbed to polite convention when someone puts their hand out. “Never again.” She is excited, too, about the possible return of women’s body hair, saying that “we’re coming out of this furrier, chubbier, spottier and hopefully alive. And that’s great – we are the lucky ones.” Might it mark the end of the ridiculous grooming ideals (the lip fillers, the weirdly immaculate eyebrows)? “For women who have transitioned, I think not having access to aestheticians is really difficult. But I think some women are becoming used to seeing their faces without makeup, and realising that you don’t need all of the nonsense that we have flogged at us.” Mostly she hopes that “our value systems are going to shift. Celebrities have been hero-worshipped, and now it has become very obvious who the true heroes are. And I think celebrities are consistently making arses of themselves.” I would be happy never to see a certain kind of influencer again, I say. “Who is going to have the money for cellulite cream, fillers or detox teas? No one’s going to want to see your $300 bikini any more. The way that we have looked up to money, fame and materialism …” She pauses. “I think that’s gone overnight because we don’t have the luxury any more. We’re talking about life or death. This is a depression. [Celebrities] need to shut up and open their purses.” (Jamil is donating to refugee and domestic violence charities.) She has a new podcast, which started at the beginning of the month, and she will soon launch a YouTube show. (“Is there anything sadder than a 34-year-old trying to start a YouTube channel?” she laughs.) Both come under her I Weigh movement, a campaign that started on Instagram in 2018 to promote the idea that people, especially women, should be “weighed” by their achievements rather than the number on their bathroom scales – and to promote inclusivity, social justice and mental health.  The latest episode of the podcast features Reese Witherspoon talking about postnatal depression and her experience of sexism in the entertainment industry. Future interviews will be with the writer Roxane Gay, Gloria Steinem and the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke. It is a sign of Jamil’s influence that she simply made a wishlist of people she wanted to interview, and they said yes. “I got creepy in the DMs [direct messages],” she says with a laugh. “I have absolutely no shame, and it’s great that the podcast is about ridding yourself of shame. This is also a podcast that is supposed to offer hope. We’re showing someone’s journey from the darkness towards the light.” If her guests seem to open up, it is probably because Jamil herself is incredibly candid. In the episode with Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general of the US and author of Together, a book about loneliness, Jamil talks about trying to kill herself at 26. In other episodes, she talks about the eating disorder she had as a teenager. It is almost easy to see why the conspiracy theory that she has Munchausen’s syndrome took off; she has been through so much, almost too much for one person. She attended an independent girls’ school in London (on a scholarship; she and her brother were mostly brought up by their mother, a school secretary) where she says she was the victim of racist bullying that was physical and violent. She was abused as a child, and was later the victim of several sexual assaults. She has said she is a multiple rape victim. At 17, she was hit by a car, severely damaging her spine, and spent more than a year recovering. Mental illness led to the attempt to kill herself in her mid-20s, at which point she sought therapy. She also went through several painful operations as a child to deal with hearing loss, and has coeliac disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects the body’s connective tissues. In revealing so much about herself, she – unwittingly or not – places herself at the centre of many experiences. She may say, not unreasonably, that being so open reduces stigma, but it can also look like attention-seeking and self-promotion. This appeared to be what prompted the backlash when Jamil came out as queer. She had been criticised on social media for her appointment as a judge on Legendary, a TV competition inspired by black LGBT ballroom and vogueing culture. To all appearances, Jamil was a heterosexual cis woman who had been in a relationship with a man for five years. Jamil is not interested in justifying herself or how she identifies. (“Staying away from that question,” she says good-naturedly when I bring it up.) But was she surprised by the reaction? “No, I understood, because of the timing. I was never trying to divert from [the criticism]. I was just trying to add to the conversation; that I’m not saying this qualifies me as a part of ballroom [culture], but you don’t actually know my sexuality.” She had not come out before “because I was worried that people would think I was jumping on a trendy bandwagon. And various other reasons. So I understand the pushback.” What she didn’t understand, she says, were the claims she was a liar. “What a weird lie,” she says with a laugh. “It doesn’t help to identify yourself in any way in an industry that still discriminates against people. But the rest of it, I understood. That’s why I didn’t come back complaining.” The same criticisms around appropriation have surrounded Jamil’s campaigning on body image when she herself is slim and conventionally beautiful. She has been accused of shaming other women – most damagingly black women, such as the rapper CupcakKe (after the entertainer announced she had been on a 40-day “water fast”) without acknowledging that the policing of black women’s bodies comes with its own painful history. There have also been accusations she has adopted the words and ideas of others, such as the writer Stephanie Yeboah. Her brand of feminism has been described as “exclusionary … and toxic” by the writer Danielle Dash. Jamil has always said she is constantly learning, and readily admits to her own mistakes and gaps in her knowledge. (In October, for instance, she explained she knew little about George W Bush’s presidency after being embroiled in another Twitter row.) Using her platform, particularly as one of the most high-profile women of south Asian heritage in the western media, puts her in a tricky position. Does she speak out about airbrushing and start feuds with the Kardashians over the diet products they promote – and risk making mistakes – or keep quiet? “I’ve asked repeatedly for magazines to put me on the cover with women of different body shapes, and with disabilities, and they say no. So either no one has the conversation or I do the photoshoot by myself because then at least the conversation gets had.” People have been impatient, she says; her YouTube show will provide a platform for other activists. “You have to take hold of the mic first before you can pass it,” she says. Jamil is so divisive, seemingly equally championed by those who like her openness and sense of humour (she is not an earnest sort of activist), and vilified by those who think she is endlessly virtue-signalling for her own gain. Blake sometimes steps in. (After the Munchausen’s rumour went viral, he posted: “It’s pretty disgusting to watch the woman I love just be dog piled on every day.”) Would she rather he didn’t? She laughs. “I don’t want it to impair his career in any way just because I’m in a controversy. But it must be difficult to see people hurt someone you love. I’m very lucky to have someone this diehard in my corner.” She says she is “absolutely fine” dealing with the fallout if she feels in the wrong. “It’s when it’s a lie, a smear campaign – that doesn’t sit well with me because that’s the technique of discredit. We make [women] sound crazy and unhinged, and we try to devalue their word and their work.” There must be days, I say, when it gets too much. “I’d say the Munchausen’s thing. The Caroline Flack thing really upset me because we were on good terms.” They had not really spoken “just because of what had been going on”, says Jamil (in October, Jamil had criticised a cosmetic surgery show Flack would be presenting). “She reached out to me with a message of such love, and she passed away that week.” The next week, Piers Morgan posted text messages from Flack on Twitter, sent to him last year saying she was “struggling” with Jamil, “as if I was any contribution to her passing, when I’d never instigated any kind of argument with Caroline. I don’t criticise the host, I criticise the show.” She says she didn’t publish Flack’s last message to her “because I’m not a scumbag”. Ultimately, she says, she will not shut up. Outspoken women, and especially outspoken women of colour, are disproportionately attacked online. “That isn’t just about the woman they are vilifying,” says Jamil. “It’s also a deliberate message they are sending out to all other women to not speak out, to not stand for something, to not break the rules. And that’s why I can’t back down now, because otherwise it would say that it wasn’t worth it and that I shouldn’t have stuck my neck out.” The car accident partly explains her resilience. “Having a near-death experience gives you a strong perspective,” she says. “Being dragged on Twitter or being embarrassed on television – or rejection – nothing scares me any more. So I think it made me very bold.” She was also inspired by Yes Man, the memoir by Danny Wallace in which he spent a year saying “yes”. It partly explains her decision to move to the US and dare to audition for The Good Place, having never acted before. “I am definitely more surprised [at my career] than any of you could ever be.” But it was her breakdown in her mid-20s that became the bigger pivotal moment. “After that, I realised it was very much do or die, and I had to investigate everything that had led me to such a low point,” she says. “One of those things was shame. You place the blame upon yourself, especially when you’re very young. But also just shame for being a woman. You’re too skinny, you’re too fat, you’re not smart enough or you’re too smart. I completely accept my own fuck-ups, but a lot of things that have caused a lot of trauma are not my fault.” That’s why she does what she does, she says – the social-media posts that sometimes strike the wrong note, the fights, the campaigns. “Important conversations feel uncomfortable. And therefore we leave young people unarmed.” She would like to work on syllabuses for schools “so that we don’t learn more about igneous rock than we learn about consent, eating disorders and the lies of social media”. What next for Jamil? She has built up a large social-media following and something of a power base. If it is to further her acting career, constantly criticising many aspects of the entertainment industry would be a funny way of going about it. So no nice, easy life for her. “I would do certain things differently,” she says. “I would rather start the fights that I start and sometimes get into the trouble that I get into than sit here silently and be complicit in an industry that pumps so much toxicity into the world.” She understands some people’s wariness of her, she says. “I look like the enemy. I’m a slim, privileged person who exists within this industry; I totally get the mistrust. I will just have to do the work to prove I wasn’t such a shitbag after all. I’m not doing this for popularity. I’m doing this so that I can undo the stuff that I saw when I was younger, that made me unwell, and try to change it.” There is a smile in her voice as she says: “And sometimes you have to be annoying and attention-seeking in order to instigate that change.”  Jameela Jamil’s I Weigh podcast is hosted at www.earwolf.com  In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

"We’re not the only ones in lockdown. While the pandemic continues, millions of objects in UK museums – a dizzying array of treasures and oddities – are shut away behind closed doors, visible only to staff. In last week’s Observer, to remind readers of some of the items gathering dust at London’s Victoria & Albert Museum, we asked its director Tristram Hunt to highlight 10 of his favourite artefacts from the collection (his choices included a Rodin bronze and Grayson Perry’s Brexit vases). This week we’ve gone countrywide, asking the directors of five museums outside London to each choose two favourite items that represent their institution or region.  “The reason that we exist is to care for the collections and make them accessible, so the fact that we’re not able to open the doors and let people see the collections is really heart-breaking,” says Kathryn Thomson, director of National Museums of Northern Ireland.Directors are rethinking their roles. “We are looking at different ways to tell stories,” says Caroline McDonald, manager of the Great North Museum, Hancock, in Newcastle.  Raven Transformation Mask by Haida chief and master carver Charles Edenshaw, 1880 This very striking object is considered to be one of the greatest works of art ever made by the Haida people of western Canada. Raven is an important being in Haida culture, a powerful and mischievous creative force who features in many stories and whose transformation is acted out in dances with the help of masks like this. The renowned Haida artist Gwaai Edenshaw was meant to come to Oxford this year to work with teenagers from local schools in a collaboration with the Oxford company Flintlock Theatre. Witch in a bottle, collected in Hove, Sussex in 1915 “Witch bottles” were seen as magical tools to protect against evil. This glass bottle was collected by a prominent female scholar in an otherwise male-dominated academy named Margaret Murray. It is said that the old lady it was obtained from warned: “They do say there be a witch in it, and if you let un out there’ll be a peck o’trouble”. At the beginning of the pandemic, we had people jokingly ask whether we had maybe let “un” out? We reassured everyone we had not. German armour, 1500-10 We have an amazing collection of arms and armour, including a very decorative suit belonging to the Earl of Pembroke, but this plainer suit of armour, which would have been worn by a mercenary soldier, affects me much more. The helmet reminds me of Robocop, rounded with very narrow eye slits. The design is quite simple but brutally effective. You see a guy coming at you with this on, and you’re going to turn and run. It makes you remember how horrible war has always been and always will be. Spitfire, 1946 Spitfires have an emotional connection for most British people – it’s seen as the plane that saved us in the Second World War – but this one was actually built after the war in 1946, for the City of Glasgow squadron. As a museum item, it comes with its practical challenges: it’s a four-ton object that we’ve got suspended from the ceiling, and every 10 years it has to come down for conservation work, which is a bit of a pain. But it’s a great thing to have. Endangered harlequin frog, Panama This is not an artefact as such: it’s alive and kicking. Harlequin frogs are from a remote indigenous rainforest community in Panama. They are beautiful and very small, not that much bigger than your thumbnail. The only place you can see them outside Panama, where they are on the brink of extinction, is in our vivarium. Manchu headdress (dian zi), China Dian zi translates as “hat ring”, an accessory worn by noble Manchu women at weddings, festivals and birthdays – all the things I wish I was attending now. This is a beautiful example from the 19th century, so richly decorated. It’s made of thin rattan strips woven into a check pattern and hung with gemstones, pearls, coral and enamel work. The extraordinary blue colour comes from inlaid kingfisher feathers, which when they catch the light are heartstoppingly beautiful. Derry Girls blackboard This is the much-celebrated “differences” blackboard from Channel 4’s Derry Girls, from the episode in season two where the girls go on a cross-community trip with a Protestant school. The episode created a huge amount of conversation and, though it’s dealing with difficult subject matter, people were able to have a laugh at it. You can take the Derry Girls test to find out how Catholic or Protestant you are. It’s light-hearted and playful, while also challenging stereotypes and showing that, really, we’re not all that different. Bomb disposal robot Prior to 1972, explosive devices could only be disarmed by hand. Then disposal experts started to use an instrument codenamed “Pigstick”, which shot a burst of water into the rigged explosive that caused the circuitry to malfunction. Then a retired lieutenant-colonel, Peter Miller, developed a robot that used a similar technique. From 1972 to 1978, 400 of these units were destroyed while dealing with explosive devices. This is part of our permanent exhibition, The Troubles and Beyond, at the Ulster Museum, and it’s a reflection of how far we’ve come as a society in Northern Ireland. Hadrian inscription This is really the Rosetta stone of the north – an incredibly important national object that perhaps gets overlooked because it has remained in the north. It’s an inscription from Hadrian’s Wall that was discovered near Milecastle 38 around 250 years ago, but it wasn’t until the mid-19th century that anyone understood its importance. There was a huge debate around who had built the wall, and this stone confirmed that it was Hadrian who kicked off this monumental building project. Struggle with the Quarry by John Hancock Taxidermy is often maligned, but this piece by the great local naturalist John Hancock – in whose honour our museum is named – is a fantastic work of art, made for the Great Exhibition of 1851. In the mid-Victorian era, there was a move away from the sense of nature as serene and pastoral. What Hancock is demonstrating in this piece, where a falcon fights a heron over an eel that’s slithering away, is that nature is vicious, cruel and hierarchical. It’s relevant now, because we see nature surging back.",culture
"The Sydney Opera House has been approached to consult on the long-term viability of multi-arts precinct Carriageworks as reports emerge that the Berejiklian government is considering a proposal for the famous landmark’s trust to take over Carriageworks’ operations.  Carriageworks announced on Monday night that it was going into voluntary administration as a consequence of the “irreparable” effects of the coronavirus crisis and the widespread shutdown on its income stream. The move has been described as “devastating” by artistic directors, individual arts practitioners and state and federal politicians alike. The appointed administrators, Phil Quinlan and Morgan Kelly from KPMG, have remained tight-lipped on the size of the organisation’s debts and who its primary creditors are. But their public statement, which notes they will be “exploring the possibility of a deed of company arrangement to stabilise Carriageworks’ financial position and allow it to continue its important role for Australian arts and culture”, suggests that they will be looking for a bailout. Reports emerged on Tuesday night that the NSW government was considering a proposal to pass management of the space to the Opera House Trust. In a statement, an Opera House spokesperson said the trust “has been approached by the government to consult on the long-term sustainability of Carriageworks as an important cultural venue, particularly at this most difficult time”. But there have been widespread calls for the bailout to come from the NSW government itself, as pressure grows on state and federal governments to do more to assist the arts sector in recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. Labor’s Walt Secord, the shadow arts minister for NSW, called for an emergency rescue package for arts organisations from the state government at a press conference on Tuesday, saying there was “a role for the state government” in assisting Carriageworks’ recovery. Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, in an opinion piece for the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, also called for a state government bailout using the funds for the “incredibly unpopular and shortsighted” $1.5bn plan to relocate the Powerhouse Museum from its current home in Ultimo to the western Sydney suburb of Parramatta. “It’s beyond time the state and federal governments ended their abandonment of artists, performers and those administering the arts organisations. They are left with the impression their jobs are not ‘real’ jobs, not important to our country like, say, mining or professional football,” Moore said. The piece follows similar calls on Tuesday for a bailout using the Powerhouse relocation fund from Greens MP Cate Faehrmann. A complex of performance and gallery spaces in repurposed 1880s locomotive workshops in Sydney’s inner west, Carriageworks has been a mainstay of Sydney’s cultural life since it opened in 2007, pivoting in recent years from a venue for hire towards a more fully rounded artistic organisation with its own commissioning program. The options for the organisation now depend to a certain extent on what it owes, and to whom. Carriageworks’ most recent financial statements, filed to the charities regulator, show an income stream heavily reliant on a combination of events and government support. In 2018, the company made $3.95m of its $11.6m reported income from events and venue hire, not including its regular farmers markets, which brought in an additional $1.1m. Support from grant programs totalled $3.16m in the same year, the vast majority of which was core funding from Create NSW, to the tune of $2.53m. The vast majority of expenditure – $7.05m of $12.2m that year – went towards staff salaries and wages, and the costs of putting on an artistic program. Many of Carriageworks’ staff were stood down in early April and hours for core staff were substantially reduced as the Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions on mass gatherings rolled out and public programs shut down.The arts sector has been calling on state and federal governments for weeks to commit to greater support for the sector, which was one of the first to feel the effects of the ban on mass gatherings and lockdowns of non-essential businesses. Esther Anatolitis, executive director of the National Association for Visual Arts and a staunch advocate for the arts industry, said the sector had been “united and clear” on its needs and demands. “We need to make sure that eligibility for support measures changes immediately, so that creative practitioners and businesses can access what they need. We need the $111.7bn creative industries to be recognised as the massive economic driver Australia cannot afford to lose, and that means targeted stimulus now,” she told Guardian Australia. After Carriageworks’ announcement on Monday, those calls have been picked up by other politicians, with federal Labor’s Anthony Albanese and Tanya Plibersek calling for more federal support on Twitter. The NSW government has provided some Covid-19 relief for small-to-medium arts organisations, mainly through the repurposing of existing funds in Create NSW into quick-response grants, accommodation and small projects. But it is also currently without a designated arts minister – the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has been acting in the role herself since Don Harwin resigned his post in April after staying at his central coast holiday house over Easter in breach of a Covid-19 “stay home” public health order. She has, to date, made no announcements about further arts stimulus for NSW. Given the state government already provides a large proportion of Carriageworks’ core funding, any negotiations for a bailout will likely need to be accompanied by at least some private philanthropy. According to the organisation’s last annual report, its philanthropy and sponsorship income totalled only 7% of its income. The administrators are due to hold their first meeting with creditors on 14 May.",culture
"On Late Night, Seth Meyers addressed the revelation this week that Donald Trump’s intelligence briefing book included coronavirus warnings throughout January and February. “While Trump was telling everyone it would disappear like a miracle and cases would soon go down to zero, he was getting private warnings that, actually, it was a big deal,” Meyers explained. “Which means either one of two things: he was lying, or he didn’t read it.” Both are probably true, because, as Meyers pointed out, “once Trump heard them refer to it as the novel coronavirus, he was never gonna read it, because he’s never gone near a novel. They should have told him it was called Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition coronavirus and he would’ve at least thumbed through it.” Additional reports confirmed that Trump regularly skips not only reading the briefing, but the oral summary delivered two to three times a week. “What do they have to do to keep this guy’s attention? Have his daily briefings delivered by pageant contestants?” asked Meyers, impersonating a chipper pageant girl: “My name is Brianna, I’m from Battle Creek, Michigan, and a new virus spreading across the globe has a 3.4% mortality rate!” But this tracks with what we know about Trump, Meyers concluded, and pointed to reports from early in Trump’s presidency that intelligence officials strategically placed his name, “killer graphics” such as photos and charts and tiny, and easily digestible “nuggets” of information in briefings to keep him reading. “He wants tiny nuggets! Killer graphics and to see his own name … so he wants a birthday party,” Meyers said. “He wants a child’s birthday party.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert acknowledged a grim milestone: as of Wednesday, America has more than 1 million coronavirus cases and more fatalities than the Vietnam war. “There’s no getting around it,” said Colbert. “It’s a solemn day – for everyone except presidential son-in-law and man watching you enjoy that lollipop Jared Kushner,” who on Wednesday described the federal government’s response to the virus as a “great success story” on Fox News. “Yes, it’s a great story – more people dying under this administration in 100 days than died in 20 years of the Vietnam war,” Colbert said in his snakiest Kushner impersonation. “That’s a story that need to be told, perhaps in the blockbuster movie Preventable Apocalypse Now.” Colbert also discussed Mike Pence’s visit to the Mayo Clinic this week, in which he defied policy and refused to wear a mask. “Finally, a medical explanation for why seeing Mike Pence’s face makes you feel ill,” Colbert deadpanned. Asked why he disregarded rules on Tuesday, the vice-president claimed that “since he didn’t have the coronavirus”, he figured not wearing a mask offered a “good opportunity” to “speak to these researchers, these incredible healthcare personnel, and look them in the eye and say thank you”. “You can still look them in the eye with a mask!” Colbert said. “It’s not a blindfold. Also, ‘I don’t have coronavirus’ isn’t an excuse for not protecting other people. That’s like a guy saying ‘I don’t need to wear a condom. I want to look you in the eye and say thank you.’” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee called attention to the US postal service, an essential, if often overlooked, institution in dire financial straits. It’s hard to get excited about the postal service, Bee admitted, but it’s “hot as hell … I mean the workers wear knee shorts, they give it to us in the rain, sleet and snow, and they’re the only federal agency built entirely around on the principle of licking stuff.” But without financial assistance from the government, it will run out of cash in June. Congressional Republicans rejected funding for the postal service in the latest stimulus bill, as Trump called it a “joke” and claimed it undercharges Amazon for its packages (his administration has debunked this) on account of his personal obsession with Jeff Bezos for owning the Washington Post. The postal service, crucial for mail-in voting, has seen volume drop by a third, more than 1,200 workers out with coronavirus and many more concerned about lack of basic supplies and protections on the job. Still, it’s “one of the only federal agencies directly authorized in the constitution, and it’s one of the most democratic institutions we have”, Bee explained. “But even if their voters like it, Republican leaders hate when the government actually works,” Bee added. “They’re been trying to undermine the postal service for decades, going back to 1982, when Ronald Reagan signed a law requiring NBC’s Thursday night lineup to feature at least one asshole mailman at all times.” In all seriousness, Republicans have in recent years tried to lower wages, reduce benefits and cut routes in an effort to privatize the service. “It’s ridiculous to expect the post office to be a money-making enterprise! It’s a public good,” Bee said. “Expecting the post office to turn a profit is like expecting public libraries to sell the right to use their bathroom.” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed food supply fears, as meat-processing plants across the country shut down due to coronavirus updates. Earlier this week, Trump signed an executive order under the Defense Production Act to keep some processing plants open and running at maximum capacity. “You know, I will say this about Trump: he is very clear about what his priorities are in life,” said Noah. “Because he was warned for months about the pandemic coming to America and he did practically nothing. But you tell the man once that there could be a beef shortage and he springs into action like the world’s hungriest superhero.” Still, few places in America have experienced higher rates of coronavirus than meat-processing plants. And “although there doesn’t seem to be a danger to the food itself, in most of these facilities, the workers are quite literally putting their lives on the line”. At many plants, several thousand employees work in close proximity; workers have alleged they were given hairnets to use as face masks. “It’s really sad that these workers are being forced to keep the food chain going but nobody is being forced to protect them while they do it,” Noah concluded. “They need equipment to keep safe while doing their jobs. And if you eat meat, you especially should want these workers to be treated right, because without them, the only way you’ll get your bacon is if you fight the pig yourself.”",culture
"An end to home schooling looks like it’s on the horizon in Australia, with many states now planning phased returns to classroom education. But the months of isolation and social distancing have seen parents and children drawing on deep reserves of creativity like never before.  For Sydney’s Simon Greiner, aka @TheCardboardDad on Instagram, isolation meant an escalation to his already impressive efforts to create a magical play world for his kids out of cardboard. Greiner started building his astonishing contraptions at the request of his four-year-old son. As each brief got filled, the next became more elaborate and specific – such as a “giant hand”, “a helicopter I can go in with a spinning propeller”, “a real castle I can go in with a drawbridge” or “a wrecking ball that lets me smash something down”. Soon they were coming in at an “alarming frequency”, Greiner says. “It’s a really nice way to play with my kids in a way that they really appreciate, and that I appreciate on a slightly different level,” Greiner says.  Greiner’s partner had already started hoarding cardboard before physical distancing was mandated (“there was a whole wad of it beneath the couch”), but an increase in deliveries due to the lockdowns compounded the collection. Old projects have to be surreptitiously recycled: Greiner says there is a “graveyard” of some of the bigger inventions on the family’s back porch – out of sight, out of mind until they become something else.  Anna Ryan-Punch and her 11-year-old son Luka have also been creating elaborate constructions with recyclables, though many of his projects have been set by his school inquiry class. They included building a machine of his choosing out of ordinary household bits and pieces. He designed and built a zipline out of a cup, some marbles, a bull clip and string.  “We had to raid and rinse out a lot of the recycling bin,” Ryan-Punch says. “It ended up being pretty hilarious, despite us both going, ‘Oh no we have to build another thing’.” Much more palatable to all involved were the cooking tasks, which required Luka to research something that interested him, draw a plan or recipe, and then follow it – with yields including scrambled eggs and chocolate chip cookies. Some parents, meanwhile, have been going off the map by necessity. For artist Lily Mae Martin and her nine-year-old daughter Anja, following the school curriculum at home hasn’t been a great success, so they started self-directed learning. Projects involved making paper dolls of the family together, using blocks to help Anja keep up with maths, and pulling apart an antique clock to study its mechanisms. Martin also painted a series of pictures of native animals at her daughter’s request so they could both learn more about them. “I think making kids feel safe and keeping their love of learning alive matters more at the moment,” Martin says.

"It’s been over six weeks of quarantine, and “like all of you, I’m sure, I’m just looking forward to the glorious day when this crisis is over and I can rip off my mask and go into a crowded room full of elderly people and lick them all,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. “And what gets me is that President Trump should’ve seen this Covid crisis coming.” Reports revealed this week that as far back as January, the president’s intelligence briefing book repeatedly cited the virus threat. “Well, there’s your problem!” said Colbert. “Those are three of Trump’s least favorite words: intelligence, briefing and book. If they really wanted him to pay attention, they should’ve called it his ‘Daily Pornographic Hamburger Firetruck’.” And on Monday, after scheduling, cancelling and rescheduling a press conference, Trump said he “can’t imagine why” people would heed his suggestion to drink bleach as a way to treat the coronavirus. “I can’t imagine why those people would follow your advice – it’s a real mystery,” Colbert deadpanned. “Specifically: ‘Nancy Drew and the Case of Bleach She Drank After Trump Told Her To.’” At the briefing, the Trump administration unveiled their “blueprint” to expand coronavirus testing capacity in the country, though it leaves the onus on states to develop their own plans. “So, their plan is: make someone else come up with the plan,” said Colbert, who noted that it literally calls the federal government the “supplier of last resort”. “Well, that is some inspiring leadership. Just like Braveheart: ‘They make take our lives, but they’ll never take our freedom! Anyway that’s the blueprint, good luck! I’m the fighter of last resort.’” In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also discussed the revelation that intelligence officials placed coronavirus warnings in Trump’s daily intelligence briefing book throughout January and February. “Book” was really the issue, Kimmel claimed. “The president doesn’t read books. If you wanted him to take it seriously, you should’ve tweeted him like a gif of a dancing cheeseburger.” In other news, Vice-President Mike Pence caused a stir on Monday when he toured the Mayo Clinic without a mask – the only one not to wear one on his tour, since the clinic has a strict mask-wearing policy. “You know the only reason he didn’t wear a mask is because Trump won’t wear one,” said Kimmel. “Mike Pence is required to keep his lips free at all times for kissing master’s ass.” After his visit, the Mayo Clinic tweeted: “Mayo Clinic informed [Pence] of the mask policy prior to his arrival today,” which was embarrassing, Kimmel said, although there might some logic to it: “I don’t know, maybe Mike Pence just wants to catch it already and be put out of his misery.” And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah unpacked the issues with the government’s paycheck protection program (PPP), which set aside $342bn to help small businesses through the pandemic shutdown. A couple weeks ago, before most businesses could receive help, “that money disappeared faster than Rudy Giuliani in direct sunlight,” said Noah. Congress returned with a second round of $310bn, but still, the money did not get to the businesses, as the Small Business Administration website portal for loan applications crashed almost immediately after launch on Monday. But it’s not just computer issues: “it turns out that the reason small businesses haven’t been able to get their money, is because the big businesses have been snapping it up,” said Noah. In the first round of the funding, $810m went to large, publicly traded companies, some with market values of over $100m, including the national restaurant chain Shake Shack and the Los Angeles Lakers. “I don’t care what anybody says, the Lakers do not need $4m,” said Noah. “The Knicks need $4m to bribe their fans to act like they don’t see what’s going on.” “It’s important to remember that although what these big companies did was shitty, it wasn’t illegal,” Noah continued. “They saw a chance – a chance to get money – and they took it. Which is what companies are always gonna do.” Which raises the question: “why didn’t the government come up with regulations to make sure that the money for small businesses actually went to small businesses?” Instead of keeping the big dogs out, the treasury ceded authority to the banks, “and then the banks did what the banks do, which is: screw over the little guys”, said Noah. Already, a lawsuit against four major banks – Bank of America, US Bank, Chase and Well Fargo – alleges the banks prioritized bigger customers (with their bigger bank fees) over small businesses. The PPP situation proves “you can’t leave the loan decisions up to the banks,” Noah concluded, as banks are businesses – they’re “always going to take care of its top customers first”. Furthermore, many small businesses are owned by women and African Americans, who often lack pre-exisiting relationships with banks. “So, if the banks didn’t know you before coronavirus, you’re definitely not going to be on their radar now,” said Noah, which is why some experts have warned that up to 90% of minority and women-owned businesses will be shut out of the paycheck protection program. “I don’t know how you fix this program overnight,” Noah concluded, “but if you’re a woman or a minority who owns a small business, I suggest you start practicing your jump shot, because that might be the only way you get some of this government cash.”",culture
"Looking every inch the metal drummer he is, Nat (no surname) is an unlikely Vera Lynn for our times. And yet, the Sydney comedian’s no-nonsense cookery segments are bringing comfort to the masses. “What’s going on, Iso-Lords?” he says, introducing his latest clip, The Crowd Goes Mild Curry. “We’re back in the kitchen, saying no to jar sauce.” Behind a sparkling-clean counter laden with fresh vegetables, spices and herbs stands Nat: black band T-shirt, hair halfway down his torso, arms and neck covered in tattoos. He walks us through the ingredients before getting stuck into the methodology. “If you’ve got one of these cheeky bastards, use this. It’s called a microplane. I know it sounds like a small aircraft, but it’s just a pretentious name for a fine grater. If you don’t have one of these pratty things you can just use a normal grater, and if you don’t think you’ve got one of these, you’re wrong. You’ve got four of them and they’re buried behind the other three.” The Nat’s What I Reckon YouTube channel has been in operation for 10 years, with 85,000 subscribers to Nat’s ocker brand of social commentary, rife with wordplay and colourful metaphors. Now he’s taken off to an even wider audience with recipes that wage war on processed food, like his End of Days Bolognese. Each video has clocked up around 5m views so far, and won him fans in the Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl, DJ Carl Cox and the actor Yael Stone. Sitting in a cluttered Sydney office on a Skype call with Guardian Australia, Nat apologies for being ineloquent. He doesn’t mean the fact that his dialogue is always peppered with swearing and mumbling, but the fact he’s trying to be helpful while struggling with fatigue. He works full-time on the clips with his girlfriend – he edits and answers messages, she films and designs – and says he’s not sleeping much from fielding business inquiries. “It’s just a fucking tidal wave at the moment,” he says, looking dazed. “It’s hard to remember anything.” Nat got the idea to diversify into cooking segments after the lockdown cancellation of what would have been his first live comedy tour (“heartbreaking”), but his own health kick was also an impetus. In earlier material, he’d wander around trade shows and art happenings with a mic, a perplexed attitude and what looked like a well-tended beer gut. “I’ve lost about 24 kilos,” he says. “I had one of my lungs removed a while ago and put on a bit of weight because I was pretty sick. Going to the gym wasn’t doing anything and the gut wasn’t helping my breathing, so I started looking into what food I was eating.” What better time to turn that knowledge into a public service than during the panic-buying of jar sauce and packet soup? “There’s a fresh food section in the supermarket that hasn’t been touched and yet empty shelves of pasta sauce,” he says. “You’re fucking stuck at home – what are you doing? Eat better.” Other Australian YouTube-reared comedians have covered the coronavirus pandemic in styles verging from satirical to political, such as Sooshi Mango, Alex Williamson and Jordan Shanks, but there’s something weirdly comforting – benevolent, even – about Nat’s grouchy big-brother style. Maybe it’s his “settle down” tone (even if he’s actually arguing about the fact we shouldn’t be putting zucchini in spag bol), or the fact he avoids shaming people, other than the odd “make sure you wash your fucking hands, you grubs”. “Sometimes parents remake my videos with their kids and send them to me,” he says. “It’s pretty unreal that kids are digging it. I’m not going to judge your parenting.” Damo is a Sydney-based chef (and a friend of mine) who watches Nat’s videos with his 11-year-old and nine-year-old, who’ve started spinning and whistling, Nat-style. “He hit a chord with us because he feels familiar and we think we’d enjoy hanging out with him,” says Damo. He’s not surprised to hear that Nat’s dad was a chef who taught his son to cook. “He knows what he’s doing in the kitchen – I assumed that he was trained because he knows how to use a knife. “One other thing that made me admire him is that during one video he said something like, ‘Just have a go, you’re more talented than you realise.’ I thought, this guy’s genuine, that’s a really nice thing to prop people up with. Then I found his videos on depression and anxiety, and I gained shitloads of respect for him.” Damo’s talking about one of Nat’s segments called Is It Sh*t?, in which he once reviewed his own anxiety, and the comedian was also an ambassador for The Big Anxiety festival from the University of New South Wales in 2019. His current bio describes his work as “holding up a mirror to masculine culture”, though I can’t help wondering if he’s retrofitted that, since he surely started out just recording whatever made his mates laugh. “I’ve always made fun of that narrow-minded boofhead thing,” Nat says, not taking offence. “The trade-show reviews I did were all about sticking it to boys’ clubs. Boats, burnouts, that kind of shit.” That’s true; as well as his review of “massive money hoon” the Sydney Boat Show, which was the turning point for his popularity, he’s affectionately lampooned revhead events such as Canberra’s Summernats. Not using his surname saves him some grief from the dedicated car crowd. So far, Nat’s What I Reckon has mostly been monetised through a merchandising line. The comedian avoids the sponsorship deals that are rife among social media figures, “given that the whole point is it’s me and what I reckon”. Still, it’s likely that international touring, once restrictions lift, will fill the coffers – though Nat can’t figure out how his hefty American fanbase can even understand him. For now, his Australian tour has been rescheduled for September, and it’s nearly all sold out. Broader than standup, which he’s done for a couple of years, it will draw on multimedia and interactive crowd skits, and he’s turned his anxiety into a game show. All that’s missing is a set from one of his bands, Penalties or Keggerdeth. “[Until then] I’m going to keep doing what I’m doing, smashing out videos, because it seems to be working,” he says. “The plan is to keep my hands on the wheel and hang on for dear life.”",culture
"Derry Girls has been critically acclaimed (the first season holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and smashed ratings records in Ireland and the UK, but despite international distribution via Netflix it’s remained criminally under-watched – at least based on my metric of asking everyone I know if they’ve watched the show and being disappointed by the answers. Here’s the pitch I use to try to convince people to give it a go: “Imagine a show like The Inbetweeners but funnier, with a heartwarming and realistic portrayal of female friendship, that tackles heavy themes like politics, religion and war, and English people are the punchline of every second joke. Oh, and it has a great 90s soundtrack.” It never fails. The sitcom follows four teenage girls, Erin, Orla, Clare and Michelle, as they grapple with the universal problems of being a young adult: intrusive parents, strict Catholic school teachers, crushes, and violent sectarian conflict. Or at least they’re the universal problems faced by teenagers living in Northern Ireland in the 1990s, which is when the show is set. Derry Girls’ genius is its ability to perfectly balance genuinely hilarious moments of teenage humour, wholesome meditations on friendship and love, and coming-out stories alongside a serious engagement with the politics of the era. If you didn’t think jokes about teenage romance could be bolstered by a long-running religious conflict, you haven’t heard Michelle defend her crush on a Protestant: “I think there’s something really sexy about the fact that they hate us so much.” Created and written by Lisa McGee, the show is inspired by her own childhood growing up in Derry during the Troubles, a conflict generally considered to have begun when the city’s Catholic majority protested against Protestant political rule in 1969, sparking the Battle of Bogside. Three years later British soldiers shot 26 unarmed Catholic protesters in Derry, killing 13. The event is known as Bloody Sunday and it had a galvanising impact on the Irish republican movement. The legacy of these events is never far away in Derry Girls. Shots of British soldiers patrolling the streets feature in most episodes, and radio and TV news broadcasts of the conflict regularly punctuate family dinners. It even creeps into school life. “Nobody actually gets expelled,” Michelle says. “Rhonda Gallagher hasn’t even been expelled and she’s in the IRA.” “I’d say that’s probably why,” Erin replies. One of the show’s highlights is the relationship between the girls and Michelle’s cousin James. He serves as the show’s punching bag not only because he’s the only boy in a Catholic girls’ school (“Why can’t I find the boys’ toilet?”) but also because he’s an Englishman surrounded by Irish nationalists. “I can’t tell my rebellions from my risings,” he mourns during one group work assignment. “And whose fault is that?” Michelle fires back. “If your lot had stopped invading us for five fucking minutes there’d be a lot less to wade through! English prick.” The 90s setting gives us more than just an examination of the effects of the Troubles on school kids, though. It allows us to wade in nostalgia, and simultaneously marvel and cringe at the fashion and aesthetics of the era. It’s a useful device to help create atmosphere, but it never feels tokenistic – all the cultural references help deliver an emotional impact, and that’s most obvious in the music choices. The soundtrack is full of classic 90s acts such as Ace of Base, Blur, Cypress Hill, Salt-N-Pepa and, of course, the Corrs. But the best choice of music is saved for the first season’s emotional finale. The girls are performing a dance to Madonna’s Like A Prayer for their Catholic school’s talent show, a perfect way to express the bonds of their friendship. It’s a musical choice loaded with symbolism given the song’s music video led to a Vatican-initiated boycott campaign and protests around the world by Catholics. As the girls are dancing on stage, the show abruptly cuts to Erin’s family watching a news broadcast of a bombing that’s just taken place and Dreams by the Cranberries starts drowning out Madonna. The grief and resignation on the faces of Erin’s parents is a stark contrast to the sheer and absolute joy that only dancing with your friends to iconic pop music can bring. The fact that Derry Girls can regularly pull off these moments of fun and hilarity, and in the same breath force us to reckon with the impact of political violence is why it’s such an irresistible show.",culture
"What is “X Æ A-12”, and why is it trending on Twitter? That, my friend, is the name of tech billionaire Elon Musk and musician Grimes’ first child together. At least according to Elon Musk, who tweeted “X Æ A-12 Musk” when one of his 33.7 million followers demanded to know his newborn baby’s name. Is this … real? Or is he trolling? Probably both, in a sense. Most people are working under the assumption that Musk’s tweet is a code for the baby’s real name. The fact Grimes’ has a track on her latest album, Miss Anthropocene, named ‘4 Æ M’; as in “for Æ Musk”, lends weight to the theory. Then Grimes stepped in to clear things up with a brand new cypher that explained Æ stands for AI and X stands for ‘X’. Glad we’re all on the same page then. But seriously, what does it say on the birth certificate? There are several working theories on how to pronounce ‘X Æ A-12 Musk’ and what it might mean at the moment. What we do know is that the Lockheed A-12 fighter jet’s original code name was ‘Archangel’ – which is pretty on brand for both Musk (who likes aircrafts so much he’s building a space program) and Grimes (who uses plenty of biblical references in her work). As for the ‘X’; one follower guessed ‘Xavier’ which is unlikely, given Musk already has a son named Xavier; Neal, Alexander and Sasha are also popular guesses. As is straight up ‘X’. There was speculation that Æ referred to the ligature Ash. But now Grimes has stepped in to clear things up, it’s possible the baby is really named Xai Archangel Musk. Or, you know X Æ A-12 Musk. As for the “metal rat” bit – a Chinese Zodiac calendar makes that line a little less weird than it originally sounds. Why are people so fascinated with this couple?The pair both had pretty obsessive fan communities going into the relationship – many of whom (mostly Grimes fans) had mixed feelings about them as a couple. Since then there’s been a constant stream of drama about them, including a run in with ubiquitous beefer Azealia Banks, a lot of complaints about their mismatched politics (she’s been a Bernie supporter since 2016; he thinks we should “FREE AMERICA NOW”) and, of course, the baby build up. Grimes announced she was pregnant on Instagram by posting a photoshopped image of herself with a translucent, Space Odyssey-esque fetus inside her, and at the time no one was sure if it was a record teaser or an actual declaration that she was with child. Later she confirmed the news with a more confessional, conventional post, so I’d say that, much like a new Tesla model release or a album drop this is a phased marketing campaign for the miracle of life. But then again, he once got into a Twitter feud with a hero navy diver, so heated it ended up in court; and her entire pop persona is built around weirdness, so who knows what it really says on the birth certificate. Where does this sit on the mad celebrity baby name spectrum?If it’s not a code and the kid really is named X Æ A-12, I’m going to go ahead and award the name five out of five Moon Units. It’s definitely weirder than Blue Ivy (who also has her name worked into plenty of her mum’s creative output); Apple and Moses; Shiloh and Pax, or even Nicholas Cage’s kid Kal-El. But, more likely, it’s a code for Xai Archangel – something a bit more normal sounding than, say, Kulture Kiari Cephus or Raddix Madden. Perhaps in an alternate timeline they would have gone with Pilot Inspektor, but sadly, it’s already taken. Whatever next? How does the next famous baby go further? Are we looking at the child of Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid being called a series of emojis?Honestly, I think weird celebrity baby names are becoming passe. With all the Daeneryses; Marvels and Teslas running around (seriously, 141 babies were named for Musk’s automotive brand in 2017) – calling your kid Kyd, just doesn’t seem that provocative anymore.

"The announcement on Monday that Sydney’s Carriageworks had entered voluntary administration came as a shock for an arts community already in brace position. “It’s the first big announcement like this but I can tell you now, it won’t be the last,” says Esther Anatolitis, executive director of the National Association of Visual Arts. “What we’re seeing right across Australia is a total loss of self-generated income for galleries. As yet, there’s no strategy looking at how to financially support galleries so that they will be able to survive and reopen.” Carriageworks has been one of the jewels of Sydney’s performance and exhibition venues since 2007, hosting some of the largest-scale art installations seen in Australia at its historic 50-hectare site at the Eveleigh rail yard complex. It served as a hub for festivals and provided a home to leading arts companies. The organisation had its income projections for the current financial year trashed as the coronavirus crisis unfurled, with big-ticket events cancelled or suspended. The decision to enter into administration was sealed when the New South Wales government – which currently does not have an arts minister after the recent resignation of Don Harwin – declined to guarantee future funding. Rumours are swirling about a possible takeover of the venue by the Sydney Opera House. But Carriageworks’ exposure to commercial headwinds is no greater than many others in the sector, says Anatolitis. The Covid-19 shutdown has come hard on the heels of cuts to Australia Council funding and a summer of bushfires that had an impact on gallery attendance and operations, most notably in Canberra. All galleries Australia-wide are closed until further notice. Most if not all are taking considerable financial hits while continuing to manage multimillion-dollar collections and maintain a level of community outreach. Regional galleries have been hard hit by drought, fire and the resulting loss of tourist traffic. “There’s barely been time to recover from that and now we have a global pandemic for which there is no treatment and no vaccine,” Anatolitis says. Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art has accessed the jobkeeper scheme in order to maintain its staff, says its director, Liz Ann Macgregor. “It’s been a lifeline,” she says. “I can’t even begin to tell you of the scenarios we were working through before jobkeeper was announced. All I can say is that they were truly horrible.” Government funding accounts for about 25% of the MCA’s budget, says Macgregor. The rest comes from venue hire (including weddings and corporate events), the museum’s retail and café operations, and philanthropy. Apart from special exhibits, the MCA does not charge an entrance fee. “That was our much-lauded funding mix,” Macgregor says with an exasperated laugh. “And before this crisis, everyone thought that was a great thing. Even the GFC didn’t impact us very much. But this time, 40% of our income vanished overnight. It throws into question the whole orthodoxy of that kind of funding. Those of us who developed really good business models are particularly suffering, much more so than the institutions who get 60, 70, 80% of their funding from government.” The MCA’s philanthropic community has been supportive. “Actually, they’ve been fantastic, telling us that they understand we can’t use the money in the way we wanted to but to please spend it to keep the museum going,” Macgregor says, adding that she has ruled out bringing back an admission fee for the MCA. As it stands, access to the jobkeeper scheme is not an option for Australia’s local council, university or state-owned institutions. “Our permanent full-time and temporary staff continue to work behind the scenes while our doors are closed to the public,” says Michael Brand, director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. “During this period we have also sought to retain and redeploy a number of our regular casuals within the gallery.” Adelaide’s Art Gallery of South Australia is in a similar position. “We’re doing all we can to look after our small number of casuals, some of whom are assisting us to deliver our online programs,” says Rhana Devenport, AGSA’s director, adding that permanent and contract staff had been asked to exhaust all leave entitlements. Like all arts and entertainment enterprises, Australia’s art galleries are keenly awaiting updated advice on social distancing. Galleries, says Anatolitis, are in a far better position to reopen in the next few months than theatres and concert venues. “Galleries are, almost by definition, controlled environments. We can absolutely control the number of people in a space and when we walk into a gallery we don’t generally stand close to other people because art demands, quite often, a deep and solitary response.” Until physical reopening is permitted, galleries and museums nationwide are increasing their digital footprints in order to maintain connections with their communities and artists. The MCA has a virtual tour of its Sydney Biennale exhibition, the Art Gallery of NSW has Together in Art, and the National Gallery of Victoria has virtual tours, including jumping early on digitising its blockbuster Haring/Basquiat (resulting in more than 50,000 online views so far), and the AGSA has a raft of podcasts and talks around 2020 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art: Monster Theatres. Devenport says despite AGSA expanding further into digital, there is much more to be done in what is “an extraordinarily challenging time”. She says what’s needed now is a political strategy that puts the arts at the centre of the population’s long-term wellbeing. Brand agrees: “Art museums will have to play a greater role than ever to support and assist our art communities to survive the pandemic, recover, then thrive again in the long term. This will require enormous action. Some of our initial actions now might be quite small in scale but they will set the tone for what will follow.” Macgregor believes it is important to keep art galleries and museums afloat for economic as well as cultural reasons. “When all this is over, there is going to be a huge growth in domestic tourism and galleries and museums are real drivers in that market. [State] borders are going to open again and all those people who normally go overseas and spend money – something like $6bn – are going to be here and we want to grab some of that, but the museums are going to have to work together,” she says. “Cultural tourists spend three times as much as other tourists, so for the sake of the economy, we need a stimulus package that will allow organisations like ours to reopen.”",culture
"Jimmy Kimmel apologized on Monday night for retweeting a misleading video which appeared to show Vice-President Mike Pence choosing to carry empty boxes of PPE supplies for a photo-op. “Apologizing to the Trump administration for spreading untruth is like apologizing to Barry Bonds for using steroids. It’s hard,” Kimmel said. It was especially hard, Kimmel added, because outrage directed at him for the mistake “was disgusting. Stupid, too, but mostly disgusting,” especially personal attacks on his family. Kimmel blasted “these people who blindly pledge their allegiance to Donald Trump instead of this country” for their hypocrisy, which “runs so deep they don’t even seem to be aware of it any more. It’s like when an Uber driver wears too much cologne.” Kimmel apologized on Twitter on Friday, yet Pence’s communications director tweeted repeatedly and exclusively about the mistake on Friday, and, Kimmel added, emailed him to demand an apology on-air, “because this is what they’re thinking about while thousands of Americans are dying every day: jokes from late-night talkshow hosts.” Still, “it was my mistake, I do apologize to the vice-president again for spreading misinformation about him – spreading misinformation is their thing and I stepped on their toes,” Kimmel said. “Now that I’ve done that, I’d like the vice-president, since he asked me to apologize, to ask his boss, who lies every time there isn’t a McNugget in his mouth, to apologize for the following perversions of decency and democracy,” Kimmel said, listing off some of the Trump administration’s most egregious actions, including: separating children from their parents at the border, inviting the Taliban to Camp David, siding with Putin over US intelligence, calling neo-Nazis “very fine people”, “ignoring warnings on coronavirus, downplaying the dangers of coronavirus, mishandling the coronavirus, we still don’t have tests for the coronavirus, why are we opening the country when we have no tests for coronavirus?” Perhaps inevitably, the Twitter feud was escalated by Trump, who took time from his Mother’s Day on Sunday morning to call Kimmel a “last place” host. “So, anyway, this is what the White House is working on and thinking about right now,” Kimmel said. “This really is the dumbest time to be alive.” “For months, President Trump has been saying the coronavirus pandemic isn’t as big a deal as everyone is suggesting, but now the virus is responding by saying, ‘knock, knock, byatch,’” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show, reacting to news that two White House staff members – Trump’s valet and Pence’s press secretary (and wife of Stephen Miller) Katie Miller – tested positive for the virus. “Oh snap, the coronavirus is now officially in the White House, and that’s scary. Although if it’s like everything else that lands in the White House, it won’t last more than a few weeks,” Noah said over a photo grid of fired Trump staffers. “I won’t lie,” he added, “I’m not surprised that this cluster started in Stephen Miller’s house – that dude has always given off major bitten-by-a-bat vibes.” And yet, the president still refuses to wear a mask. Last week, he and Melania, both sans masks, attended a ceremony for the 75th anniversary of victory in Europe which included several veterans in their 90s. “Whatever Trump’s excuse was, I just hope all those veterans are safe,” said Noah. “Because could you imagine surviving Hitler, only to be taken out by Trump? That would be so anticlimactic. It would be like if Batman beat Bane, and then died slipping on a banana peel.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also addressed the White House’s coronavirus outbreak – specifically, Trump’s apparent incomprehension of testing’s importance. In a press conference on Friday, Trump said of Katie Miller: “She was tested very recently and tested negative, and then today, I guess, for some reason, she tested positive.” “In the history of dumb things said by Donald Trump – and remember, there will one day be a library filled with them – that might be the dumbest thing he’s ever said,” said Colbert. “Does Trump think the tests are good only if they tell you news you want to hear? ‘My girlfriend took a pregnancy test – it said she wasn’t pregnant. Then we had a bunch of sex, and for some reason all of a sudden, it says she’s having a baby. That’s why these tests aren’t so great. The tests really should start wearing a condom.’” On Monday afternoon, “to make himself feel better” about his plummeting approval ratings, Colbert said, Trump held a press briefing in the Rose Garden, “and he got it going with one of his classic lies,” telling reporters: “If somebody wants to be tested right now, they’ll be able to be tested.” “OK, that’s not true,” Colbert interjected. “Lots of people want a test but they can’t get one, because they don’t play in the NBA or aren’t a tiger in the Bronx zoo. So if you want a test, you have to work on your three-pointer or eat a raw gazelle.” “Anywhere between one to two thousand Americans are dying every day from the coronavirus and yet rather than confront that reality, Trump is doing the only thing he knows, and that’s lying his way through it,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. “He’s trying to dead-eye mind-trick Americans into thinking coronavirus will simply go away.” For example, Trump told reporters on Friday that coronavirus would soon disappear, even without a vaccine, despite news that two White House staffers had tested positive and a letter from the White House management office encouraging staff to “practice maximum telework” and to “work remotely if at all possible”. “Well, that’s easy for Trump since he’s already spent the last three years teleworking from his home office on the 18th green at Mar-a-Lago,” Meyers deadpanned. “Every time you see him in the Oval Office, that’s just his Zoom background. “Think about that: the president is telling people to get back into the workforce while his own White House tells employees to stay home,” Meyers continued. “One day he’s going to call a press conference to tell us that murder hornets are fake news while a dozen of them carry him back to their nest.”",culture

"Hi Josh. I’ve just seen a video in which many Australians appear to be smashing their televisions. What is happening please? It’s all about a former reality TV star from Melbourne, his growing Facebook following, and protests against the coronavirus lockdown, media, vaccines, 5G and microchips. Now I am even more confused. How did it start? In April a former reality TV show star, Fanos Panayides, started a Facebook group called “99% unite Main Group ‘it’s us or them’”. In a month it has grown to nearly 40,000 members. There is no real united message in the group except for claims people are not being told the whole story on a wide variety of things: from vaccines, to alleged microchips being installed in the population, to conspiracy theories connecting 5G technology to the coronavirus. Some people are simply opposed to the lockdown. It’s a whole grab bag. Last week Panayides told his followers to smash their TVs in protest of the media “telling us what to think”. Panayides smashed his own TV in his backyard declaring TVs were terrorising the world, and we needed to take the power back. Dozens of his followers followed suit, filming themselves taking hammers and other tools to their own TVs. Panayides still has a TV, however, because in a later video on Facebook he showed a video of it. Since then, he and a group of people from the group protested outside parliament over the lockdown in Melbourne on the weekend. Panayides was one of 10 people arrested over the protest, which police said were in breach of the social distancing rules. Video has circulated online of police moving in to stop Panayides speaking at the event after he attempted to read a verse from Revelations in the Bible which, he says, talks about microchips. I’ve heard about people attacking cell towers and telecom workers in the UK. Is this the same as that? In the initial stages of the pandemic, debunked conspiracy theories blaming the 5G rollout for spreading coronavirus proliferated around the world – mainly on Facebook groups like this one. But while the people attacking those towers were likely also influenced by something they read on Facebook, they didn’t come from exactly the same group. Still, although Facebook has banned posts connecting 5G with coronavirus, it wasn’t hard to find posts on the group complaining about 5G, and connecting it with the Cedar Meats outbreak in Victoria. How do people think 5G could even spread a virus? The reasoning varies depending on the conspiracy you are reading, but the most common one seems to be that because 5G was being rolled out in Wuhan at the time of the outbreak, it must have had some role in it (it didn’t). Other conspiracies falsely claim 5G “poisons cells” or makes it easier to catch coronavirus. None of this is true. Does this all have something to do with controversial reality TV chef and David Icke enthusiast Pete Evans? Again, also adjacent. A word that keeps coming up in the group is “Plandemic”, and Pete Evans’ increasingly conspiratorial Facebook and Instagram feeds have mentioned this word too. Plandemic is a 26-minute documentary that is now banned from Facebook for spreading misinformation about coronavirus. Vimeo and YouTube have also removed it from their platforms. In the video, discredited researcher Judy Mikovits makes a number of inaccurate claims about the origins of Covid-19. One claim, among others, is that Covid-19 is being spread to force vaccines on to the population as a form of control. Mikovits also falsely claims you can retransmit coronavirus to yourself by wearing a face mask. This all sounds bonkers. What’s our leadership doing? The chief health officer Brendan Murphy called out the people trying to connect 5G to coronavirus, stating it was “silly misinformation” and “complete nonsense”. He said: “5G has got nothing at all to do with coronavirus.” Prime minister Scott Morrison was more sympathetic to the protesters over the weekend, stating he understood their frustrations over the restrictions. “It’s a free country, people will make their protest and make their voices heard. But equally, that needs to be done in an appropriate way and it needs to respect the law enforcement authorities who are just simply trying to do their job. So we understand it’s a difficult time and those issues will be dealt with in the normal way.” So they’re not doing heaps then. No – but these protests are not really all that well-attended compared to the ones in the US, so it might be a case of trying to ignore it and hoping it goes away?",culture
"How do you preserve a pandemic? Libraries, museums and historical associations around the world are struggling to survive right now but they’re also asking themselves this critical question. They know future generations will inevitably study Covid-19 – so what are the moments and materials we should capture for people in the future, and how can we capture them? Collecting institutions around Australia have launched a series of projects aimed at creating coronavirus archives, and key to the ongoing efforts are the contributions of the general public. The State Library of Victoria is working to enlist an army of citizen collectors who can help it gather Covid-19 related materials. This is the idea behind Memory Bank: A Collective Isolation Project, the library’s major pandemic archiving project. “A citizen collector really needs to be an anthropologist for the future and to think about the kinds of things that we take for granted that someone in the future may find absolutely fascinating,” says a senior curator, Carolyn Fraser. She lists leaflets, pamphlets and temporary take-out menus as examples of items that the library might be interested in acquiring. In addition to asking people to hold on to pandemic paraphernalia, the library is also releasing a series of weekly prompts which will encourage people to share details about their pandemic lives. The first prompt was “What’s in your fridge or pantry today?” Few of us would think to photograph our fridge or pantry, but knowing what’s in there could be useful for future scholars. “Things like receipts and shopping lists that, within the context of an archive, are really, really telling for people beyond this moment, may seem like rubbish to us now,” Fraser says. Dr Peter Hobbins, a medical historian, is also working to preserve pandemic-related ephemera. He started the #covidstreetarchive, a grassroots project encouraging people to photograph their streets and neighbourhoods, and to share their snaps on social media. The hashtag is filled with images of familiar sites: “closed” signs in shopfronts, empty streets and teddy bears in windows. “The idea behind the #covidstreetarchive comes out of having been a historian who has studied the 1918-19 influenza pandemic and being aware that there are huge gaps in how we understand what it was like living through that period,” Hobbins says. He notes that our understanding of domestic life and the impact of the 1918 flu on businesses is particularly limited, and he hopes that starting Covid-19 archiving efforts now will help minimise similar gaps for future historians. In many ways, we’re already primed to preserve a pandemic. Smartphones and social media make it easy for us to share details about our daily lives. The New South Wales State Library embarked on a similar project to Hobbins’, asking people to share pictures from self-isolation on social media using the hashtag #NSWathome. By the end of April, thousands of photos had been shared on the hashtag via Instagram and Twitter, from self-isolation dinners and baking projects; home improvement and home-schooling projects; and images of contributors attending Zoom work meetings, workouts and happy hours. People are also being encouraged to keep a written record. The Diary Files is another of the Covid-19 projects launched by the SLNSW. A collective journalling project, contributors are invited to write and share short reflections on their circumstances. Early contributors include the literary and cultural personalities Tim Ross, Gretel Killeen, Michelle Law, Tony Birch and Wendy Sharpe, giving accounts of their experience during self-isolation. Bruce Baskerville, a historian involved in a similar project at the Centre for Western Australian History, is also encouraging people to keep a record of their thoughts, feelings and observations. “This is creating the archive that historians and researchers will use in the future to see how ordinary people experienced this event,” Baskerville says. Historians and curators involved in collecting efforts acknowledge that they don’t know how future generations will use the archives. Your social media snaps could end up in a museum exhibition; your diary entries could be the basis for a podcast; the teddy bear in your front window could feature in a material history of the pandemic. As Fraser says: “There’s a huge range of possibilities, and probably possibilities that we can’t even imagine right now.”",culture

He moved to London in 2002 and won the 2004 Place Prize’s audience award for his sextet Cult. In 2008 he founded the Hofesh Shechter Company, and made his Royal Ballet debut in 2015 with Untouchable.

It’s an eclectic, surprising and ever-changing spring of new art by new artists. I love that our situation weirdly gives birth to being exposed to more, and unpredictable, artistic content. Being a member of such an unpredictable art form as contemporary dance, I’m a fan of mixed bags. Surprises are healthy. If you have a strong heart. Unorthodox (Netflix) This mini-series is a surprisingly realistic depiction of Jewish Orthodox life. A powerful piece. It took me way back to my childhood in Jerusalem, where I witnessed close and far family members, either within, or brushing close to, the Orthodox community. It’s about a member of the Orthodox community in Brooklyn breaking free from the mental and emotional prison of that community without really knowing that she was in a prison. It’s very hard to understand how free we are or not, or whether we are just stuck in a culture we agreed with because we didn’t have a choice. It’s a fascinating and touching story that made me question my own world, my own bubble and beliefs. The cast is unknown to me and it was a pleasure to discover such brilliant acting by unfamiliar faces. Pierre Bensusan: Azwan Pierre Bensusan is an incredibly gifted guitar player – more of an artist, really, or a poet. Some of his solo albums make it hard for the ear to believe that he is playing it all solo, which he does. This is not to take away from the humongous heart that goes into his playing. It’s sweet, melancholic, beautifully ancient-sounding at times, and will transport you into the evening with a dreamy stare in your eyes. Bensusan’s latest album, Azwan, features some talented guest musicians too. Azul My partner and I are rediscovering old-fashioned board games that require a good amount of time and headspace. Azul, in which one has to gain points by collecting colourful tiles and ordering them cleverly on the board, is very pleasant on the eye and mathematically lightly challenging.

The recipe has too many oats in it, so I reduce it a little. It’s delicious and hearty and not that unhealthy! (No sugar – until you put on the maple syrup.)",culture
"Oh, thank God that’s over. Feels so good to be out and about again, meeting people, hugging the grandchildren. And wow! We’re on a giant waterslide in the jungle too! Wait, there’s Iain Duncan-Smith in a smoking jacket, giving me notes on my 100-stanza poem about a magic breakfast. Luckily, I can shoot him dead and – oh, I see brain, thanks a lot. Just another dream, shattered before I could even pull the trigger. Cheers. Now I’m awake, pursued by news. I abseil quickly past the mass graves, past Trump’s latest mad ramblings in the style of Tony Soprano’s mum, past The Collapse of Everything. I reach the bottom of the Guardian homepage and stay there for a while, staring gratefully at the image of a harmless toasted cheese sandwich. It’s just an article about making the perfect sandwich. I want to burst into song, or tears. Remember happier times, when there was only full-spectrum eco-cide to fear? Update: once you’ve pushed through the novel-virus-sphere, all the Old Testament bangers are still there. War. Famine. Noah-level maxi-floods. Forests of pure fire. Religious poison sprayed into the air from the Midwest to the Middle East. ALSO, melting Arctic ice is about to release a whole new toxic anthology of ancient pandem classics: rare Mesolithic deep cuts, some real body-slamming hard-plague ward-fillers. Perhaps as a nod to this larger narrative, the weather here in Lancaster has been full-on sarcastic. Really sunny, but with crazy gusting wind. A bit like being on holiday in Spain except, instead of that chilled feeling of waiting for an enormous seafood lunch and another cold bottle, there’s a very different chilled feeling, like the dread of waiting day after day for test results. Meanwhile, normal chit-chat with Harry Next Door about mice and meds has hit full cosmic implosion. Some of the morning tablets he laid out last thing at night have been eaten by a mouse.

My grandsons, who live in Seoul, went back to nursery school last week – in masks, but still. Our little pond’s alive with tadpoles.

And police? Good cheer? We’re taking that with a spoonful of sugar, yeah? For anyone who loves wearing a hi-vis and bossing people about like Mary Poppins with a taser, lockdown has been truly bumptious. Community policing now apparently includes deciding whether yoga’s proper exercise in a park, whether gin or pencils are essential items, and bellowing “People are DYING!” when challenged. (Sidenote: I am now ending every argument with this line.) Last week, HM Government’s mysterious Orwellian nudgethink (“You Are Safer Indoors”, “Watch Television and Carry On” “You Could … Bake Something?”) took a sinister turn with: “BREAKING THE RULES IS BREAKING THE LAW.” What bloody rules? Finders keepers? Fight Club? Do not ask for credit as a refusal often offends?  The creatures outside looked from the executive to the legislative and from legislative to executive, and from executive to legislative again – but already it was impossible to say whether the Magnum, which had been on the ground for more than five seconds, should be eaten. People say: “You’re a writer, I bet you haven’t noticed any difference. You just stay indoors and type anyway. Wanker.” Fair enough and, yeah, I count my blessings. As it stands, I’m Extremely Vulnerable and Shielded. Things could be worse. Obviously, I could “get it” and my lungs, already hollow cathedrals of Gothic tracery, would be carpet-bombed, Dresdened. Or I could be one of Toby Young’s Old Expendables, shuffling off to the local fentanyl pod for the glory of the herd. We all dream our weird dreams alone.

"Iain Stirling, voice of Love Island, standup comedian I remember everything in terms of football. It was the day Liverpool played Atlético de Madrid and, as I watched, I felt a bit fluey, meaning I had the symptoms of coronavirus. I had a gig in London the next day and with about five hours to go we cancelled, along with the shows in Brighton and Cardiff. At that point, I thought: “Hopefully I’ll feel better and then we can carry on.” But then Boris Johnson announced lockdown, and I had to postpone the entire spring leg of my tour, plus the recording of my Amazon Prime special.  Luckily, because most of my material isn’t topical, I haven’t had to rip it all up. I tried a few coronavirus jokes back in February, but as soon as I mentioned it the audience went a bit weird. It’s difficult to joke about something when you’re all in the same room, breathing the same air. I don’t know whether people will want to laugh about coronavirus when this is over, or pretend it never happened.  Not doing Love Island this year is a blow. You think because it’s such a big show, they’ll find a way to make it happen. But postponing it is the right thing to do. I’ve spent so many summers in Spain now that it’s going to be weird not to be out there. For the first few weeks of lockdown, my partner Laura [Whitmore, who presents] said she felt like she was in the audience of a gig every time we had dinner. I had to do something with that energy – it was either that or run down the street screaming at couples – so I’ve started doing live streams on Twitch.  I can’t wait to get back on Love Island. Watching all the contestants being introduced is my favourite bit. Do they have funny surnames? Is there a turn of phrase or mannerism I can pick up on? I want to meet the new islanders more than anything. I need more islanders in my life. Laura Wade, dramatist We were just gearing up for the debut of The Watsons in London’s West End when everything shut down. All the cast had been engaged, and we were about to choose understudies. Knowing that these 17 people were expecting to be in work this summer and now aren’t has been the hardest bit. You feel a responsibility. The Watsons, my adaptation of the unfinished novel by Jane Austen, had such a long gestation. I can’t quite believe it’s gone. Maybe I’m in denial, but I do believe it will come back. I’m not sure where or how though. Too much is in the air. I know the show’s producers will do everything they can to get it back up and running.  The best thing about being a playwright is having a play on. We write to communicate, to share our stories. Getting into rehearsals, getting a play on stage, that’s what I live for. So it feels extremely sad right now. But everyone in the industry is in the same boat. It’s not like only my show got cancelled because, say, the finance fell through. You have to be humble about your own disappointment, and see the bigger picture.  I wonder what theatre will be like after coronavirus. Will there still be audiences? What will they want to see? What will be able to afford to give them? I know we are an industry of resourceful and imaginative people. We won’t give up without a big fight. The aliveness of theatre is such a special, specific thing. I can’t see it going away.  Wayne McGregor, choreographer I’ve never had anything cancelled before in my career. Now, thanks to coronavirus, around 80 shows I was involved in around the world have been cancelled.  I’d been working on The Dante Project, a three-part epic that was due to premiere at the Royal Opera House in London this month. It took three years to bring together. The score was done, the designs were finished, and we were just about to go into rehearsals with the Royal Ballet when everything shut down.  The actual cancellation was quite quick and brutal. I found out in March just after my 50th birthday. The Royal Ballet had planned a celebration for me, to go alongside the Dante premiere, which would have been lovely. I’m generally an optimist, though. I’m pretty good at dealing with what life throws at me. The most difficult thing for me has been my company. I have a company of 50 people and they’re my biggest concern. Trying to work out how it can have a life in the future has taken a huge amount of energy.  The creative arts will always be vibrant, but this is a key moment for the government to realise their crucial value to everyday life, and support the industry. The experience of watching a play, a ballet, a live performance, when you’re all in the same space, breathing the same air together – that’s such a special thing.  Catherine Cohen, comedian and actor In early March, I did this fun show in Washington DC with a bunch of female comedians. After the show, I asked them: “I’m meant to go to London in two days. Do you think that’s a bad idea?” And they were like: “No, it will be fine. You should go!” So I flew to London and there were six people on my flight. There was this weird energy in the air, but my show was sold out and went amazingly. Afterwards, I was hugging a bunch of people and having drinks at the bar. I got back to my hotel room at 3am and finally had a chance to check my phone. There was a message from my mum saying: “You need to come home right now!” I cancelled the rest of my London shows and flew back. I’m dying to get back to performing. I host a weekly show at Club Cumming in New York’s East Village and I miss it so much. I’ve started hosting it every Wednesday on my Instagram Live, which is useful, because having a show to prepare for helps me remember what day of the week it is. But it’s no replacement for the energy of performing in front of a live crowd. My mood changes on the hour. Some days I wake up with a knot in my stomach, feeling hopeless, thinking that everything I’ve ever worked for in my career has disappeared. And then other days I think: “What a wonderful opportunity to pause, reflect – and reinvent my artistic process!” Jack Bevan, drummer, Foals We were at Heathrow airport, on our way to tour Asia, just as everything started to shut down. When we arrived at Manila, in the Philippines, everyone at the airport was having their temperature checked. Then our Manila gig got cancelled the day before we were meant to play. We flew back to the UK and were in lockdown about a week later.  I feel sorry for emerging bands who would have been promoting debut records this summer. They’ll be hit the hardest. If coronavirus had happened to us the year our first album came out, or even our second, it would have crippled us. We might have been dropped by our label. But because we’re more established, we’ve been able to take a year off touring. Still, it hurts. Festivals account for approximately 80% of our income. The impact on artists is huge, but it’s also devastating for people who aren’t talked about so much – the road crew and the venue staff, who may not fall into the furloughing scheme. We’ve been selling fans Foals T-shirts to support the crew. We’ve actually sold 3,000, which helped tide them over for a few months.  We haven’t been able to get in a room to play because of the lockdown rules – and I’m itching to do it. This is the longest I’ve gone without playing the drums since I was 14. Our initial plan was to spend 2020 touring, then and go back into the studio next year. But I think we’ll probably start writing later this year instead, and get back to touring next year — if we’re allowed.  Chelsea Wolfe, singer-songwriter It was wild watching everything happen. I went from being on a tour bus on my way to Berlin to buying flights, driving straight to the airport, and getting on a chaotic plane home to the US. My crew and I almost didn’t make it back. After Trump announced a ban on all arrivals from Europe, the airlines started price-gouging. Flights were jumping from a few hundred dollars to thousands right in front of our eyes.  There was definitely a period of mourning when I got home. I poured so much into Birth of Violence, my last album, and I was so looking forward to getting it out to people on tour. I thought I might still be able to do my later tour dates, but then the entire European leg was cancelled, followed by Australia and New Zealand. I live in northern California, near the mountains. Now I wake up in the morning, do a Zoom yoga class, and start making music in my home studio. Once I got over the shock of being at home, it was nice to be creative again. I work on songs with my bandmates, going back and forth via email.  The financial stuff is scary. Cancelling the tour was huge. I’d already invested so much money into booking the tour bus, renting the gear, paying for my crew, the flights, a week of their time for rehearsals, the stage dressings. None of that stuff is refundable. I’ve been able to sell some tour merch, which helps. It’s been cool to see fans wanting to support artists. Lots have left comments online saying: “I was meant to see you play live, but I bought a T-shirt instead.”",culture
